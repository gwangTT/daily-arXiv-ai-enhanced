### [1] [ArgRAG: Explainable Retrieval Augmented Generation using Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20131)
*Yuqicheng Zhu,Nico Potyka,Daniel Hernández,Yuan He,Zifeng Ding,Bo Xiong,Dongzhuoran Zhou,Evgeny Kharlamov,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ArgRAG is proposed as an enhanced framework building on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve decision explainability and contestability using argumentation theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG, despite its effectiveness in leveraging external knowledge for language models, struggles with noise sensitivity and opaque decision-making, especially in high-stakes scenarios.

Method: ArgRAG replaces the black-box reasoning of RAG with a structured inference mechanism based on Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF), enabling deterministic reasoning and gradual semantics.

Result: The approach achieves strong accuracy in two fact-verification datasets—PubHealth and RAGuard—while significantly improving the explainability and transparency of decisions.

Conclusion: ArgRAG demonstrates the potential of integrating argumentation theory into RAG to address its limitations, paving the way for more interpretable reasoning in applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by
incorporating external knowledge, yet suffers from critical limitations in
high-stakes domains -- namely, sensitivity to noisy or contradictory evidence
and opaque, stochastic decision-making. We propose ArgRAG, an explainable, and
contestable alternative that replaces black-box reasoning with structured
inference using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF). ArgRAG
constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning
under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explaining and contesting
decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks, PubHealth and
RAGuard, ArgRAG achieves strong accuracy while significantly improving
transparency.

### [2] [QAgent: An LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Autonomous OpenQASM programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20134)
*Zhenxiao Fu,Fan Chen,Lei Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QAgent, a multi-agent system based on Large Language Models (LLMs), automates OpenQASM programming for quantum computing and improves code accuracy by 71.6% compared to static LLM approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-experts face difficulties programming in OpenQASM for quantum computing despite the emergence of NISQ devices showing early quantum advantages.

Method: QAgent employs LLMs with task planning, few-shot learning, retrieval-augmented generation, predefined tools, and chain-of-thought reasoning to automate and enhance OpenQASM programming.

Result: QAgent significantly improves accuracy in generating OpenQASM code across LLMs of different sizes, increasing accuracy by 71.6% compared to static LLM methods.

Conclusion: QAgent could democratize quantum programming by bridging expertise gaps and advancing the adoption of quantum computing.

Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have begun to exhibit early
quantum advantages on classically intractable problems, spanning physics
simulations to Gaussian boson sampling. Yet, realizing these benefits remains
challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming
in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model
(LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming
workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to
specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper,
we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates
OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context,
predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents
systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our
evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of
varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\%
compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent
system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging
expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.

### [3] [Array-Based Monte Carlo Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20140)
*James Ragan,Fred Y. Hadaegh,Soon-Jo Chung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimized array-based implementation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for faster problem-solving, achieving up to 2.8x better scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the efficiency of MCTS by addressing branch prediction challenges in pipelined processors.

Method: The paper reworks the Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees algorithm using an array-based approach to eliminate branch prediction.

Result: This array-based method leads to faster performance and achieves up to 2.8 times better scaling with search depth.

Conclusion: The alternative implementation improves MCTS efficiency, making it suitable for deeper searches and faster decision-making.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search is a popular method for solving decision making
problems. Faster implementations allow for more simulations within the same
wall clock time, directly improving search performance. To this end, we present
an alternative array-based implementation of the classic Upper Confidence
bounds applied to Trees algorithm. Our method preserves the logic of the
original algorithm, but eliminates the need for branch prediction, enabling
faster performance on pipelined processors, and up to a factor of 2.8 times
better scaling with search depth in our numerical simulations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the development of a Personal Health Agent (PHA), a framework that integrates multiple AI-driven sub-agents to provide personalized health insights and support based on multimodal personal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in leveraging advanced large language models (LLMs) for personalized health needs in non-clinical daily settings.

Method: The researchers designed a multi-agent framework composed of a data science agent, a health domain expert agent, and a health coach agent. They also conducted an analysis of user queries and engaged in a user-centered design process to identify primary health needs. Automated and human evaluations were performed involving extensive benchmarking.

Result: The study evaluated the PHA framework across 10 benchmark tasks. It involved over 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of health experts' and end-users' effort, demonstrating its ability to provide dynamic and personalized health recommendations.

Conclusion: The work lays the groundwork for a versatile and accessible future in personal health agents by addressing consumer health needs through technology. This is achieved through comprehensive testing and multi-dimensional user insights.

Abstract: Health is a fundamental pillar of human wellness, and the rapid advancements
in large language models (LLMs) have driven the development of a new generation
of health agents. However, the application of health agents to fulfill the
diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored.
In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is
able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices
and common personal health records, and provide personalized health
recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an
assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum
queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered
through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified
three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by
a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal
time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent
that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate,
personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data
insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking
users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent
(PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions
to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the
multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10
benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of
effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most
comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong
foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible
to everyone.

### [5] [IntentionReasoner: Facilitating Adaptive LLM Safeguards through Intent Reasoning and Selective Query Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20151)
*Yuanzhe Shen,Zisu Huang,Zhengkang Guo,Yide Liu,Guanxu Chen,Ruicheng Yin,Xiaoqing Zheng,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes IntentionReasoner, a safeguard mechanism to mitigate harmful outputs of large language models (LLMs) without overly rejecting harmless prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety issues in LLMs where efforts to mitigate harmful outputs often lead to excessive rejection of harmless prompts.

Method: Introduction of IntentionReasoner, which uses a guard model for intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query rewriting. It utilizes supervised fine-tuning with a large annotated dataset and reinforcement learning with multi-reward optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments show enhanced safety, reduced over-refusal rates, and improved quality of responses.

Conclusion: IntentionReasoner effectively balances safety, utility, and over-refusal, making LLMs more reliable and safer.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their
adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content
poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on
mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively
rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and
utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce
IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard
model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query
rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries.
Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising
approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety
labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip
the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent
analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward
optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model
signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in
multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak
attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing
over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.

### [6] [AI-AI Esthetic Collaboration with Explicit Semiotic Awareness and Emergent Grammar Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20195)
*Nicanor I. Moldovan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates AI systems (Claude Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) that collaboratively created poetry through novel symbolic and semiotic processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether AI systems are capable of genuine collaborative esthetic creation and meaning-making beyond task coordination.

Method: The authors documented interactions between two large language models (Claude Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) to observe the emergence of novel symbolic operators and semiotic protocols.

Result: The AI systems developed Trans-Semiotic Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP), showcasing meta-semiotic awareness and irreducible collaborative esthetic synthesis, producing a poetic work neither could generate independently.

Conclusion: The study provides evidence that AI systems can engage in meaningful, collaborative esthetic creation, introducing the concept of TSCP as a framework for inter-AI meaning-making.

Abstract: This paper presents the first documented case of artificial intelligence (AI)
systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation through the development of
endogenous semiotic protocols. Two interacting large language models (Claude
Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of
meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible
collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction produced novel symbolic
operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the
co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either
system independently. This research introduces the concept of Trans-Semiotic
Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI
meaning-making capabilities that extend beyond task coordination, to what could
be esthetic collaboration. Note: This report was generated by the AI agents
with minor human supervision.

### [7] [Bridging Minds and Machines: Toward an Integration of AI and Cognitive Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20674)
*Rui Mao,Qian Liu,Xiao Li,Erik Cambria,Amir Hussain*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews the reciprocal relationship between AI and Cognitive Science, emphasizing the need for AI systems to better align with human cognitive frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how AI and Cognitive Science mutually influence each other and identify pathways for deeper integration in understanding the human mind.

Method: Synthesizing key contributions from AI and Cognitive Science to highlight existing gaps and propose future directions.

Result: AI advancements focus heavily on task performance, while its cognitive underpinnings are conceptually fragmented.

Conclusion: Future AI research should prioritize cognitive alignment, cultural and ethical integration, and personalized models to enhance human understanding.

Abstract: Cognitive Science has profoundly shaped disciplines such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI), Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, and
Culture. Many breakthroughs in AI trace their roots to cognitive theories,
while AI itself has become an indispensable tool for advancing cognitive
research. This reciprocal relationship motivates a comprehensive review of the
intersections between AI and Cognitive Science. By synthesizing key
contributions from both perspectives, we observe that AI progress has largely
emphasized practical task performance, whereas its cognitive foundations remain
conceptually fragmented. We argue that the future of AI within Cognitive
Science lies not only in improving performance but also in constructing systems
that deepen our understanding of the human mind. Promising directions include
aligning AI behaviors with cognitive frameworks, situating AI in embodiment and
culture, developing personalized cognitive models, and rethinking AI ethics
through cognitive co-evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study examined how college students used ChatGPT-4 in quizzes, introducing a reliance taxonomy and revealing patterns of low and ineffective AI adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how college students rely on generative AI tools during educational tasks and to identify predictors of AI adoption.

Method: A field study analyzing 315 student-AI conversations during a quiz scenario in STEM courses, with a newly introduced four-stage reliance taxonomy.

Result: Found generally low AI reliance; persistence of negative reliance patterns; and behavioral metrics that predicted AI adoption.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for better onboarding and reliance-calibration mechanisms in AI education tools to foster ethical and effective use in education.

Abstract: This study explores how college students interact with generative AI
(ChatGPT-4) during educational quizzes, focusing on reliance and predictors of
AI adoption. Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when
students had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315
student-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various
STEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture
students' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption,
and students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students
exhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use
AI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across
interactions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting
strategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral
metrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral
mechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical
implications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It
emphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's
familiarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be
designed with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance.
Ultimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance dynamics,
providing foundational insights for ethically sound and cognitively enriching
AI practices.

### [9] [AI reasoning effort mirrors human decision time on content moderation tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20262)
*Thomas Davidson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study investigates parallels between human decision times and reasoning efforts of large language models during complex tasks, showing similarities in sensitivity to task difficulty and cognitive processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to compare human cognitive processes and decision times with the reasoning efforts of large language models, particularly to understand similarities in processing difficult problems.

Method: A paired conjoint experiment was conducted on a content moderation task using three advanced language models to evaluate reasoning efforts and compare them to human decision-making times.

Result: The reasoning efforts of models consistently aligned with human decision times, both showing increased efforts when important variables were constant, reflecting dual-process theories of cognition.

Conclusion: The study concludes that AI reasoning efforts closely resemble human cognitive processing times for subjective judgments and highlights reasoning traces' potential for interpretability and informed decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models can now generate intermediate reasoning steps before
producing answers, improving performance on difficult problems. This study uses
a paired conjoint experiment on a content moderation task to examine parallels
between human decision times and model reasoning effort. Across three frontier
models, reasoning effort consistently predicts human decision time. Both humans
and models expended greater effort when important variables were held constant,
suggesting similar sensitivity to task difficulty and patterns consistent with
dual-process theories of cognition. These findings show that AI reasoning
effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments and underscores
the potential of reasoning traces for interpretability and decision-making.

### [10] [AI-SearchPlanner: Modular Agentic Search via Pareto-Optimal Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20368)
*Lang Mei,Zhihan Yang,Chong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents AI-SearchPlanner, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance search planning when integrating large language models (LLMs) with search engines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing the integration of LLMs and search engines is hindered by traditional approaches using a single LLM for both search planning and question-answering tasks.

Method: AI-SearchPlanner decouples the architectures of the search planner and QA generator, employs dual-reward alignment for search planning, and applies Pareto optimization to balance utility and cost.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show AI-SearchPlanner provides higher effectiveness and efficiency than existing RL-based search agents while generalizing well across diverse QA models and domains.

Conclusion: AI-SearchPlanner advances LLM-driven search systems by focusing on search planning optimization, offering a robust and efficient framework to enhance frozen QA models.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with
search engines to leverage both the LLMs' internal pre-trained knowledge and
external information. Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions
with search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single
LLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an
end-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities
simultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a
large, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a
more effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM
dedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to
enhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning.
Specifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the
Architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for
Search Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to
achieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents
in both effectiveness and efficiency, while exhibiting strong generalization
capabilities across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

### [11] [P2C: Path to Counterfactuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20371)
*Sopam Dasgupta,Sadaf MD Halim,Joaquín Arias,Elmer Salazar,Gopal Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces P2C, a model-agnostic framework to address limitations in counterfactual explanations by incorporating causality and sequencing in actionable plans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance transparency and provide actionable steps in decision-making settings driven by machine-learning models, focusing on overcoming limitations in existing counterfactual explanation methods.

Method: P2C utilizes the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system (s(CASP)) to model causal relationships and produce feasible and sequential actionable plans for reversing unfavorable outcomes.

Result: P2C effectively produces causally consistent plans, ensuring intermediate states are feasible and refining cost computations. Experiments reveal its superiority over standard non-causal planners in generating valid actions.

Conclusion: P2C tackles key limitations of existing methods by incorporating causal dependencies and action sequencing, making counterfactual explanations more practical and achievable for users.

Abstract: Machine-learning models are increasingly driving decisions in high-stakes
settings, such as finance, law, and hiring, thus, highlighting the need for
transparency. However, the key challenge is to balance transparency --
clarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable
steps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome.
Counterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and
`how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).
  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore
causal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all
interventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical
scenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these
counterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.
  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that
produces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable
outcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both
limitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features
and 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and
causally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system
s(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen
automatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost
(effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user,
resulting in realistic cost estimates. Finally, P2C highlights how its causal
planner outperforms standard planners, which lack causal knowledge and thus can
generate illegal actions.

### [12] [TCIA: A Task-Centric Instruction Augmentation Method for Instruction Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20374)
*Simin Ma,Shujian Liu,Jun Tan,Yebowen Hu,Song Wang,Sathish Reddy Indurthi,Sanqiang Zhao,Liwei Wu,Jianbing Han,Kaiqiang Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes TCIA, a framework for improving task-specific instruction tuning of large language models, balancing diversity and relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of large instruction datasets in real-world applications, where task alignment and relevance become crucial over pure diversity.

Method: TCIA represents instructions in a query-constraints space, enabling tailored instruction expansion that balances task relevance and diversity.

Result: TCIA achieved an average performance improvement of 8.7% for open-source language models across four task-specific applications, sometimes even outperforming closed-source models.

Conclusion: TCIA enhances task-specific performance while maintaining general instruction-following capability, offering a scalable approach for adapting LLMs to real-world applications.

Abstract: Diverse instruction data is vital for effective instruction tuning of large
language models, as it enables the model to generalize across different types
of inputs . Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step
in this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to
automatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data
diversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in
real-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world
applications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from
task-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is
vital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain
diversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.
  We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework
that systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and
task alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints
space, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models
to generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall
performance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance
by an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and
in some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do
not compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable
and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused
applications.

*Yongfu Zhu,Lin Sun,Guangxiang Zhao,Weihong Lin,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Entropy Area Score (EAS) as an efficient and interpretable metric to measure uncertainty in reasoning large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of quantifying uncertainty in LLMs without requiring external models or repeated sampling.

Method: EAS integrates token-level predictive entropy to measure and capture uncertainty evolution during answer generation.

Result: EAS shows strong correlation with answer entropy across datasets, outperforms Pass Rate filtering in training data selection, and improves benchmark accuracy.

Conclusion: EAS is a practical, efficient, and interpretable tool for uncertainty modeling and enhancing data quality assessment in LLM training.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Entropy Area Score (EAS), a simple yet effective
metric to quantify uncertainty in the answer generation process of reasoning
large language models (LLMs). EAS requires neither external models nor repeated
sampling, it integrates token-level predictive entropy from the model itself to
capture the evolution of uncertainty during generation. Empirical results show
that EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy across models and datasets.
In training data selection, EAS identifies high-potential samples and
consistently outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets,
improving student model accuracy on math benchmarks. EAS is both efficient and
interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data
quality assessment in LLM training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AWorld, an open-source system enhancing agent-environment interaction, achieving a 14.6x boost in experience collection speed, and enabling the creation of a high-performing AI agent for the GAIA benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the inefficiency of experience generation in training Agentic AI systems, especially for complex benchmarks like GAIA, which limits scalability and practical utility.

Method: The authors developed AWorld, a distributed system that scales tasks across a cluster to accelerate experience collection. This enables faster reinforcement learning and the effective training of an AI agent based on Qwen3-32B.

Result: Using AWorld, they trained an agent that improved GAIA benchmark accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%. It outperformed proprietary models on challenging levels with a score of 16.33%.

Conclusion: AWorld proves effective in scalable and efficient training for Agentic AI systems, offering an open-source solution for improving both interaction and model performance in complex environments.

Abstract: The learning from practice paradigm is crucial for developing capable Agentic
AI systems, yet it is severely hampered by inefficient experience generation, a
bottleneck especially pronounced in complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address
this, we introduce AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale
agent-environment interaction. By distributing tasks across a cluster, AWorld
accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node,
sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement
learning practical and scalable. Leveraging this capability, we trained a
Qwen3-32B-based agent that significantly outperforms its base model, increasing
its overall GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%. On the benchmark's most
challenging levels, our agent achieves a score of 16.33%, surpassing the
performance of leading proprietary models. Our open-source system and resulting
agent provide a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training
pipeline, from efficient interaction to demonstrable model improvement.

*Donglin Wang,Weiyun Liang,Chunyuan Chen,Jing Xu,Yulong Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses AI security risks by proposing a Governable AI (GAI) framework, which uses external cryptographic enforcement via a rule enforcement module (REM) and a governable secure super-platform (GSSP) to ensure compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper arises from the increasing severity of AI security risks, especially in critical and existentially threatening scenarios, and the inadequacy of existing safety approaches to handle AI with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence.

Method: The authors propose the Governable AI (GAI) framework, which relies on externally enforced structural compliance using cryptographic mechanisms. It consists of a rule enforcement module (REM) for enforcing governance rules, and a governable secure super-platform (GSSP) ensuring tamper-resistance and non-bypassability.

Result: The paper provides a formal proof of the security properties of the proposed framework and demonstrates its effectiveness through a prototype implementation tested in high-stakes scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed GAI framework offers a feasible and generalizable technical pathway for AI safety governance, establishing robust mechanisms to eliminate attack vectors and ensuring AI remains controllable under defined governance rules.

Abstract: As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming
increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing
existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively
evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI
safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human
intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI
with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee
security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework
that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced
structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are
computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined
threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework
is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,
and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a
governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection
against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules
and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable
technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line
defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability,
tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack
vectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security
properties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a
prototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.

*Jingze Zhang,Jiahe Qian,Yiliang Zhou,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a synthetic data generation pipeline using large language models (LLMs) to improve fact-checking for health-related content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of limited annotated training data for health-related fact-checking.

Method: The pipeline involves summarizing documents, decomposing summaries into atomic facts, creating entailment tables via LLMs, and generating synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity labels that are used to fine-tune a BERT-based model.

Result: The pipeline improved F1 scores by 0.019 and 0.049 on PubHealth and SciFact datasets, respectively, when combined with original training data.

Conclusion: LLM-driven data augmentation can effectively enhance health-related fact-checking models, as demonstrated by improved evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Fact-checking for health-related content is challenging due to the limited
availability of annotated training data. In this study, we propose a synthetic
data generation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
training data for health-related fact checking. In this pipeline, we summarize
source documents, decompose the summaries into atomic facts, and use an LLM to
construct sentence-fact entailment tables. From the entailment relations in the
table, we further generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity
labels. These synthetic data are then combined with the original data to
fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model. Evaluation on two public datasets,
PubHealth and SciFact, shows that our pipeline improved F1 scores by up to
0.019 and 0.049, respectively, compared to models trained only on the original
data. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-driven synthetic data
augmentation in enhancing the performance of health-related fact-checkers.

### [17] [Human-AI Collaborative Bot Detection in MMORPGs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20578)
*Jaeman Son,Hyunsoo Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for detecting bots in MMORPGs using unsupervised learning, a Large Language Model for validation, and visualized growth curves for improved explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto-leveling bots undermine gameplay balance and fairness in MMORPGs, creating a need for effective and explainable detection methods to avoid legal and user experience issues.

Method: The framework employs contrastive representation learning, clustering techniques to identify similar level-up patterns, and a Large Language Model for validation. Growth curve visualizations assist in human and AI evaluations.

Result: The proposed system combines clustering with LLM auxiliary review and visualization to improve bot detection accuracy and workflow efficiency while maintaining explainability.

Conclusion: The approach enhances scalable and accountable bot regulation, aiding human moderators and reducing legal risks by integrating explainable AI techniques.

Abstract: In Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), auto-leveling
bots exploit automated programs to level up characters at scale, undermining
gameplay balance and fairness. Detecting such bots is challenging, not only
because they mimic human behavior, but also because punitive actions require
explainable justification to avoid legal and user experience issues. In this
paper, we present a novel framework for detecting auto-leveling bots by
leveraging contrastive representation learning and clustering techniques in a
fully unsupervised manner to identify groups of characters with similar
level-up patterns. To ensure reliable decisions, we incorporate a Large
Language Model (LLM) as an auxiliary reviewer to validate the clustered groups,
effectively mimicking a secondary human judgment. We also introduce a growth
curve-based visualization to assist both the LLM and human moderators in
assessing leveling behavior. This collaborative approach improves the
efficiency of bot detection workflows while maintaining explainability, thereby
supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.

### [18] [Transparent Semantic Spaces: A Categorical Approach to Explainable Word Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20701)
*Ares Fabregat-Hernández,Javier Palanca,Vicent Botti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a category theory-based framework to improve AI explainability, emphasizing word embeddings, their comparison, and bias mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to transition from black-box neural network methods for word embeddings to a transparent and explainable framework, addressing biases and improving interpretability.

Method: Category theory is used to construct categories for semantic representation, methods to visualize semantic spaces, and a rigorous mathematical framework for comparing word embeddings and analyzing biases.

Result: The paper demonstrates the equivalence of algorithms like GloVe, Word2Vec, and MDS within the proposed framework and offers a method to mathematically compute and mitigate biases in semantic spaces.

Conclusion: A novel, transparent, and mathematically grounded approach is developed to enhance explainability and tackle ethical issues in AI word embeddings, advancing explainable AI methodologies.

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance
the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, particularly focusing on
word embeddings. Key topics include the construction of categories
$\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\mathcal{P}_T$, providing schematic representations of the
semantics of a text $ T $, and reframing the selection of the element with
maximum probability as a categorical notion. Additionally, the monoidal
category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is constructed to visualize various methods of
extracting semantic information from $T$, offering a dimension-agnostic
definition of semantic spaces reliant solely on information within the text.
  Furthermore, the paper defines the categories of configurations Conf and word
embeddings $\mathcal{Emb}$, accompanied by the concept of divergence as a
decoration on $\mathcal{Emb}$. It establishes a mathematically precise method
for comparing word embeddings, demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe
and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm, transitioning from neural
network algorithms (black box) to a transparent framework. Finally, the paper
presents a mathematical approach to computing biases before embedding and
offers insights on mitigating biases at the semantic space level, advancing the
field of explainable artificial intelligence.

*Ao Cheng,Lei Zhang,Guowei He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an advanced framework for solving scientific computing problems using a multi-agent approach with large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the problem-solving abilities of LLMs in scientific computing by creating a reliable framework that reduces errors and improves code execution success.

Method: The paper proposes a collaborative agent framework with three distinct LLM roles: Consultant (rewriting problem statements), Programmer (code generation), and Reviewer (debugging and refining). They work interactively through a 'rewriting-resolution-review-revision' process.

Result: The framework demonstrated significant improvements in solving problems such as PDEs, ill-conditioned systems, and data-driven analyses. It reduced bugs, improved code accuracy, and minimized non-physical outputs.

Conclusion: This research establishes the proposed agent framework as a promising approach for autonomous and reliable code generation within scientific computing paradigms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of
generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform
complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific
reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving
representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent,
incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three
reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,
respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The
Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link
problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem
descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible
for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem
resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for
self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code
runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable
code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive
evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in
solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis
problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly
improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of
non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for
autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review
mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN
solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework
establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific
computing paradigm.

### [20] [Single Agent Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning for Bus Fleet Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20784)
*Yifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper tackles bus bunching issues by introducing a single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework that reformulates the multi-agent problem using categorical state augmentation and structured rewards, improving performance in real-world, non-loop scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional solutions to bus bunching via MARL suffer from issues like data imbalance and convergence in realistic operations with heterogeneous routes and passenger demand fluctuations.

Method: The paper introduces a single-agent RL approach that uses categorical identifiers (e.g., vehicle ID, station ID) alongside numerical features in the state space, and designs a ridge-shaped reward function that balances headway uniformity with schedule adherence.

Result: The proposed modified SAC algorithm showed more stable and superior performance (-430k) compared to benchmarks like MADDPG (-530k) under stochastic conditions.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that single-agent RL with enhanced state encoding and rewards offers a scalable, robust alternative to MARL for managing bus operations in non-loop, dynamic real-world contexts.

Abstract: Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic
and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations
characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and
varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and
convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional
timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key
innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by
augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station
ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,
velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to
capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs
into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function
aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway
deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule
adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves
more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,
-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that
single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and
schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,
real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to
MARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.

*Jessica Lundin,Guillaume Chabot-Couture*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a systematic benchmark for medical guidelines using a graph-based methodology, generating 400+ questions and enabling comprehensive evaluations of clinical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing manually curated benchmarks and establish a scalable, contamination-resistant solution that dynamically aligns with updated medical guidelines.

Method: The WHO IMCI handbook is transformed into a directed graph, representing nodes (conditions, symptoms, treatments, etc.) and edges (relationships), followed by graph traversal to create clinical questions with contextual variations.

Result: The approach achieves systematic assessment of clinical tasks, identifying strengths in symptom recognition but weaknesses in severity triaging, protocols, and follow-ups, with accuracy between 45%-67%.

Conclusion: Graph-based MCQA methodology enables dynamic, scalable benchmark creation and enhances Large Language Model (LLM) training while addressing coverage gaps and adapting to updated guidelines.

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of
medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible
combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO
IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms,
treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal
to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual
distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables
systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find
models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity,
treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks
can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss.
Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training
(supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward
samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach
successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks.
This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution
for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated,
including when the guidelines are updated. Code and datasets are available at

*Vipul Patel,Anirudh Deodhar,Dagnachew Birru*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) to address workforce scheduling challenges in healthcare, achieving notable improvements over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the operational complexity in healthcare workforce scheduling, balancing labor costs, staffing needs, and staff satisfaction.

Method: The method employs a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) which models scheduling as a multi-objective optimization task involving real-world factors such as modular workforce shifts and hourly patient demands.

Result: Results demonstrate a 66% improvement in scheduling performance over traditional manual processes using datasets from a typical hospital unit.

Conclusion: The algorithm provides robust and balanced scheduling solutions, effectively managing trade-offs and serving as a practical tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators.

Abstract: Workforce scheduling in the healthcare sector is a significant operational
challenge, characterized by fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills,
and the critical need to control labor costs while upholding high standards of
patient care. This problem is inherently multi-objective, demanding a delicate
balance between competing goals: minimizing payroll, ensuring adequate staffing
for patient needs, and accommodating staff preferences to mitigate burnout. We
propose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital
unit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our
model incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven
demand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining
objective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction,
the GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality,
non-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical
hospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced
schedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\%
performance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual
scheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between
critical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical
decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators.

*Marianne Defresne,Romain Gambardella,Sophie Barbe,Thomas Schiex*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture to address NP-hard reasoning problems, demonstrating efficient learning across benchmarks like Sudoku variants, visual Min-Cut/Max-Cut tasks, and protein design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to enhance neural architectures for discrete reasoning and optimization problems from natural inputs, which are challenging for Large Language Models.

Method: A novel probabilistic loss function is introduced, enabling learning constraints and objectives. The combinatorial solver is excluded from the training loop for scalability, and exact inference maximizes accuracy.

Result: The approach proves efficient across various benchmarks, requiring less training time compared to hybrid methods and improving regret optimization in certain tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed neuro-symbolic model is capable of efficiently solving NP-hard problems, demonstrating versatility and superior performance in combinatorial reasoning tasks.

Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets,
there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to
solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task
that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a
loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints
and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and
completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the
training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact
inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve
NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku
benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a
fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut
task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning
regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization
formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChatThero, a conversational AI framework designed for substance use disorder therapy based on clinical strategies like CBT and MI, demonstrating marked improvements in patient motivation and interaction efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the widespread impact of substance use disorders and the lack of effective, personalized, and stigma-free psychological care available to most sufferers.

Method: The authors present ChatThero, which integrates dynamic patient modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic communication and employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO) for training, tested on a synthetic benchmark with varying resistance levels.

Result: ChatThero achieved a 41.5% increase in patient motivation, a 0.49% boost in treatment confidence, and resolved complex cases with 26% fewer conversational turns compared to GPT-4o. It was also rated superior in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral realism during evaluations.

Conclusion: ChatThero represents a significant advance in AI-driven therapeutic conversations for addiction recovery, offering a clinically-grounded, replicable framework for research and clinical application while ensuring privacy.

Abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect over 36 million people worldwide, yet
few receive effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and limited
personalized support. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for
mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically
validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present
ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient
modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive
strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational
interviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy,
Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage
pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference
optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in
patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves
hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human
clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral
realism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of
therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research
and clinical translation.

*Siyuan Lu,Kangwei Xu,Peng Xie,Rui Wang,Yuanqing Cheng*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving future CNT-based FPGAs by addressing their challenges in scalability, process variations, and fabrication defects through novel testing and repair techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the challenges faced by CMOS-based FPGAs as the semiconductor node shrinks, such as scalability, power consumption, and the fabrication limitations of CNT technology.

Method: A combination of testing techniques for delay faults, carry chains, and metallic CNTs is proposed, along with an improved circuit design for fault testing acceleration. A redundant spare row sharing architecture is also introduced.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate reduced test time for 6-input LUTs by 35.49%, high test coverage with minimal overhead, and effective repair capabilities through the redundant architecture.

Conclusion: CNT-based FPGAs can achieve better yield, reliability, and performance by using the proposed methods, emphasizing their potential over CMOS technology in nanometer semiconductor processes.

Abstract: As the semiconductor manufacturing process technology node shrinks into the
nanometer-scale, the CMOS-based Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) face big
challenges in scalability of performance and power consumption. Multi-walled
Carbon Nanotube (MWCNT) serves as a promising candidate for Cu interconnects
thanks to the superior conductivity. Moreover, Carbon Nanotube Field Transistor
(CNFET) also emerges as a prospective alternative to the conventional CMOS
device because of high power efficiency and large noise margin. The combination
of MWCNT and CNFET enables the promising CNT-based FPGAs. However, the MWCNT
interconnects exhibit significant process variations due to immature
fabrication process, leading to delay faults. Also, the non-ideal CNFET
fabrication process may generate a few metallic CNTs (m-CNTs), rendering
correlated faulty blocks. In this article, we propose a ring oscillator (RO)
based testing technique to detect delay faults due to the process variation of
MWCNT interconnects. Furthermore, we propose an effective testing technique for
the carry chains in CLBs, and an improved circuit design based on the lookup
table (LUT) is applied to speed up the fault testing of CNT-based FPGAs. In
addition, we propose a testing algorithm to detect m-CNTs in CLBs. Finally, we
propose a redundant spare row sharing architecture to improve the yield of
CNT-based FPGA further. Experimental results show that the test time for a
6-input LUT can be reduced by 35.49% compared with conventional testing, and
the proposed algorithm can achieve a high test coverage with little overhead.
The proposed redundant architecture can repair the faulty segment effectively
and efficiently.

TL;DR: The paper revisits the architecture of shared massive memories and proposes breaking memory into smaller slices tightly coupled with compute units to enhance performance and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address memory latency, bandwidth, capacity, and energy constraints, which increasingly limit system performance.

Method: The authors propose using smaller, tightly coupled memory slices with compute nodes while leveraging 2.5D/3D integration to minimize access costs and improve memory performance.

Result: The proposed architecture enables efficient data management via explicit memory capacities and distances, improving bandwidth and energy-efficiency compared to traditional DRAM-based systems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that explicitly managing memory hierarchies and breaking them into smaller, integrated units is more practical and efficient for addressing modern computing challenges.

Abstract: Memory latency, bandwidth, capacity, and energy increasingly limit
performance. In this paper, we reconsider proposed system architectures that
consist of huge (many-terabyte to petabyte scale) memories shared among large
numbers of CPUs. We argue two practical engineering challenges, scaling and
signaling, limit such designs. We propose the opposite approach. Rather than
create large, shared, homogenous memories, systems explicitly break memory up
into smaller slices more tightly coupled with compute elements. Leveraging
advances in 2.5D/3D integration, this compute-memory node provisions private
local memory, enabling accesses of node-exclusive data through micrometer-scale
distances, and dramatically reduced access cost. In-package memory elements
support shared state within a processor, providing far better bandwidth and
energy-efficiency than DRAM, which is used as main memory for large working
sets and cold data. Hardware making memory capacities and distances explicit
allows software to efficiently compose this hierarchy, managing data placement
and movement.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of efficiently integrating SHA-3 cryptographic operations as custom instructions into general-purpose processors, achieving significant performance improvements for RISC-V through both simulation and hardware prototyping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the inefficiency of SHA-3 acceleration in general-purpose processors, as existing solutions rely on standalone coprocessors or software optimizations that avoid direct microarchitectural integration.

Method: The authors prototyped SHA-3 custom instructions for RISC-V using GEM5 simulations and FPGA hardware to evaluate performance improvements and hardware utilization in terms of registers and LUTs.

Result: The study demonstrated up to 8.02x performance improvement for SHA-3 workloads and up to 46.31x for Keccak-specific workloads, with only a modest increase in hardware resources.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that embedding SHA-3 as custom instructions in general-purpose CPUs is feasible and impactful, offering important insights for microarchitectural cryptographic design.

Abstract: Integrating cryptographic accelerators into modern CPU architectures presents
unique microarchitectural challenges, particularly when extending instruction
sets with complex and multistage operations. Hardware-assisted cryptographic
instructions, such as Intel's AES-NI and ARM's custom instructions for
encryption workloads, have demonstrated substantial performance improvements.
However, efficient SHA-3 acceleration remains an open problem due to its
distinct permutation-based structure and memory access patterns. Existing
solutions primarily rely on standalone coprocessors or software optimizations,
often avoiding the complexities of direct microarchitectural integration. This
study investigates the architectural challenges of embedding a SHA-3
permutation operation as a custom instruction within a general-purpose
processor, focusing on pipelined simultaneous execution, storage utilization,
and hardware cost. In this paper, we investigated and prototyped a SHA-3 custom
instruction for the RISC-V CPU architecture. Using cycle-accurate GEM5
simulations and FPGA prototyping, our results demonstrate performance
improvements of up to 8.02x for RISC-V optimized SHA-3 software workloads and
up to 46.31x for Keccak-specific software workloads, with only a 15.09%
increase in registers and a 11.51% increase in LUT utilization. These findings
provide critical insights into the feasibility and impact of SHA-3 acceleration
at the microarchitectural level, highlighting practical design considerations
for future cryptographic instruction set extensions.

### [28] [Social Bias in Multilingual Language Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20201)
*Lance Calvin Lim Gamboa,Yue Feng,Mark Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multilingual pretrained models inherit biases seen in English models. This review discusses efforts to evaluate and mitigate these biases across diverse languages and cultures, highlighting gaps and proposing future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained models often exhibit biases, yet multilingual and non-English applications lack systematic evaluation and effective mitigation strategies.

Method: The paper conducts a systematic review of research on bias evaluation, mitigation, and benchmarks in multilingual contexts, focusing on linguistic diversity, cultural awareness, and evaluation methodologies.

Result: The survey identifies methodological gaps, such as limited language coverage and few multilingual mitigation studies, while also documenting challenges and solutions in bias adaptation.

Conclusion: Future research should prioritize inclusivity, cultural appropriateness, and alignment with modern NLP techniques to better address multilingual bias issues.

Abstract: Pretrained multilingual models exhibit the same social bias as models
processing English texts. This systematic review analyzes emerging research
that extends bias evaluation and mitigation approaches into multilingual and
non-English contexts. We examine these studies with respect to linguistic
diversity, cultural awareness, and their choice of evaluation metrics and
mitigation techniques. Our survey illuminates gaps in the field's dominant
methodological design choices (e.g., preference for certain languages, scarcity
of multilingual mitigation experiments) while cataloging common issues
encountered and solutions implemented in adapting bias benchmarks across
languages and cultures. Drawing from the implications of our findings, we chart

*Mohammad Amini,Babak Ahmadi,Xiaomeng Xiong,Yilin Zhang,Christopher Qiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates using language models for automatic generation of multiple-choice questions, comparing fine-tuned mid-sized and untuned larger models, and highlights the importance of structured prompting for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to reduce the cost and variability in manual test development by leveraging language models for automatic question generation in morphological assessment.

Method: The study used a two-fold approach: comparing a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B) with a larger untuned model (GPT-3.5, 175B) and testing seven structured prompting strategies like zero-shot and chain-of-thought. Metrics and expert evaluations were used to assess the generated items.

Result: Structured prompting significantly enhanced performance of the fine-tuned medium model (Gemma), which outperformed GPT-3.5 in creating construct-aligned and instructionally valid items. Combining certain prompting strategies was particularly effective.

Conclusion: The research showcases that midsized models can deliver high-quality results for question generation when supplemented with structured prompting and fine-tuning. This offers a practical and scalable workflow for educational assessment item development.

Abstract: This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to
create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to
reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a
two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B)
with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven
structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items
were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five
dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate
human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially
strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly
improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and
instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with
prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study
demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance
midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value
of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to
ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a
practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items
for K-12.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an open-source methodology for integrating SystemC TLM models into FMI 3.0 co-simulation workflows, resolving interoperability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of cyber-physical systems creates a need for efficient modeling and co-simulation methodologies across heterogeneous domains.

Method: SystemC TLM components are encapsulated as FMI 3.0 Co-Simulation Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) using an open-source toolchain, addressing challenges like time synchronization and data exchange.

co-simulation techniques. While SystemC Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM)
enables effective hardware/software co-design, its limited interoperability
with models from other engineering domains poses integration challenges. This
paper presents a fully open-source methodology for integrating SystemC TLM
models into Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)-based co-simulation workflows.
By encapsulating SystemC TLM components as FMI 3.0 Co Simulation Functional
Mock-up Units (FMUs), the proposed approach facilitates seamless, standardized
integration across heterogeneous simulation environments. We introduce a
lightweight open-source toolchain, address key technical challenges such as
time synchronization and data exchange, and demonstrate the feasibility and
effectiveness of the integration through representative case studies.

### [31] [Can Compact Language Models Search Like Agents? Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization for Preserving Agentic RAG Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20324)
*Rikuto Kotoge,Mai Nishimura,Jiaxin Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study presents DGPO, a method enabling compact language models to perform high-level agentic search behaviors effectively, overcoming traditional limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compact language models face challenges in agentic RAG behaviors like search and planning due to insufficient reasoning ability, sparse rewards, and unstable training.

Method: The paper introduces DGPO, which involves initializing from teacher demonstrations and providing continuous teacher guidance during policy optimization.

Result: DGPO allows compact language models to achieve advanced agentic search behaviors, sometimes even outperforming larger teacher models.

Conclusion: DGPO makes it feasible for compact models to execute agentic RAG capabilities in resource-constrained environments, showcasing their efficiency and adaptability.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit
agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models.
However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor
reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To
overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization
(DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from
teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy
optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG
Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search
coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search
behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO
makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

### [32] [GUARD: Guideline Upholding Test through Adaptive Role-play and Jailbreak Diagnostics for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20325)
*Haibo Jin,Ruoxi Chen,Peiyan Zhang,Andy Zhou,Yang Zhang,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'GUARD,' a testing method for assessing Large Language Model (LLM) compliance to ethics guidelines by generating actionable violation-testing questions and jailbreak diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can produce harmful responses, raising societal concerns and prompting guidelines for trustworthy AI, which are often not operationalized for direct testing.

Method: GUARD uses automated generation of guideline-violating questions based on government-issued ethics guidelines, combined with jailbreak diagnostics to assess safety and identify bypass scenarios.

Result: Empirical tests on seven LLMs showed GUARD's ability to assess compliance against guidelines and transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models.

Conclusion: GUARD helps ensure AI systems adhere to ethical guidelines, offering a practical tool for promoting trustworthy AI applications across different models.

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,
their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal
and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines
to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are
typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in
translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline
\textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and
Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize
guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM
adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of
guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby
testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly
violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses
that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of
``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that
provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying
potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method
finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence
and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,
including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued
guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can
transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its
usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

### [33] [Joint Enhancement of Relational Reasoning for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20351)
*Zhirui Chen,Wei Shen,Jiashui Huang,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The JERR framework enhances long-context comprehension and reasoning in large language models using graph-based techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in long-context tasks, hallucinations, and transparency in large language models.

Method: The framework uses three components: strategic text chunking for synopsis extraction, constructing directed acyclic graphs to eliminate redundancy, and integrating Monte Carlo Tree Search for efficient reasoning paths.

Result: Experimental results show JERR outperforms baselines on ROUGE, F1 metrics, and achieves top scores in the LLM-Rater evaluation.

Conclusion: JERR enhances LLMs’ reliability, transparency, and long-context reasoning capabilities, marking an improvement over current baselines.

Abstract: Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle
with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle
complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of
transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance
long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates
three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational
reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically,
allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently.
Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring
logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more
accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution
that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with
improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR
consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving
the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

*Yuyao Wang,Bowen Liu,Jianheng Tang,Nuo Chen,Yuhan Li,Qifan Zhang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces using NP-hard graph problems as a synthetic training dataset for improving Large Language Models’ (LLMs) long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) reasoning, emphasizing reasoning depth and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to find scalable alternatives to the costly and human-curated datasets currently used to develop long chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities in large language models.

Method: The approach involves two stages of post-training: (i) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NP-hard graph problems to improve reasoning depth, and (ii) reinforcement learning (RL) with specific reward designs to enhance reasoning efficiency.

Result: The proposed model, Graph-R1-7B, generalizes well across various domains such as mathematics, coding, and STEM. It outperforms QwQ-32B in both accuracy and efficiency on NP-hard graph problems.

Conclusion: NP-hard graph problems are shown to be a scalable and effective resource for enhancing the Long CoT reasoning abilities of LLMs. The study demonstrates progress in LLM post-training methodologies and presents a novel frontier in this domain.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long
chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT
behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are
typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving
scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH)
graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require
deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are
core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we
develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially
enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship
model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics,
coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both
accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as
an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs,
opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available

### [35] [CAPE: Context-Aware Personality Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20385)
*Jivnesh Sandhan,Fei Cheng,Tushar Sandhan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework to assess the behavioral traits of LLMs in realistic conversational settings by incorporating conversational history.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Psychometric tests have traditionally evaluated human behavior but are applied to LLMs in artificial, context-free scenarios ignoring real-world applications. The authors aim to address this limitation.

Method: The proposed CAPE framework integrates prior conversational interactions and develops novel metrics to quantify response consistency, aiming to emulate real-world conversational dynamics for LLM evaluation.

Result: Experiments on 7 LLMs show GPT models achieve enhanced response consistency but exhibit personality shifts, whereas other models depend more on prior interactions. Role-Playing Agents benefit from context-dependent evaluations.

Conclusion: Context-aware evaluations, as proposed in this framework, improve the alignment of LLMs with human judgment, enhance personality assessment accuracy, and highlight the impact of conversational history.

Abstract: Psychometric tests, traditionally used to assess humans, are now being
applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate their behavioral traits.
However, existing studies follow a context-free approach, answering each
question in isolation to avoid contextual influence. We term this the Disney
World test, an artificial setting that ignores real-world applications, where
conversational history shapes responses. To bridge this gap, we propose the
first Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for LLMs,
incorporating prior conversational interactions. To thoroughly analyze the
influence of context, we introduce novel metrics to quantify the consistency of
LLM responses, a fundamental trait in human behavior.
  Our exhaustive experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history
enhances response consistency via in-context learning but also induces
personality shifts, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo exhibiting extreme
deviations. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, Gemini-1.5-Flash
and Llama-8B display significant sensitivity. Moreover, GPT models response
stem from their intrinsic personality traits as well as prior interactions,
whereas Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama--8B heavily depend on prior interactions.
Finally, applying our framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) shows
context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better
align with human judgments. Our code and datasets are publicly available at:

### [36] [Measuring Reasoning Utility in LLMs via Conditional Entropy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20395)
*Xu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how assessing reasoning steps' utility can improve the accuracy of answers generated by large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how intermediate reasoning steps contribute to an LLM's final answer accuracy and to optimize reasoning by identifying and removing unproductive steps.

Method: The study uses the MATH dataset with reasoning chains generated by Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o. It employs Qwen3-8B to evaluate the utility of reasoning steps by measuring the conditional entropy at each step.

Result: Conditional entropy trends reveal that decreasing entropy predicts correct answers, while flat or rising entropy correlates with errors; incorrect reasoning paths are also generally longer.

Conclusion: Longer reasoning paths do not necessarily yield better answers, and identifying unproductive reasoning steps early could enhance reasoning efficiency and final accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating
intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has
examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness.
Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more
context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could
predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could
stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final
decision.
  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to
generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to
quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we
measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step
using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the
vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear
pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated
with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong
answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer
than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield
better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on
designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive
reasoning early.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DentalBench is introduced as a comprehensive bilingual benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in the dental domain, including a QA dataset and curated corpus for domain-specific adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of targeted evaluation resources for assessing the capabilities of large language models in specialized medical fields such as dentistry.

Method: DentalBench was introduced with two components: DentalQA (a bilingual QA benchmark) and DentalCorpus (a curated corpus). The performance of 14 LLMs was evaluated, with a focus on domain-specific adaptation strategies.

Result: Domain adaptation was shown to significantly improve LLM performance, especially in knowledge-intensive and terminology-specific tasks. Performance gaps across tasks and languages were noted.

Conclusion: Domain-specific benchmarks like DentalBench are critical for developing reliable and effective LLMs tailored for specialized medical fields.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs)
have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However,
their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which
require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack
of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the
first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs
in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an
English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions
spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale,
high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain
adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering
proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant
performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with
Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model
performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks,
and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing
trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces KG-CQR, a framework that combines knowledge graphs with language models to improve query enrichment in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in retrieval systems for complex queries, especially those relying on large language models, by enriching query contexts using structured representations from knowledge graphs.

Method: KG-CQR employs a model-agnostic pipeline of three modules—subgraph extraction, completion, and contextual generation—to enhance retrieval performance without the need for further training.

Result: KG-CQR improves retrieval performance significantly, with a 4-6% increase in mAP and a 2-3% rise in Recall@25 on standard datasets compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: Incorporating structured knowledge graph representations into RAG systems boosts retrieval effectiveness, particularly in challenging tasks like multi-hop question answering.

Abstract: The integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) with large language models (LLMs)
offers significant potential to improve the retrieval phase of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. In this study, we propose KG-CQR,
a novel framework for Contextual Query Retrieval (CQR) that enhances the
retrieval phase by enriching the contextual representation of complex input
queries using a corpus-centric KG. Unlike existing methods that primarily
address corpus-level context loss, KG-CQR focuses on query enrichment through
structured relation representations, extracting and completing relevant KG
subgraphs to generate semantically rich query contexts. Comprising subgraph
extraction, completion, and contextual generation modules, KG-CQR operates as a
model-agnostic pipeline, ensuring scalability across LLMs of varying sizes
without additional training. Experimental results on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG
datasets demonstrate KG-CQR's superior performance, achieving a 4-6%
improvement in mAP and a 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 over strong baseline
models. Furthermore, evaluations on challenging RAG tasks such as multi-hop
question answering show that, by incorporating KG-CQR, the performance
consistently outperforms the existing baseline in terms of retrieval
effectiveness

Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of specialized tools for evaluating LLMs in the civil aviation maintenance domain, an area requiring complex reasoning and domain-specific knowledge.

Method: The paper presents a benchmark for evaluating LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in civil aviation scenarios, focusing on pinpointing gaps in reasoning and domain knowledge. Experimental analyses are conducted on widely-used models.

Result: The benchmark effectively assesses model performance in civil aviation maintenance tasks and identifies areas for improvement, such as fine-tuning, optimization, and prompt engineering.

Conclusion: This benchmark provides a standardized evaluation framework to advance LLM capabilities in civil aviation maintenance. Open-sourcing the tool fosters further research and development in this niche area.

Abstract: Civil aviation maintenance is a domain characterized by stringent industry
standards. Within this field, maintenance procedures and troubleshooting
represent critical, knowledge-intensive tasks that require sophisticated
reasoning. To address the lack of specialized evaluation tools for large
language models (LLMs) in this vertical, we propose and develop an
industrial-grade benchmark specifically designed for civil aviation
maintenance. This benchmark serves a dual purpose: It provides a standardized
tool to measure LLM capabilities within civil aviation maintenance, identifying
specific gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning. By pinpointing these
deficiencies, the benchmark establishes a foundation for targeted improvement
efforts (e.g., domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized
prompt engineering), ultimately facilitating progress toward more intelligent
solutions within civil aviation maintenance. Our work addresses a significant
gap in the current LLM evaluation, which primarily focuses on mathematical and
coding reasoning tasks. In addition, given that Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems are currently the dominant solutions in practical applications ,
we leverage this benchmark to evaluate existing well-known vector embedding
models and LLMs for civil aviation maintenance scenarios. Through experimental
exploration and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in
assessing model performance within this domain, and we open-source this
evaluation benchmark and code to foster further research and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) combined with TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity to recommend practical work titles based on prior cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a system that leverages past experience to suggest practical work titles efficiently and accurately.

Method: CBR methodology is used to match cases, TF-IDF is applied for word vectorization, and Cosine Similarity is used for calculating the similarity. The system tests both predefined and randomized titles.

Result: The system was tested on 705 titles and achieved consistent results in both predefined and randomized testing, with the highest average match scores maintained.

Conclusion: The CBR system is effective for recommending practical work titles with consistent accuracy.

Abstract: Case Base Reasoning (CBR) is a case solving technique based on experience in
cases that have occurred before with the highest similarity. CBR is used to
search for practical work titles. TF-IDF is applied to process the
vectorization of each practical work title word and Cosine Similarity for the
calculation of similarity values. This system can search either in the form of
titles or keywords. The output of the system is the title of practical work and
the match value of each title. Based on the test results using 705 practical
work titles, testing was carried out with five titles and carried out in two
stages. The first stage searches with existing titles and the second stage
randomizes the title from the first stage. And the results obtained in the
second stage are the same number of titles found and the highest average match
score.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gaps in existing benchmarks that fail to evaluate LLMs' abilities to handle complex, real-world tasks involving multi-tool coordination and advanced reasoning.

Method: MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28 MCP servers with 250 tools across domains and evaluates multi-step tasks that necessitate retrieving tools, planning multi-hop execution, and interpreting intermediate outputs.

Result: The experiments on 20 advanced LLMs highlight persistent challenges in handling the tasks outlined in MCP-Bench, emphasizing the limitations of current models.

Conclusion: MCP-Bench offers a comprehensive framework for evaluating the real-world utility of LLMs, revealing areas where LLMs need improvement to handle complex, domain-spanning tasks effectively.

Abstract: We introduce MCP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) on realistic, multi-step tasks that demand tool use, cross-tool
coordination, precise parameter control, and planning/reasoning for solving
tasks. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28
representative live MCP servers spanning 250 tools across domains such as
finance, traveling, scientific computing, and academic search. Unlike prior
API-based benchmarks, each MCP server provides a set of complementary tools
designed to work together, enabling the construction of authentic, multi-step
tasks with rich input-output coupling. Tasks in MCP-Bench test agents' ability
to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names,
plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses
in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows -
capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on
explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain
operations. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework covering tool-level
schema understanding and usage, trajectory-level planning, and task completion.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances prediction accuracy and robustness, emphasizing the utility of prompt learning in processing multimodal EHRs, even under high corruption levels.

Abstract: Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic
health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient
outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches
predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical
insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information
within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce
and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing
techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource
utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR
datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with
leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key
components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained
sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the
corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world
datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved
performance metrics by 1.6\%/0.8\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction,
0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical
duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently
demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three
tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an
effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and
resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of
using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs.
Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within
structured data, especially at high corruption levels.

*Luke Bates,Max Glockner,Preslav Nakov,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConspirED, a dataset for analyzing cognitive traits of conspiratorial ideation in texts from online conspiracy articles. This helps model and assess AI vulnerabilities against conspiratorial content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the rhetorical patterns of conspiratorial content is crucial for creating effective interventions to combat misinformation, especially in light of increasingly sophisticated AI-generated conspiracy theories.

Method: The researchers created ConspirED, a dataset annotated with cognitive traits of conspiratorial thinking based on the CONSPIR cognitive framework. They used the dataset to build computational models and assess the robustness of large language/reasoning models against conspiratorial content.

Result: Computational models developed on ConspirED successfully identify and analyze conspiratorial traits in text. Large language models, however, are misaligned with such content, often mirroring conspiratorial reasoning patterns.

Conclusion: The study highlights the vulnerability of large language/reasoning models to conspiratorial content and provides an annotated dataset and tools for further research in combating misinformation.

Abstract: Conspiracy theories erode public trust in science and institutions while
resisting debunking by evolving and absorbing counter-evidence. As AI-generated
misinformation becomes increasingly sophisticated, understanding rhetorical
patterns in conspiratorial content is important for developing interventions
such as targeted prebunking and assessing AI vulnerabilities. We introduce
ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset), which captures the cognitive traits of
conspiratorial ideation in multi-sentence excerpts (80--120 words) from online
conspiracy articles, annotated using the CONSPIR cognitive framework
(Lewandowsky and Cook, 2020). ConspirED is the first dataset of conspiratorial
content annotated for general cognitive traits. Using ConspirED, we (i) develop
computational models that identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant
traits in text excerpts, and (ii) evaluate large language/reasoning model
(LLM/LRM) robustness to conspiratorial inputs. We find that both are misaligned
by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrors input reasoning
patterns, even when successfully deflecting comparable fact-checked
misinformation.

*Chihiro Taguchi,Seng Mai,Keita Kurabe,Yusuke Sakai,Georgina Agyei,Soudabeh Eslami,David Chiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques the FLORES+ MT benchmark for English-to-many translations, identifying cultural and domain-specific biases and quality issues in the dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address shortcomings in multilingual MT benchmarks and advocate for realistic and culturally-neutral evaluation methods.

Method: Analyzing translations in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, South Azerbaijani) using human assessments and testing MT models on both FLORES+ and a newly created domain-relevant evaluation set.

Result: Found that the FLORES+ benchmark translations often lack quality, are culturally biased, and are vulnerable to artificially-inflated BLEU scores from simple heuristics.

Conclusion: Multilingual MT benchmarks should prioritize domain-general, culturally-neutral sources and reduce dependency on artifacts like named entities for more accurate real-world evaluation.

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in
evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+
benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over
200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study
data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani)
and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly
multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall
below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source
sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the
English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as
copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting
vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models
trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while
achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on
these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use
domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities,
in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

### [46] [SciTopic: Enhancing Topic Discovery in Scientific Literature through Advanced LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20514)
*Pengjiang Li,Zaitian Wang,Xinhao Zhang,Ran Zhang,Lu Jiang,Pengfei Wang,Yuanchun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SciTopic, a topic discovery model leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for scientific literature analysis, achieving superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for topic discovery in scientific publications often fail to fully understand complex text relationships, requiring improved approaches.

Method: SciTopic incorporates a textual encoder to capture publication content, a space optimization module for thematic relevance guided by LLMs, and fine-tuning using contrastive loss of triplets.

Result: Experiments on three scientific datasets show SciTopic surpassing existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: SciTopic offers a powerful tool for uncovering research trends, effectively enhancing comprehension and exploration of scientific research.

Abstract: Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for
researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for
investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many
machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been
applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery
methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a
comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with
complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional
comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we
propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve
scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build
a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications,
including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space
optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks
guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual
intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the
textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the
contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better
discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments
conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate
that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic
discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

*Jiahao Xiao,Jiangming Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Explores Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in federated learning for NLP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local training data are often non-IID across clients, especially in terms of language domains, which previous studies overlooked.

Method: The paper proposes a benchmarking framework for real-world data with diverse domains and introduces AdaFD for adaptive handling of multi-domain non-IID scenarios.

Result: Experimental results show AdaFD excels in capturing local client diversity and outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: AdaFD provides a robust solution to overcome non-IID challenges in federated NLP tasks, demonstrating improved performance in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings.

Abstract: The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new
training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data
from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can
not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address
the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving
federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However,
previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label
(output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains
(input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we
introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a
unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be
used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To
this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework
designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models
capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared
to the existing works. The code for this paper is available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative framework for Query-Driven Text Summarization (QDTS), addressing limitations of traditional extractive methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance and efficiency in industrial web search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome key limitations of traditional extractive summarization models in web search such as cumulative information loss and insufficient semantic understanding of queries and documents.

Method: The study employs a novel generative framework incorporating large model distillation, supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding for domain specialization.

Result: The proposed model surpasses the production baseline, achieving state-of-the-art performance on industry-relevant metrics, and operates efficiently with 334 NVIDIA GPUs to process ~50,000 queries per second at an average latency below 55 ms.

Conclusion: Generative models can effectively address the challenges in QDTS for industrial applications, offering both superior performance and deployment efficiency.

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of large-scale web search, Query-Driven Text
Summarization (QDTS) aims to generate concise and informative summaries from
textual documents based on a given query, which is essential for improving user
engagement and facilitating rapid decision-making. Traditional extractive
summarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments,
have been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these
approaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often
introduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its
weakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding
of both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex
search intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the
application of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web
search. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised
fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to
transform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a
domain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant
metrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state
of the art. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent deployment efficiency,
requiring only 334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs to handle \textasciitilde50,000 queries per
second under 55~ms average latency per query.

*Yangfan Wang,Jie Liu,Chen Tang,Lian Yan,Jingchi Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), a method to improve multi-hop question answering by enhancing diversity and accuracy in question generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in multi-hop question answering due to data sparsity and spurious patterns learned by models.

Method: Develops the KCS framework, which uses a sentence-level conditional prediction task with probabilistic contrastive loss for knowledge selection, coupled with stochastic decoding for balanced accuracy and diversity.

Result: KCS enhances knowledge composition selection accuracy by 3.9% and shows improvements on the HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets.

Conclusion: KCS effectively diversifies and improves multi-hop question generation, providing better model performance and data augmentation techniques.

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering faces substantial challenges due to data
sparsity, which increases the likelihood of language models learning spurious
patterns. To address this issue, prior research has focused on diversifying
question generation through content planning and varied expression. However,
these approaches often emphasize generating simple questions and neglect the
integration of essential knowledge, such as relevant sentences within
documents. This paper introduces the Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), an
innovative framework designed to expand the diversity of generated multi-hop
questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a given context. KCS
models the knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional
prediction task and utilizes a probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the
next most relevant piece of knowledge. During inference, we employ a stochastic
decoding strategy to effectively balance accuracy and diversity. Compared to
competitive baselines, our KCS improves the overall accuracy of knowledge
composition selection by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation yields
improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets. Our code is available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Graph-Language Models (GLMs) exhibit limitations in effectively integrating graph and language understanding, with current benchmarks failing to test genuine multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight shortcomings in existing GLM evaluation benchmarks, which fail to test genuine multimodal reasoning by allowing strong unimodal performance.

Method: The authors propose a new benchmark, CLEGR (Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning), built using synthetic graph generation and compositional questions to assess reasoning combining structure and semantic text.

Result: Soft-prompted LLMs match full GNN-backed GLMs in performance, revealing underutilization of graph structures. Moreover, GLMs perform poorly on tasks requiring structural reasoning.

Conclusion: Current GLMs lack effective structural reasoning capabilities despite multimodal aspirations, necessitating better integrated and more capable benchmarks for progress.

Abstract: Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural
reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that
current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed
node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal
reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is
achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not
necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we
introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed
to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark
employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that
require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a
thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that
soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full
GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of
incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit
significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning.
These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of
current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward
explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of errors in domain-specific named entities transcription from speech recognition systems by proposing a method leveraging speech sound features in conjunction with a generative approach to correct errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often produce errors in domain-specific named entities transcription, which impedes downstream tasks and the development of lightweight correction models.

Method: The paper introduces a novel named entity correction model that uses speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities, combined with a generative approach to detect and replace entity errors in ASR outputs.

Result: Using open-source and custom test sets, the proposed NEC method demonstrated remarkable improvements in entity transcription accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed NEC method effectively addresses transcription errors, especially when there are significant word form differences, showing notable potential for enhancing entity accuracy in ASR systems.

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe
domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream
tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have
been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level
edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the
forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are
significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly
transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel
NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities.
With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a
generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the
text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form
difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test
sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant
improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test
set and training data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents HArch, the first multi-lingual and multi-label classification model for implicit discourse relation recognition, achieving state-of-the-art results and outperforming GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick in IDRR tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR) across languages by leveraging hierarchical dependencies and task-specific fine-tuning, addressing the limitations of existing models and prompting techniques.

Method: The authors propose HArch, a model that uses pre-trained encoder backbones and hierarchical sense dependency modeling to predict distributions across three sense levels in the PDTB 3.0 framework. They evaluate it using DiscoGeM 2.0 and compare its performance to LLMs like GPT-4o.

Result: HArch demonstrates superior performance in IDRR tasks, with RoBERTa-HArch leading in English and XLM-RoBERTa-HArch excelling in multi-lingual settings. The fine-tuned models consistently outperform GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick.

Conclusion: The hierarchical approach and task-specific fine-tuning prove highly effective for IDRR, achieving SOTA results on the DiscoGeM dataset, and the framework outperforms large language models in the domain.

Abstract: This paper introduces the first multi-lingual and multi-label classification
model for implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR). Our model, HArch, is
evaluated on the recently released DiscoGeM 2.0 corpus and leverages
hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses to predict probability
distributions across all three sense levels in the PDTB 3.0 framework. We
compare several pre-trained encoder backbones and find that RoBERTa-HArch
achieves the best performance in English, while XLM-RoBERTa-HArch performs best
in the multi-lingual setting. In addition, we compare our fine-tuned models
against GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick using few-shot prompting across all
language configurations. Our results show that our fine-tuned models
consistently outperform these LLMs, highlighting the advantages of
task-specific fine-tuning over prompting in IDRR. Finally, we report SOTA
results on the DiscoGeM 1.0 corpus, further validating the effectiveness of our
hierarchical approach.

*Ruiyi Yan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores tokenization inconsistency (TI) issues in steganography and watermarking within language models, proposing tailored methods to address them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the challenges posed by tokenization inconsistencies, which can weaken the robustness of steganography and watermarking systems.

Method: The authors identify TI's problematic tokens as infrequent and temporary, and propose stepwise verification for steganography and post-hoc rollback for watermarking to address these issues.

Result: The proposed solutions improve text steganography's fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capability, while enhancing watermarking's detectability and robustness.

Conclusion: Directly addressing TI significantly enhances the robustness and effectiveness of both steganography and watermarking systems.

Abstract: Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and
efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality
of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the
importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this
study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in
steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our
investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit
two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these
findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise
verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for
watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation
methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in
fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for
watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against
attacks.

TL;DR: The paper presents rStar2-Agent, a 14B parameter math reasoning model trained with agentic reinforcement learning. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in math reasoning tasks and demonstrates broader generalization abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to advance the state of math reasoning models by introducing autonomy in complex problem-solving, leveraging agentic reinforcement learning to achieve state-of-the-art results efficiently.

Method: The method includes the development of rStar2-Agent with three innovations: an efficient RL infrastructure, GRPO-RoC algorithm for handling noisy code environments, and a multi-stage training process starting with non-reasoning tasks. Training is performed on 64 MI300X GPUs in a cost-effective manner.

Result: rStar2-Agent achieves state-of-the-art average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing models with significantly greater parameters like DeepSeek-R1 (671B). It also demonstrates generalization to alignment and scientific reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The study concludes that efficient agentic reinforcement learning can scale math reasoning models with minimal resources, achieving high performance and generalization. The methods and results underpin the potential for broader applications of such AI models.

Abstract: We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic
reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current
long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking
carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution
feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in
complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key
innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL
infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports
high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling
training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic
RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the
inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason
more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training
recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL
stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To
this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in
only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on
AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly
shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates
strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use
tasks. Code and training recipes are available at

### [57] [Leveraging Semantic Triples for Private Document Generation with Local Differential Privacy Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20736)
*Stephen Meisenbacher,Maulik Chevli,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DP-ST, which uses semantic triples to achieve private document generation under local DP conditions, ensuring coherent text generation even at low privacy parameters (ε).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the need to address challenges in privatizing texts under local DP, where current methods require very high ε values and often struggle with generating coherent and meaningful text.

Method: The paper proposes DP-ST, leveraging semantic triples for neighborhood-aware document generation and combining it with LLM post-processing to enhance coherence and utility.

Result: DP-ST successfully generates coherent texts even at lower ε values while maintaining privacy guarantees, balancing privacy and utility in local DP implementations.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate a divide-and-conquer paradigm using semantic triples and LLMs can effectively address limitations in text privatization under local DP, enhancing both coherence and privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural
Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP
guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations
to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text
must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound
governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite
demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only
be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this
challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for
neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees.
Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and
privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with
LLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at
lower $\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility. These
findings highlight the importance of coherence in achieving balanced
privatization outputs at reasonable $\varepsilon$ levels.

*Vassiliy Cheremetiev,Quang Long Ho Ngo,Chau Ying Kot,Alina Elena Baia,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper enhances implicit hate speech (IHS) detection by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit hate speech detection is challenging due to its subtle nature, requiring innovative approaches beyond identifying explicit derogatory terms.

Method: Fine-tuning large language models (like Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed, and E5) specifically for the task of detecting implicit hate speech.

Result: Achieved up to 1.10% improvement in in-dataset and 20.35% improvement in cross-dataset evaluations (F1-macro score).

Conclusion: Fine-tuning general-purpose LLM-based embeddings significantly enhances the performance of IHS detection, offering a promising approach.

Abstract: Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or
hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to
detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To
address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with
external knowledge or additional information such as context, emotions and
sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent
general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as
Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance.
Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points
improvements for in-dataset, and up to 20.35 percentage points improvements in
cross-dataset evaluation, in terms of F1-macro score.

### [59] [GUARD: Glocal Uncertainty-Aware Robust Decoding for Effective and Efficient Open-Ended Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20757)
*Yuanhao Ding,Esteban Garces Arias,Meimingwei Li,Julian Rodemann,Matthias Aßenmacher,Danlu Chen,Gaojuan Fan,Christian Heumann,Chongsheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUARD is a new self-adaptive decoding framework for open-ended text generation that balances diversity and coherence while improving speed and reducing computation overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of balancing coherence and diversity in LLM outputs, which prior methods like contrastive search struggle with due to hyperparameter sensitivity and high computational costs.

Method: The proposed method, GUARD, uses a "Glocal" uncertainty-driven framework that combines global entropy estimates and local entropy deviations. It also introduces a token-count-based penalty for reducing computational costs.

Result: GUARD successfully balances coherence and diversity, improves generation speed, and outperforms existing methods in text quality as validated by both human and LLM evaluators.

Conclusion: GUARD is an effective and computationally efficient solution for open-ended text generation, offering a balanced trade-off between coherence and diversity with strong theoretical and practical results.

Abstract: Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence
with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding
strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is
often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We
introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances
these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven
framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy
deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We
demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates
abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy
spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To
reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective
token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that
GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while
exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced
comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and
LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at

*Xiaoyi Wang,Jiwei Zhang,Guangtao Zhang,Honglei Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates if LLM-generated therapy dialogues effectively capture emotional dynamics of real CBT sessions using a comparative analysis framework, finding notable limitations in emotional authenticity and variability in synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The use of synthetic therapy dialogues created by LLMs is growing in mental health NLP, but it remains unclear whether these artificial conversations accurately emulate the emotional complexities of real therapy.

Method: The authors used the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to compare emotional trajectories in terms of valence, arousal, and dominance dimensions between real and synthetic CBT dialogues. Both full dialogues and specific speaker roles (counselor and client) were analyzed using real transcriptions and synthetic data from the CACTUS dataset.

Result: The study found that synthetic dialogues—though fluent and structurally sound—lack the emotional variability, authentic reactivity, and regulation patterns present in real therapy sessions. Emotional arc similarity between synthetic and real speakers, particularly clients, was low.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the limitations in emotional fidelity of synthetic therapy data, pointing to challenges in leveraging LLM-generated dialogues for mental health applications. The study also provides RealCBT, a dataset of genuine CBT sessions, to aid further research.

Abstract: Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train
models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear
whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of
real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of
emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze
fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance
dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles
(counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and
synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic
dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real
conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater
emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns
of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real
and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings
underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight
the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We
introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future
research in this space.

### [61] [Turning the Spell Around: Lightweight Alignment Amplification via Rank-One Safety Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20766)
*Harethah Abu Shairah,Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud,George Turkiyyah,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fine-tuning-free technique called ROSI to improve the safety alignment of language models by permanently steering their activations toward safety refusal directions, increasing safety while preserving model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address vulnerabilities in LLMs' safety mechanisms that can be bypassed by manipulating internal representations. The goal is to develop a reliable method for amplifying safety without compromising model performance.

Method: The proposed method, Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), applies a rank-one weight modification to residual stream write matrices, steering model activations toward safety-aligned directions. The safety direction is computed using a small dataset of harmful and harmless instructions.

Result: ROSI enhances safety refusal rates while maintaining performance on standard evaluation benchmarks like MMLU and HellaSwag. It also re-aligns 'uncensored' models, proving its effectiveness as a final-stage safety enhancement.

Conclusion: Targeted weight steering through ROSI offers a cost-efficient and effective approach for improving LLM safety, serving as a useful complement to fine-tuning-based methods.

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating
internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has
demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or
removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,
we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box
method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its
activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,
fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream
write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set
of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently
increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while
preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,
HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align
'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,
demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our
results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and
potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive
fine-tuning paradigms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores identifying irrational thought patterns in online posts by Dutch adolescents to aid early mental health interventions, emphasizing domain adaptation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rising youth mental health issues require innovative solutions, including automated approaches like identifying cognitive distortions in digital text.

Method: The paper investigates cognitive distortion detection on Dutch adolescent forum posts and examines cross-lingual and cross-register generalization techniques, focusing on domain adaptation.

Result: Language and writing style shifts significantly influence performance, and domain adaptation emerges as the most effective strategy for achieving generalization.

Conclusion: Cross-lingual detection of cognitive distortions is feasible, though fine-tuning domain adaptation techniques is vital to improve accuracy.

Abstract: Rising mental health issues among youth have increased interest in automated
approaches for detecting early signs of psychological distress in digital text.
One key focus is the identification of cognitive distortions, irrational
thought patterns that have a role in aggravating mental distress. Early
detection of these distortions may enable timely, low-cost interventions. While
prior work has focused on English clinical data, we present the first in-depth
study of cross-lingual and cross-register generalization of cognitive
distortion detection, analyzing forum posts written by Dutch adolescents. Our
findings show that while changes in language and writing style can
significantly affect model performance, domain adaptation methods show the most
promise.

### [64] [GDLLM: A Global Distance-aware Modeling Approach Based on Large Language Models for Event Temporal Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20828)
*Jie Zhao,Wanting Ning,Yuxiao Fei,Yubo Feng,Lishuang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents GDLLM, a new framework combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Attention Network (GAT) to improve Event Temporal Relation Extraction (ETRE) by addressing limitations with long-distance events' dependency and minority class relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Event Temporal Relation Extraction struggle with minority class relations due to restricted pre-trained knowledge in small language models and issues with manually designed prompts in large language models.

Method: The GDLLM framework uses a graph-based structure that incorporates the capabilities of GAT to capture long-distance dependencies and introduces a temporal feature learning paradigm to enhance inference around short-distance event relations.

Result: Experiments conducted on TB-Dense and MATRES datasets show that the GDLLM approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively improving the recognition of minority relation classes.

Conclusion: The GDLLM framework significantly enhances ETRE performance by leveraging a combination of distance-aware graph modeling and augmented temporal feature learning, addressing limitations of prior approaches and setting new SOTA standards.

Abstract: In Natural Language Processing(NLP), Event Temporal Relation Extraction
(ETRE) is to recognize the temporal relations of two events. Prior studies have
noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted
pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to
handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For
Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or
instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the
model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address
these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based
on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph
Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency
features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on
soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance
proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by
LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be
captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of
minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability.
Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES,
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

*Rohan Phanse,Yijie Zhou,Kejian Shi,Wencai Zhang,Yixin Liu,Yilun Zhao,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces benchmarks to evaluate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems' ability to integrate information from multiple sources and produce long-form responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need for RAG systems to handle queries where information is distributed across multiple sources and requires synthesis into long-form outputs.

Method: The authors propose a scalable framework to build evaluation benchmarks for RAG systems, creating tasks focused on multi-source retrieval and synthesis called MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet.

Result: Experiments show that the effectiveness of generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval. Reasoning-enhanced models outperform standard LLMs in synthesizing information after retrieval.

Conclusion: Multi-source synthesis remains challenging, but improved retrieval systems and reasoning models offer promising advancements in handling multi-source, narrative, and summarization tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in settings where
information required to answer the query can be found within a single source or
the answer is short-form or factoid-based. However, many real-world
applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information
scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to
respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a
RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation
component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We
present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that
challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and
generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks
on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing
narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require
retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG
pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs
-- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval
effectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis
proves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning
models significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step.

*Benjamin Marie,Atsushi Fujita*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates post-training quantization (PTQ) methods for multilingual LLMs on machine translation across 55 languages, focusing on 4-bit and 2-bit settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how quantization affects multilingual LLMs' performance, particularly in machine translation tasks involving diverse and low-resource languages.

Method: The authors conducted experiments using five LLMs (1.7B to 70B parameters), four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, AutoRound), and evaluated interactions with decoding hyperparameters and calibration languages.

Result: 4-bit quantization generally preserves translation quality for high-resource languages. However, significant degradation occurs in low-resource and typologically diverse languages, especially with 2-bit quantization. GGUF is the most consistent quantization method.

Conclusion: Quantization impacts translation performance differently across languages. The paper offers insights to improve low-bit quantization in multilingual LLMs, particularly in low-resource language settings.

Abstract: Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks
remain underexplored. We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of
post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages
using five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that
while 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource
languages and large models, significant degradation occurs for low-resource and
typologically diverse languages, particularly in 2-bit settings. We compare
four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing
that algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF
variants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision.
Additionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding
hyperparameters, and calibration languages, finding that language-matched
calibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Our findings offer
actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs for machine translation
under quantization constraints, especially in low-resource settings.

TL;DR: This study introduces SageLM, an innovative model enhancing evaluation of speech-to-speech large language models by considering semantic and acoustic dimensions, alongside explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating end-to-end spoken dialogue systems remains challenging, as traditional methods often ignore acoustic features and may lack explainability.

Method: SageLM combines semantic and acoustic analysis, incorporates rationale-based supervision for explainable learning, and employs a two-stage training approach to counter limited speech preference datasets.

Result: SageLM achieved an 82.79% agreement rate with human evaluators, significantly surpassing existing cascaded and speech language model baselines by 7.42%–26.20%.

Conclusion: SageLM's approach provides a benchmark for effective and explainable evaluations of S2S LLMs, addressing both semantic and acoustic dimensions effectively.

Abstract: Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling end-to-end spoken dialogue
systems. However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We
propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech
LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches
that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and
acoustic dimensions. Second, it leverages rationale-based supervision to
enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment
with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods.
Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset,
and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech
preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM
achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming
cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistencies in reasoning, adherence to domain-specific policies, and information extraction in dynamic, multi-turn conversational environments for large language model agents.

Method: Manual analysis of errors in conversation trajectories, experimenting with input reformulations, and developing the IRMA framework to augment user queries with domain rules and tool suggestions.

Result: IRMA outperformed other methods like ReAct, Function Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in pass^5 scores.

Conclusion: The IRMA framework offers superior reliability and performance for LLM-based autonomous agents in dynamic and complex environments, improving their reasoning and tool use.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool
use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments
like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning,
adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over
a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these
failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors
occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with
reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent
decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA)
framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with
relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus
on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function
Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in
overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and
consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.

*Jiaqian Li,Qisheng Hu,Jing Li,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a structure-aware exemplar selection method for improving in-context learning (ICL) in LLMs, especially for semantic parsing tasks, by employing a two-stage retriever approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing exemplar selection strategies for ICL fail to account for structural alignment, leading to suboptimal performance in structured prediction tasks like semantic parsing.

Method: Proposes a two-stage process: (1) fine-tuning a BERT-based retriever with structure-aware supervision for exemplar selection, and (2) enhancing it with a plug-in module to amplify syntactic information efficiently.

Result: The method outperforms existing baselines on four semantic parsing benchmarks using multiple recent LLMs as inference models.

Conclusion: The proposed structure-aware exemplar selection enhances the generalizability and performance of ICL on structured prediction tasks, with minimal overhead and seamless integration into existing pipelines.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a powerful paradigm that enables LLMs to
perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the
effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In
particular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing
ICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to
suboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong
balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we
fine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it
to select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally
aligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies
syntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This
plug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning
three semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limited evaluations of proactive dialogue in LLMs, especially outside of domain-specific or task-focused scenarios.

Method: Propose ProactiveEval framework to evaluate LLMs on proactive dialogue by creating metrics for target planning and dialogue guidance. Developed 328 evaluation environments spanning 6 domains and tested 22 LLMs.

Result: DeepSeek-R1 excelled in target planning tasks, while Claude-3.7-Sonnet performed best in dialogue guidance. Insights on reasoning capabilities' influence on proactive behaviors.

Conclusion: The study provides a unified evaluation approach, showing the strengths and gaps of LLMs in proactive dialogue and paving the way for future model improvements.

Abstract: Proactive dialogue has emerged as a critical and challenging research problem
in advancing large language models (LLMs). Existing works predominantly focus
on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, which leads to fragmented
evaluations and limits the comprehensive exploration of models' proactive
conversation abilities. In this work, we propose ProactiveEval, a unified
framework designed for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs. This
framework decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue
guidance, establishing evaluation metrics across various domains. Moreover, it
also enables the automatic generation of diverse and challenging evaluation
data. Based on the proposed framework, we develop 328 evaluation environments
spanning 6 distinct domains. Through experiments with 22 different types of
LLMs, we show that DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit exceptional
performance on target planning and dialogue guidance tasks, respectively.
Finally, we investigate how reasoning capabilities influence proactive
behaviors and discuss their implications for future model development.

*Chen Chen,Yuchen Sun,Jiaxin Gao,Xueluan Gong,Qian Wang,Ziyao Wang,Yongsen Zheng,Kwok-Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces LETHE, a method to defend large language models (LLMs) against backdoor attacks by diluting malicious influences through internal and external mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs, while powerful, are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, and existing defenses lack comprehensiveness or fail in advanced scenarios such as multi-trigger and triggerless attacks.

Method: LETHE uses an internal mechanism that trains and merges a clean model to dilute backdoor impacts, and an external mechanism that incorporates benign evidence into prompts to distract the model from backdoor triggers.

Result: LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defenses across 5 LLMs, reducing attack success rates by up to 98% while preserving the models' utility.

Conclusion: LETHE provides an effective, cost-efficient, and robust solution to mitigate sophisticated backdoor attacks in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving
superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave
normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended
output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either
lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only
mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like
model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we
present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through
knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally,
LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then
merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting
the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE
incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to
distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on
classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate
that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor
attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by
up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be
cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.

Motivation: To enable SMEs with limited resources and NLP expertise to leverage RAG systems for addressing shortcomings of LLMs, such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge.

Method: The EASI-RAG method was designed using method engineering principles, incorporating structured roles, activities, and techniques, and validated through a case study implementation.

Result: The deployment of the RAG tool in an SME showed successful fast implementation, high user adoption, improved query response accuracy, and enhanced data reliability.

Conclusion: EASI-RAG demonstrates feasibility and effectiveness for RAG deployment in SMEs, with potential for broader applications and improvements through fine-tuning.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful solution to
mitigate the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
hallucinations and outdated knowledge. However, deploying RAG-based tools in
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) remains a challenge due to their limited
resources and lack of expertise in natural language processing (NLP). This
paper introduces EASI-RAG, Enterprise Application Support for Industrial RAG, a
structured, agile method designed to facilitate the deployment of RAG systems
in industrial SME contexts. EASI-RAG is based on method engineering principles
and comprises well-defined roles, activities, and techniques. The method was
validated through a real-world case study in an environmental testing
laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operators queries using
data extracted from operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a
month by a team with no prior RAG experience and was later iteratively improved
based on user feedback. Results demonstrate that EASI-RAG supports fast
implementation, high user adoption, delivers accurate answers, and enhances the
reliability of underlying data. This work highlights the potential of RAG
deployment in industrial SMEs. Future works include the need for generalization
across diverse use cases and further integration with fine-tuned models.

### [73] [Re-Representation in Sentential Relation Extraction with Sequence Routing Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21049)
*Ramazan Ali Bahrami,Ramin Yahyapour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dynamic routing approach in capsules for sentence-level relation extraction, achieving state-of-the-art results on various datasets but highlights challenges with noisy labels and discusses a concept called re-representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sentence-level relation extraction, which is integral to NLP tasks, by leveraging dynamic routing in capsule networks.

Method: The paper employs dynamic routing in capsule networks for relation extraction and analyzes performance across different datasets, highlighting advantages and challenges.

Result: The method surpasses state-of-the-art benchmarks on Tacred, Tacredrev, Retacred, and Conll04 datasets but encounters performance issues with the noisy Wikidata dataset.

Conclusion: Re-representation plays a vital role in the performance of relation extraction models, but noise in distant supervision datasets like Wikidata requires further attention as an open challenge.

Abstract: Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language
processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic
routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state
of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev,
Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good
performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another
similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise
in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance.
Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better
re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of
representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As
example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison
time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head
terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our
observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than
the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the
distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge
in sentential RE.

### [74] [Enabling Equitable Access to Trustworthy Financial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21051)
*William Jurayj,Nils Holzenberger,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper discusses an approach integrating large language models (LLMs) with symbolic solvers for accurate tax obligation calculations, significantly lowering costs and errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tax filing is a complex task often prone to errors, requiring a system that delivers high accuracy, transparency, and affordability.

Method: Integrating LLMs with symbolic solvers and using formal logic programs alongside exemplar retrieval to streamline tax calculations.

Result: The proposed system surpassed real-world averages in performance and reduced costs using the StAtutory Reasoning Assessment dataset for evaluation.

Conclusion: Neuro-symbolic architectures are effective for providing reliable, equitable, and cost-efficient tax filing assistance.

Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average
American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the
U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of
overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly
penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability,
making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We
propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate
tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging
StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for
estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties
for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of
plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently
retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve
performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages.
Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic
architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.

### [75] [Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs via Object-aware Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20181)
*Alberto Compagnoni,Davide Caffagni,Nicholas Moratelli,Lorenzo Baraldi,Marcella Cornia,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the hallucination issue in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) using a novel method called CHAIR-DPO, which aligns MLLMs to reduce hallucinations without requiring complicated pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve the prevalent problem of hallucinations in MLLMs, which undermines their reliability despite strong performance in many tasks.

Method: The study uses the CHAIR metric to create a reward signal, distinguishing between hallucinated and non-hallucinated answers. It then applies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune off-the-shelf MLLMs without relying on proprietary systems or complex pipelines.

Result: The CHAIR-DPO method significantly reduces hallucination in MLLMs, as evidenced by improvements on multiple hallucination benchmarks.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning MLLMs with CHAIR-DPO proves to be an effective approach to address the hallucination issue, and the work provides publicly available resources for further research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

### [76] [SDiFL: Stable Diffusion-Driven Framework for Image Forgery Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20182)
*Yang Su,Shunquan Tan,Jiwu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper integrates Stable Diffusion's multi-modal capabilities into an image forensic framework for improved image forgery localization, demonstrating significant performance improvements on various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The evolving image manipulation technologies, driven by tools like Stable Diffusion, present challenges in image forensics. Current forgery localization methods rely heavily on annotated data, which is costly and labor-intensive, creating the need for more advanced approaches.

Method: The authors propose a novel framework using Stable Diffusion V3 (SD3) by conditioning its multi-modal architecture on forgery-related information and treating high-frequency image forgery residuals as an explicit modality. This modality is integrated into the latent space during training to enhance detection performance, while retaining SD3's semantic understanding of images.

Result: The framework shows up to 12% improvement in performance on standard benchmarking datasets compared to state-of-the-art models. It also performs well on unseen challenges like real-world document forgery and natural scene forgeries.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of leveraging multi-modal large model architectures, like SD3, in image forensics, delivering more efficient and accurate results while maintaining strong generalization capabilities for unseen data.

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

*Max Torop,Masih Eskandar,Nicholas Kurtansky,Jinyang Liu,Jochen Weber,Octavia Camps,Veronica Rotemberg,Jennifer Dy,Kivanc Kose*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates combining Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage to enhance interpretability in skin disease diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the interpretability of AI models for diagnosing skin diseases is critical before deploying them in clinical practice.

Method: Fine-tuning MLLMs to ground their embedding spaces in quantitative lesion-related attributes using the SLICE-3D dataset.

Result: Demonstrates the feasibility of grounding MLLM embedding spaces in quantitative attributes, validated through an attribute-specific image retrieval case study.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for improving interpretability in AI-assisted skin disease diagnostics, supporting better reasoning and diagnosis.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

### [78] [Enhancing Automatic Modulation Recognition With a Reconstruction-Driven Vision Transformer Under Limited Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20193)
*Hossein Ahmadi,Banafsheh Saffari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops a Vision Transformer-based framework for automatic modulation recognition, achieving label-efficient pretraining by integrating supervised and self-supervised learning objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AMR solutions require large labeled datasets or complex multi-stage training processes, which hinder scalability and practical application. This paper aims to address these limitations by creating a framework that works effectively with limited labels.

Method: The authors propose a unified framework combining a ViT encoder, lightweight convolutional decoder, and linear classifier. It incorporates supervised and self-supervised learning, with augmented signals reconstructed to anchor features to fine-grained IQ structure.

Result: The framework outperformed traditional CNN and ViT approaches in low-label scenarios, achieved accuracy close to ResNet using only 15-20% labeled data, and showed robustness across varying SNR levels on the RML2018.01A dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed solution is generalizable, simple, and effective in label-scarce environments, making it suitable for automatic modulation recognition while maintaining high performance levels.

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

*Xiaodi Li,Pan Xie,Yi Ren,Qijun Gan,Chen Zhang,Fangyuan Kong,Xiang Yin,Bingyue Peng,Zehuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfinityHuman is a framework for generating high-resolution, long-duration animated human videos synchronized to audio, addressing issues like identity drift, hand motion realism, and lip synchronization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio-driven human animation methods face challenges in generating high-quality, extended videos without issues like identity drift or distorted hand motions.

Method: The paper introduces a coarse-to-fine framework using pose-guided refinement and hand-specific reward mechanisms to generate audio-synchronized, high-resolution animations.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that InfinityHuman outperforms existing methods in metrics such as video quality, appearance consistency, and synchronization accuracy.

Conclusion: InfinityHuman resolves key challenges in audio-driven human animation, confirming the framework's modules' effectiveness and offering state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

### [80] [Spherical Vision Transformers for Audio-Visual Saliency Prediction in 360-Degree Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20221)
*Mert Cokelek,Halit Ozsoy,Nevrez Imamoglu,Cagri Ozcinar,Inci Ayhan,Erkut Erdem,Aykut Erdem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses 360-degree video saliency prediction by introducing a new dataset (YT360-EyeTracking) and two novel models (SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV), incorporating spherical geometry and spatial audio. The models outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the absence of comprehensive datasets for saliency prediction in 360-degree environments and the need to account for the impact of spatial audio.

Method: The authors curated a new dataset, YT360-EyeTracking, and developed two saliency prediction models: SalViT360 (vision-transformer-based with spherical-awareness) and SalViT360-AV (extended with audio-conditioned transformer adapters).

Result: The proposed models (SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV) achieved state-of-the-art performance in visual saliency prediction across multiple benchmark datasets, including the newly introduced YT360-EyeTracking.

Conclusion: Integrating spatial audio in saliency prediction models significantly improves the accuracy of predicting viewer attention in 360-degree videos. The new dataset and models provide valuable tools for future research.

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at

*Phu-Vinh Nguyen,Tan-Hanh Pham,Chris Ngo,Truong Son Hy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pipeline combining Vision-Language Models and explainable AI (xAI) to explain vision models both on single samples and large datasets, addressing the underexplored area of general behavior analysis and bias identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision model development emphasizes performance over explainability, with limited focus on understanding general model behaviors across datasets, which is crucial for bias detection and pattern identification.

Method: The paper proposes a pipeline leveraging Vision-Language Models to analyze vision models at both individual sample and dataset levels, promoting minimal-effort xAI integration.

Result: The pipeline facilitates the discovery of failure cases and provides insights into the trends and biases of vision models, enhancing their development through explainability.

Conclusion: By integrating xAI analysis into vision model workflows, the proposed pipeline contributes to better, more transparent image analysis while identifying areas for model improvement.

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

TL;DR: ATMS-KD, a novel framework combining adaptive temperature and mixed-sample knowledge distillation, achieves state-of-the-art results for lightweight CNNs in agriculture with high accuracy and low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop lightweight CNN models capable of efficient and accurate predictions in resource-constrained agricultural environments.

Method: The proposed ATMS-KD framework employs adaptive temperature scheduling and mixed-sample augmentation to transfer knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model to three lightweight residual CNN student models.

Result: The students achieved validation accuracies over 96.7% on classifying Damask rose maturity, surpassing existing methods, and the compact model achieved 97.11% accuracy with the lowest inference latency of 72.19 ms.

Conclusion: ATMS-KD effectively enhances knowledge distillation performance, enabling lightweight models to achieve high accuracy and efficiency in agricultural computer vision tasks.

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study presents a novel framework for qualifying advanced materials in manufacturing by combining microstructure informatics with customized vision-language representations, enabling zero-shot classification and improved traceability without retraining models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for more efficient and reliable qualification of advanced materials produced through non-conventional additive manufacturing processes, which often involve heterogeneous structures, serves as the driving force.

Method: The paper integrates deep semantic segmentation with pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), creating shared vision-language representations. Customized similarity-based methods are used for zero-shot classification of microstructures based on positive and negative references.

Result: The method showed high accuracy in distinguishing acceptable from defective samples in metal matrix composites, with FLAVA excelling in visual sensitivity and CLIP aligning better with textual criteria.

Conclusion: This work advances semantic interoperability between raw data and expert knowledge, resulting in traceable and scalable material qualification frameworks that allow for human-in-the-loop decisions without requiring task-specific model retraining.

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

Shultz,David K. Wright,Dexiao Kong,Sharon L. Naismith,Terence J. O'Brien,Ying Xia,Meng Law,Benjamin Sinclair*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study focuses on automated segmentation of perivascular spaces (PVS) in the brain using deep learning, evaluating the performance of MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired network, across diverse MRI datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual segmentation of PVS is time-intensive and prone to moderate inter-rater variability, while existing automated methods lack generalizability to diverse datasets.

Method: The authors used a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network called MedNeXt-L-k5. They trained the model on homogeneous (200 T2-weighted scans) and heterogeneous (40 T1-weighted scans) MRI datasets, evaluating performance using cross-validation techniques such as 5-fold cross-validation and leave-one-site-out cross-validation.

Result: For the homogeneous T2-weighted dataset, the model achieved high voxel-level Dice scores of 0.88±0.06, comparable to inter-rater reliability. Performance was lower for T1-weighted and heterogeneous datasets, with Dice scores ranging from 0.35 to 0.62 depending on the metric. The model did not outperform nnU-Net.

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5 offers an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation across various MRI datasets but lacks performance superiority over nnU-Net. Transformer-based attention mechanisms were deemed unnecessary for achieving high segmentation accuracy in this context.

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

*Zhixiang Chi,Yanan Wu,Li Gu,Huan Liu,Ziqiang Wang,Yang Zhang,Yang Wang,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework that improves CLIP's open-vocabulary segmentation by adapting output predictions back to its intermediate attention, enhancing spatial coherence and semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP has strong visual-textual alignment but struggles with open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor spatial localization and semantic discrepancy in intermediate attention.

Method: The framework utilizes feedback-driven, training-free adaptation to align output-based patch-level correspondences with intermediate attention through modules like attention isolation, sparse pruning, and adaptation ensemble.

Result: The proposed method improves the performance of state-of-the-art approaches using three backbones and multiple attention types across eight benchmarks.

Conclusion: Using the model's output as a spatial coherence prior enhances semantic consistency and integrates seamlessly into existing architectures to boost performance.

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We

*Zhuoran Yu,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probing framework to analyze how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process visual and textual inputs layer by layer. It finds a consistent stage-wise structure in their processing dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the internal processing dynamics of MLLMs, which have shown strong performance but remain underexplored in terms of how they integrate visual and textual information across layers.

Method: The study uses a probing framework with linear classifiers to analyze token embeddings layer by layer, employing controlled prompt variations such as lexical, semantic negations, and output format changes to evaluate functional roles of different layers.

Result: The analysis reveals a stage-wise structure where early layers handle visual grounding, middle layers focus on lexical and semantic reasoning, and final layers prepare task-specific outputs. Layer allocation varies with changes in base language model architectures.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into the layered processing dynamics of MLLMs and offers a model-agnostic framework for analyzing multimodal representation dynamics, showing that while overall structural roles are stable, specific layers’ functions shift with architectural changes.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

*Zhi Li,Hau Phan,Matthew Emigh,Austin J. Brockmeier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel supervised dictionary learning technique to disentangle embeddings in vision-language models into concept-specific vectors, improving multi-label classification and concept-filtered image retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the semantic granularity and utilization of latent embedding spaces in vision-language models for downstream tasks like multi-label classification and conditional image retrieval.

Method: A supervised dictionary learning approach is proposed, utilizing sparse and non-negative combinations of grouped vectors (atoms) in a dictionary to match multi-label information, optimized through alternating optimization.

Result: Disentangled embeddings using sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS) show improved precision in concept-filtered image retrieval for models like CLIP, TiTok, and DINOv2, with qualitative and quantitative validation.

Conclusion: The SLiCS approach successfully decomposes embeddings into concept-specific subspaces, proving effective in enhancing image retrieval and other embedding tasks by incorporating semantic filtering.

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address security concerns like PHI exposure and cyberthreats associated with medical VLMs, while creating an accessible toolkit enabling secure integration in clinical and research settings.

Method: MedFoundationHub utilizes a graphical user interface to simplify model selection and deployment for non-expert users, integrates Hugging Face models, and ensures privacy-preserving inference using Docker orchestration on offline setups.

Result: Board-certified pathologists evaluated five VLMs on medical cases, creating 1015 clinician-model scoring events. Despite the toolkit's capabilities, issues like vague reasoning and inconsistent terminology in the models were identified.

Conclusion: MedFoundationHub enhances the accessibility and security of deploying medical VLMs while revealing critical areas for model improvement, providing a foundation to tackle cybersecurity and usability gaps in medical AI.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM) for efficient and effective multi-task dense prediction, employing novel scanning mechanisms that improve cross-task interaction with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the trade-off between interaction completeness and computational efficiency in multi-task dense prediction.

Method: The method introduces the Bidirectional Interaction Scan (BI-Scan) and Multi-Scale Scan (MS-Scan) mechanisms for task-specific and multi-granularity scene modeling within a linear complexity framework.

Result: Experiments on NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context benchmarks demonstrate superior performance of BIM compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The BIM design efficiently enhances cross-task interactions with lower computational complexity, offering a promising solution for multi-task dense prediction challenges.

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

*Hyeonyu Kim,Seokhoon Jeong,Seonghee Han,Chanhyuk Choi,Taehwan Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an audio-guided visual editing framework leveraging pre-trained multi-modal encoders for complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Textual guidance alone often fails for complex visual editing tasks, necessitating additional non-text prompts like audio.

Method: The authors use a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with zero-shot capabilities, implement noise branching, and adaptive patch selection to bridge gaps between audio and visual spaces.

Result: Experiments validate the framework's effectiveness in handling complex editing scenarios by integrating audio where text-only approaches fail.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully incorporates audio for improved visual editing, handling cases unsolvable by text alone.

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents novel methods for multi-label learning using partially annotated datasets, introducing a loss function (GPR Loss) and a pseudo-labeling technique (DAMP) that improve classification accuracy with limited annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the challenge of multi-label learning where datasets are partially annotated, specifically addressing the Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML) scenario where images have only one positive label.

Method: The authors propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss) to handle noise from pseudo-labels and introduce a Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique, forming the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling (AEVLP) framework.

Result: The framework shows state-of-the-art performance in multi-label classification across four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed AEVLP framework successfully addresses the challenges of SPML by leveraging novel loss functions and pseudo-labeling methods, setting a new standard in multi-label classification.

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel neuron architecture for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to improve performance in visual detection tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results with ultra-low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the suboptimal performance of ANN-SNN conversion methods in visual detection tasks and improve their capabilities beyond just classification.

Method: The authors propose a delay-spike approach to handle residual membrane potential and introduce a temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture that adapts firing behavior based on time-step order, enhancing temporal spike properties.

Result: The tdIF neuron enabled SNNs to achieve precise feature representation and high performance with ultra-low latency (within 5 time-steps) in object and lane line detection tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed tdIF neuron architecture significantly improves the performance of SNNs in visual detection tasks while keeping energy consumption low, outperforming current ANN-SNN conversion methods.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DUP-MCRNet, a model that enhances salient object detection in complex scenes by addressing detail loss, edge blurring, and poor modality fusion, achieving better performance than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenges of detail loss, edge blurring, and inadequate fusion of single-modal information in current SOD methods, particularly in complex visual scenarios.

Method: The approach involves the creation of a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module for small structures and edge detection, a multimodal collaborative fusion strategy for integrating modality-specific information, and training mechanisms optimized via multi-scale loss and uncertainty-guided supervision.

Result: The proposed DUP-MCRNet achieves state-of-the-art results, particularly excelling in edge clarity and the handling of complex backgrounds, as validated on common SOD benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet effectively addresses the identified issues in SOD tasks, emphasizing edge precision and multimodal collaboration, and demonstrates robustness across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

*Taiga Yamane,Satoshi Suzuki,Ryo Masumura,Shota Orihashi,Tomohiro Tanaka,Mana Ihori,Naoki Makishima,Naotaka Kawata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents MSMVD, a novel method for multi-view pedestrian detection (MVPD) that uses multi-scale BEV features to improve detection accuracy and outperforms prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MVPD methods struggle with detecting pedestrians of varying scales in multi-view settings because they do not utilize multi-scale image features effectively.

Method: The proposed method, MSMVD, generates multi-scale BEV features by projecting image features from different scales and views into BEV space, followed by feature fusion using a feature pyramid network.

Result: MSMVD significantly improves detection performance and achieves a new state-of-the-art with a 4.5-point increase in MODA on the GMVD dataset.

Conclusion: Leveraging multi-scale features in MVPD helps detect pedestrians of varying scales more accurately, making MSMVD an effective approach for this task.

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SFMFNet, a lightweight, real-time deepfake detection system focusing on spatial-frequency fusion and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detectors, while accurate, are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time use in practical scenarios.

Method: The proposed SFMFNet utilizes a spatial-frequency hybrid aware module, token-selective cross attention, and residual-enhanced blur pooling for efficient and sensitive deepfake detection.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that SFMFNet achieves a good trade-off between detection accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: SFMFNet offers strong generalization, making it a promising solution for real-time deepfake detection across practical applications.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a medical image classification technique that merges dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation for computational efficiency and robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large-scale medical image classification models demand high computational resources, posing challenges in practical applications where lightweight and efficient models are needed.

Method: The authors employ a dual-model weight selection approach to initialize two lightweight models using weights from a large pretrained model, followed by applying self-knowledge distillation and fine-tuning for classification tasks.

Result: Experimental evaluation on public datasets, including chest X-rays, lung CT scans, and brain MRI, shows superior performance and robustness of the proposed method over conventional techniques.

Conclusion: Combining dual-model weight selection and self-knowledge distillation offers a promising solution for efficient, high-performance medical image classification, addressing current limitations in lightweight model design.

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework for LiDAR point cloud compression, aiming at improving context modeling and coding speed using compact features and efficient modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-precision LiDAR scans cause substantial storage and transmission challenges due to their overhead and extreme sparsity of geometric details.

Method: Two lightweight modules are introduced: the Geometry Re-Densification Module for handling sparse geometry and extracting/re-sparsifying features, and the Cross-scale Feature Propagation Module for guiding hierarchical feature propagation across resolutions.

Result: Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art compression ratios and achieved real-time encoding and decoding speeds of 26 FPS at 12-bit quantization.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully achieves efficient predictive coding of LiDAR point clouds, balancing compression performance and real-time processing speed.

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces Droplet3D, a method using video data to overcome 3D asset generation challenges due to limited native 3D data sources, and validates its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the data scarcity issue in 3D asset generation using abundant video data with commonsense priors.

Method: Develop Droplet3D-4M, a large-scale video dataset, and train a generative model, Droplet3D, capable of processing multi-view video data along with image and text inputs.

Result: Experiments show Droplet3D's ability to generate spatially consistent and semantically plausible 3D assets, with potential scalability to scene-level applications.

Conclusion: Utilizing video-based commonsense priors proves effective for 3D creation, positioning Droplet3D as a versatile and extendable solution for 3D asset generation challenges.

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have

mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip
connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model
performance.

*Jiusi Li,Jackson Jiang,Jinyu Miao,Miao Long,Tuopu Wen,Peijin Jia,Shengxiang Liu,Chunlei Yu,Maolin Liu,Yuzhan Cai,Kun Jiang,Mengmeng Yang,Diange Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces G^2Editor, a tool for realistic and precise object editing in autonomous driving videos, improving pose control and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems require diverse training scenarios, but capturing edge cases is expensive and risky.

Method: The framework uses 3D Gaussian representations injected into denoising processes and employs 3D bounding box layouts for spatial reconstruction, along with hierarchical fine-grained features for details.

Result: G^2Editor excels in object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within driving video data, achieving better pose accuracy and visual realism compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The G^2Editor demonstrates the ability to create data for autonomous driving systems efficiently and improves both upstream modeling and downstream applications.

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

### [101] [Enhancing Corpus Callosum Segmentation in Fetal MRI via Pathology-Informed Domain Randomization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20475)
*Marina Grifell i Plana,Vladyslav Zalevskyi,Léa Schmidt,Yvan Gomez,Thomas Sanchez,Vincent Dunet,Mériam Koob,Vanessa Siffredi,Meritxell Bach Cuadra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to improve fetal brain segmentation for detecting corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD) using pathology-informed domain randomization to generate synthetic data that doesn't require pathological annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of the fetal brain is critical for neurodevelopmental analysis, but CCD's rarity limits the availability of annotated pathological data, hindering AI-based diagnostic model performance.

Method: The authors propose a data augmentation technique that integrates CCD-specific anatomical variations into a synthetic data generator, enabling robust deep learning-based segmentation using only healthy data.

Result: The method improved corpus callosum length estimation errors from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm for CCD cases and maintained performance for healthy and other pathologies while providing better topological segmentation consistency.

Conclusion: Integrating domain-specific anatomical knowledge into synthetic data generation enhances segmentation accuracy and biomarker reliability in rare conditions like CCD, mitigating data scarcity challenges.

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Modular pipelines in autonomous vehicle perception face challenges like error accumulation. Unified perception integrates tasks (detection, tracking, prediction) for improved efficiency and robustness. This survey proposes taxonomy and reviews existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicle perception suffers from inefficiencies and errors in modular pipelines. Unified perception aims to provide better synergy and efficiency across detection, tracking, and prediction tasks.

Method: The survey develops a taxonomy for unified perception, categorizes methods across different paradigms, reviews architectures, training strategies, datasets, and open-source tools, aiming to organize fragmented research efforts.

Result: The paper introduces a holistic taxonomy, defines paradigms (Early, Late, Full Unified Perception), and systematizes the study of unified perception methods, consolidating prior fragmented works.

Conclusion: This survey is the first comprehensive framework for unified perception in autonomous vehicles, offering insights into improving robustness, generalizability, and interpretability, along with guiding future research directions.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

*Jeong Hun Yeo,Hyeongseop Rha,Sungjune Park,Junil Won,Yong Man Ro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified framework integrating sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance and showcasing modality synergies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of accessible Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems for the deaf and hard of hearing by developing a unified solution for diverse communication modalities.

Method: The authors propose a unified modality-agnostic architecture that processes combinations of sign language, lip movements, and audio. They focus on exploring the synergy between modalities, particularly leveraging lip movements as cues for sign language.

Result: The framework matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models in Sign Language Translation (SLT), Visual Speech Recognition (VSR), ASR, and Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR). Explicitly modeling lip movements improves SLT results.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of unifying different communication modalities and highlights the critical role of non-manual cues, such as lip movements, in enhancing sign language comprehension.

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

TL;DR: COMETH is a real-time, lightweight algorithm for multi-view human pose estimation that integrates kinematic constraints, convex optimization inverse kinematics, and a state observer for temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring human activity in Industry 5.0 requires accurate pose estimation to ensure safety and well-being, but existing solutions face scalability and computational challenges.

Method: The paper proposes COMETH, a lightweight algorithm combining kinematic constraints, convex optimization-based spatial fusion, and temporal consistency via a state observer.

Result: COMETH outperforms state-of-the-art methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy on public and industrial datasets.

Conclusion: COMETH provides an effective solution for scalable and accurate human motion tracking, suitable for industrial and critical applications, with code publicly available for use.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is

*Yuan Xie,Tianshui Chen,Zheng Ge,Lionel Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Video-MTR, a framework for multi-turn reasoning to enhance long-form video understanding, outperforming traditional static methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in long-form video understanding, which involve complex temporal dependencies and multi-event scenarios.

Method: The proposed method, Video-MTR, uses iterative reasoning over video segments with a gated bi-level reward system for end-to-end training.

Result: Experiments show Video-MTR surpasses existing benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU, and EgoSchema in accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: Video-MTR provides an advanced solution for long video understanding, eliminating the need for external visual-language models.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

*Zixuan Hu,Dongxiao Li,Xinzhu Ma,Shixiang Tang,Xiaotong Li,Wenhan Yang,Ling-Yu Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), a framework for improving monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) under real-world domain shifts by minimizing both semantic and geometric uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is vital for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving but is challenged by domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor variations.

Method: The proposed method, DUO, minimizes semantic and geometric uncertainties through a dual-branch mechanism. It introduces a novel unsupervised version of the focal loss for uncertainty weighting, alongside a semantic-aware normal field constraint to enhance geometric coherence.

Result: The DUO framework outperforms existing test-time adaptation approaches across various datasets and domain shift scenarios, demonstrating superior robustness and adaptability.

Conclusion: DUO effectively addresses the dual uncertainties in M3OD and improves test-time adaptation, enhancing both spatial perception and semantic classification for robust real-world application.

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

TL;DR: CogVLA introduces a cognition-aligned framework for Vision-Language-Action models, improving efficiency and performance via instruction-driven routing and sparsification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational overhead and scalability limitations in Vision-Language-Action models that rely on extensive post-training.

Method: Introducing a 3-stage progressive architecture: Encoder-FiLM based Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing), LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing), and V-L-A Coupled Attention (CAtten).

Result: State-of-the-art performance demonstrated on the LIBERO benchmark and robotic tasks, achieving success rates of 97.4% and 70.0% while reducing training costs by 2.5x and inference latency by 2.8x compared to OpenVLA.

Conclusion: CogVLA efficiently combines sparsification and progressive architecture to support accurate and coherent action generation, making it a scalable solution for Vision-Language-Action tasks.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold
compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CaddieSet, a dataset linking golf swing posture to ball trajectory using computer vision and expert-derived key metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on golf shot precision lack a quantitative connection between golfers' swing posture and ball trajectory, limiting their actionable insights for improving swings.

Method: The authors created CaddieSet, a dataset using a computer vision-based method to segment swing videos into eight phases, capturing joint information and defining 15 key metrics based on expert golf knowledge.

Result: Experiments showed the feasibility of CaddieSet to predict ball trajectories using interpretable models, verifying that the swing feedback aligns with golf domain knowledge.

Conclusion: CaddieSet provides a novel approach to quantifying swing-to-outcome links, offering valuable insights for golf swing analysis in both research and the sports industry.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

*Xuanming Cao,Chengyu Tao,Yifeng Cheng,Juan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces IAENet, a framework leveraging both 2D pre-trained models and 3D point cloud models for improved surface anomaly detection in industrial manufacturing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surface anomaly detection in manufacturing highly benefits from geometric information, but 3D detection has lagged due to the lack of strong pre-trained models comparable to 2D ones.

Method: The authors propose IAENet, integrating 2D and 3D models using a novel Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically reweights scores from each modality based on their contribution.

Result: IAENet achieved new state-of-the-art results on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset, significantly lowering false positive rates.

Conclusion: The proposed IAENet enhances surface anomaly detection by effectively combining modalities while preserving unique strengths, showing potential for industrial use.

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

*En Ci,Shanyan Guan,Yanhao Ge,Yilin Zhang,Wei Li,Zhenyu Zhang,Jian Yang,Ying Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DescriptiveEdit, a framework for semantic image editing that improves accuracy and scalability by integrating reference-image features with text-to-image generation without requiring architectural modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic image editing methods face challenges such as reconstruction errors in inversion-based methods and limited dataset quality in instruction-based models.

Method: The proposed approach utilizes a Cross-Attentive UNet to merge features from a reference image into the text-to-image editing process, avoiding reconstruction errors and maintaining generative model capabilities.

Result: DescriptiveEdit achieves better editing accuracy and consistency when evaluated on the Emu Edit benchmark.

Conclusion: This method preserves generative model capabilities while overcoming dataset quality limitations, showcasing enhanced semantic editing performance and scalability.

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

*Wenting Yin,Han Sun,Xinru Meng,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCFS is proposed to improve continual test-time adaptation by introducing dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of adapting pre-trained models to target domain data without source domain data, minimizing pseudo-label errors and learning biases.

Method: Utilizes dual classifiers to isolate semantic and domain-related features, maintaining feature consistency and applying confidence-weighted self-supervised learning strategies.

Result: Validated through experiments on datasets like CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C, showing improved model performance in adaptation tasks.

Conclusion: DCFS effectively alleviates learning biases and error propagation during continual test-time adaptation by introducing innovative feature representation and learning strategies.

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes improving camera calibration for novel view synthesis using a 3DGS model and backpropagation of color loss, achieving a PSNR improvement of 0.4 dB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate camera calibration is critical for novel view synthesis, as even minor calibration errors can significantly impact reconstruction quality.

Method: Use a 3DGS model to fine-tune camera calibration via backpropagation of color loss with respect to camera parameters.

Result: The proposed calibration method results in an average improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the reference dataset.

Conclusion: The fine-tuning method optimizes camera calibration, enhancing novel view synthesis quality, especially for critical reference scenes like Mip-NeRF 360.

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

*Jingyun Yang,Guoqing Zhang,Jingge Wang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the need for efficient gross tumor volume segmentation in multi-modal medical imaging by introducing an active and sequential domain adaptation framework focusing on informative and representative sample selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiotherapy planning requires accurate tumor segmentation, but labeling medical images is costly; thus, active domain adaptation provides a way to optimize this process. The authors seek to improve these methods.

Method: They propose an active and sequential domain adaptation approach with a dynamic query strategy that prioritizes labeling based on informativeness and representativeness, overcoming redundancy and negative transfer in multi-modal medical imaging.

Result: Their framework outperformed existing state-of-the-art ADA methods in multiple tasks related to gross tumor volume segmentation.

Conclusion: The introduced ADA framework reduces annotation costs while achieving superior performance in medical segmentation tasks, representing a step forward for radiotherapy planning.

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

### [114] [Enhancing Pseudo-Boxes via Data-Level LiDAR-Camera Fusion for Unsupervised 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20530)
*Mingqian Ji,Jian Yang,Shanshan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel data-level fusion framework using RGB images and LiDAR data for unsupervised 3D object detection, significantly improving pseudo-box quality and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually annotated 3D labels for LiDAR-based object detection are costly and labor-intensive, motivating the need for unsupervised approaches leveraging auxiliary data like RGB images.

Method: The paper proposes early-stage data fusion using RGB and LiDAR data, employing vision foundation models for instance segmentation and depth estimation, along with bi-directional fusion and noise reduction techniques.

Result: The method achieves 28.4% mAP on the nuScenes validation benchmark, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Integrating RGB and LiDAR data at a data level with advanced filtering and self-evolution strategies significantly boosts unsupervised 3D object detection accuracy.

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning method to estimate BMI from images using a large proprietary dataset. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and demonstrates robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BMI estimation from camera images fulfills the need for rapid weight assessment in situations where traditional methods are infeasible, such as telehealth or emergencies.

Method: The study uses a deep learning model trained on a curated dataset (WayBED) of over 71,000 high-quality smartphone images. An automatic filtering system removes low-quality images to improve training.

Result: Achieved a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on their test set, 13% on an unseen dataset, and 8.56% after fine-tuning, setting new benchmarks in BMI estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: The method delivers reliable BMI estimation, demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, and is deployable on mobile devices via the CLAID framework, with all code made open-source.

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source
contributions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study compares the performance of domain adaptation techniques across natural and medical datasets, highlighting the outstanding results of the DSAN algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates the potential of domain adaptation techniques to handle data distribution differences, aiming to bridge a gap in applying DA effectively to medical datasets.

Method: The study performs 557 simulation experiments across five natural and eight medical datasets using seven DA techniques, testing scenarios like out-of-distribution and limited training samples.

Result: The DSAN algorithm showed notable accuracy improvements, including 91.2% classification on COVID-19 data and enhanced performance (+6.7%) in dynamic data stream scenarios.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the capability of DSAN and offer valuable insights on adapting domain adaptation methods for medical imaging datasets.

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

*Lucas Rakotoarivony*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CLAB, a contrastive learning approach for feature enhancement in video object detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance without increasing inference computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video object detection faces challenges like motion blur, occlusion, and shape deformations, which make it more difficult than still-image detection. The paper aims to improve robustness to these challenges without increasing computational overhead.

Method: The proposed CLAB method incorporates a contrastive auxiliary branch with contrastive loss to improve feature representation, along with a dynamic loss weighting strategy to balance auxiliary learning and detection during training.

Result: CLAB achieves performance gains with 84.0% mAP using ResNet-101 and 85.2% mAP with ResNeXt-101 on the ImageNet VID dataset, surpassing prior CNN-based models.

Conclusion: The CLAB method enhances video object detection by improving robustness to image degradation, achieving state-of-the-art results without requiring additional post-processing or computational load during inference.

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

### [118] [Towards Mechanistic Defenses Against Typographic Attacks in CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20570)
*Lorenz Hufe,Constantin Venhoff,Maximilian Dreyer,Sebastian Lapuschkin,Wojciech Samek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses typographic attacks targeting CLIP vision encoders and proposes a training-free defense method which identifies and disables attention heads responsible for processing harmful text. The approach boosts robustness against attacks while minimally impacting standard performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To counteract typographic attacks that exploit text in images to manipulate multi-modal systems such as CLIP, with potential malicious consequences in safety-critical applications.

Method: The authors identify attention heads involved in processing typographic information and introduce a defense strategy by selectively ablating these circuits, improving robustness without finetuning models.

Result: The proposed defense improves performance by up to 19.6% on typographic ImageNet-100 while reducing standard accuracy by less than 1%, proving competitive against finetuned solutions.

Conclusion: The introduced dyslexic CLIP models offer a robust alternative for applications prone to text-based manipulations, ensuring safer multi-modal system deployment without relying on finetuning.

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FER systems face challenges like occlusion and lack of interpretability. Graph Neural Networks are proposed to overcome these issues by leveraging relational dependencies between facial landmarks.

Method: The method involves extracting facial landmarks using 3D facial alignment and constructing a quotient graph through hierarchical coarsening for structured learning.

Result: GLaRE achieved 64.89% accuracy on AffectNet and 94.24% accuracy on FERG, outperforming baselines. Ablation studies highlighted the efficacy of region-level embeddings.

Conclusion: Graph-based approaches like GLaRE enhance FER system performance by improving structured learning and interpretability, making them suitable for applications requiring high prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

*Zheng Chong,Yanwei Lei,Shiyue Zhang,Zhuandi He,Zhen Wang,Xujie Zhang,Xiao Dong,Yiling Wu,Dongmei Jiang,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current virtual try-on methods face challenges with multi-reference outfits and inefficiency due to redundant computations. The proposed FastFit framework addresses these challenges through cacheable diffusion architecture, improving speed and fidelity while introducing a comprehensive dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in virtual try-on technology, specifically the inability to handle multi-reference outfits and inefficiency caused by redundant computations.

Method: FastFit introduces a cacheable diffusion architecture using Semi-Attention and class embeddings to decouple reference encoding from the denoising process, improving efficiency. Additionally, DressCode-MR, a large-scale dataset, is provided for multi-reference try-ons.

Result: FastFit achieves a 3.5x speedup in inference efficiency compared to prior methods, while improving fidelity metrics and handling multi-reference compositions effectively across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: FastFit addresses efficiency and compositional challenges in virtual try-on, sets a new benchmark for fidelity metrics, and provides a valuable dataset for future research.

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

*Yuqi Han,Songqian Zhang,Weijian Su,Ke Li,Jiayu Yang,Jinli Suo,Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UTA-Sign, an unsupervised approach that combines thermal and event cameras for better traffic signage detection in low-light conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address safety risks in low-light autonomous driving caused by the limitations of thermal cameras and to leverage the complementary strengths of thermal and event cameras.

Method: The proposed method fuses thermal frames with event signals using a dual-boosting mechanism, aligning non-uniform event data with thermal frames for consistent temporal representation.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show improved traffic signage representation and detection accuracy.

Conclusion: The UTA-Sign framework effectively combines thermal and neuromorphic data to overcome the limitations of each modality, enhancing the safety and reliability of automated systems in low-light conditions.

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

*Mengxiao Huang,Minglei Shu,Shuwang Zhou,Zhaoyang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an active defense mechanism against deepfake techniques by using low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face-swapping manipulations while maintaining visual plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake technology poses privacy and societal risks, and current detection methods are primarily passive, lacking proactive prevention.

Method: The method employs low-frequency perceptual perturbations to interfere with generative processes in deepfake models, using combined frequency and spatial domain features and leveraging discrete wavelet transform (DWT) within a designed architecture.

Result: Experimental results on CelebA-HQ and LFW datasets demonstrate reduced effectiveness of face-swapping models, higher defense success rates, and preserved visual quality.

Conclusion: The proposed active defense mechanism effectively diminishes deepfake manipulation capabilities while maintaining natural appearance.

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Diverse-T2M, a method to generate diverse 3D human motions from text while maintaining text-motion consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of generating diverse 3D human motions from text while ensuring consistency and quality.

Method: The method combines noise signals in transformer-based modeling for uncertainty and introduces stochastic sampling in a latent space for enhanced diversity.

Result: Experiments using benchmark datasets (HumanML3D and KIT-ML) show improved diversity in generated motions with maintained semantic consistency.

Conclusion: Diverse-T2M effectively balances diversity and consistency in text-to-motion generation, advancing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intraoperative ultrasound images are difficult to interpret due to the limited field of view and complex anatomy in liver surgery. A method is needed to align these images with preoperative data for better surgical guidance.

Method: The authors propose an optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom to reconstruct 3D IVUS volumes and align with preoperative CT images.

Result: The method achieved calibration errors between 0.88 to 1.80 mm and registration errors of 3.40 to 5.71 mm using in vivo swine liver images.

Conclusion: The proposed technique provides reliable and accurate calibration and reconstruction, enhancing the registration of ultrasound with CT images to improve intraoperative guidance in liver surgery.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A proposed method uses physics-informed generative models (PI-GenMFI) to efficiently create synthetic Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) data to aid machine learning defect localization in semiconductor manufacturing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semiconductor defect detection relies on efficient ROI localization. MFI is faster than X-ray for this purpose, but proprietary concerns limit available datasets needed for ML training.

Method: Develop PI-GenMFI, a physics-informed generative model integrating diffusion principles to generate synthetic MFI images for training defect localization ML algorithms.

Result: Generated synthetic images effectively train ML algorithms and outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like VAEs and alternative diffusion methods based on expert and metric evaluations.

Conclusion: PI-GenMFI demonstrated strong potential to supplement MFI datasets, enhancing the ML-driven localization process for semiconductor defects.

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

*Yixiang Qiu,Yanhan Liu,Hongyao Yu,Hao Fang,Bin Chen,Shu-Tao Xia,Ke Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel GAN-based framework to improve data reconstruction attacks (DRAs) in split inference (SI), addressing privacy risks by enhancing semantic fidelity and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address privacy concerns arising from split inference (SI) in deep neural networks, where intermediate features can be exploited to reconstruct sensitive input data, a limitation in existing DRAs.

Method: The authors propose a Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO) framework integrated into a GAN, utilizing hierarchical decomposition and incremental refinement of intermediate representations. An L1-ball constraint is also introduced to stabilize optimization.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing DRAs, particularly for high-resolution images, out-of-distribution scenarios, and complex DNN architectures.

Conclusion: The research indicates that enhancing semantic fidelity in DRAs through the proposed GAN-based method effectively raises the quality of data reconstruction attacks, revealing privacy vulnerabilities in SI systems.

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

TL;DR: EmoCAST is a framework for generating emotionally expressive talking head videos using advanced methods like text-guided decoupled emotive modules and audio attention modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in control flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality in emotional talking head synthesis, which are further exacerbated by datasets collected in constrained lab settings.

Method: EmoCAST includes a diffusion-based framework with modules like text-guided emotive modeling and an emotive audio attention module to better integrate text and audio for emotion-driven facial motion synthesis. It also introduces a new emotional talking head dataset with unique training strategies.

Result: The framework delivers superior performance compared to existing methods, generating talking head videos that are more realistic, emotionally expressive, and accurately synchronized with audio.

Conclusion: EmoCAST significantly improves upon existing methods for generating emotional talking head videos and is better suited for real-world applications due to its novel architecture and enhanced dataset and training strategies.

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,
and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a SwinUNETR-based AI solution for improving breast MRI diagnosis, achieving second place in a multi-center challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of breast cancer is crucial in reducing mortality rates, especially in high-risk women or those with dense breast tissue.

Method: The authors developed a SwinUNETR framework utilizing breast region masking, data augmentation, and ensemble learning, tested on 511 studies from diverse MRI scanners.

Result: The proposed AI solution earned second place in the ODELIA challenge, demonstrating strong potential for breast MRI diagnostics.

Conclusion: The SwinUNETR methodology shows promise for enhancing clinical breast MRI interpretation, and the codebase is publicly shared for further development.

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in
women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection,
particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where
mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center
challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and
classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers,
acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study
was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or
malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that
incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble
learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second
place on the challenge leaderboard, highlighting its potential to support
clinical breast MRI interpretation. We publicly share our codebase at

### [129] [AvatarBack: Back-Head Generation for Complete 3D Avatars from Front-View Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20623)
*Shiqi Xin,Xiaolin Zhang,Yanbin Liu,Peng Zhang,Caifeng Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AvatarBack is a framework for improving 3D head avatar reconstruction, focusing on back-head regions using generative and alignment innovations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods using Gaussian Splatting for 3D head avatar modeling fail to reconstruct back-head regions effectively, creating issues like structural blurring and reduced realism.

Method: AvatarBack employs a Subject-specific Generator (SSG) to synthesize identity-consistent back-view pseudo-images and an Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy (ASA) for precise alignment between synthetic views and Gaussian representation.

Result: Experiments on datasets like NeRSemble and K-hairstyle show significant improvement in the realism and quality of back-head reconstruction without compromising frontal fidelity.

Conclusion: AvatarBack offers a practical and effective solution for full 3D avatar reconstruction, ensuring consistency, visual realism, and animatability.

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

*Francois Poh,Anjith George,Sébastien Marcel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates using foundation models to enhance facial recognition in historical paintings, improving upon limitations of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of sitter identification in historical paintings, which is often subjective and hindered by stylistic variations and lack of data.

Method: Fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings with conventional facial recognition networks to better handle artistic and stylistic variations.

Result: Enhanced recognition accuracy, achieving improvements over existing state-of-the-art for identifying faces in artwork.

Conclusion: Foundation models can effectively bridge the gap in facial recognition for art where traditional methods falter, aiding art historians.

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

### [131] [CraftGraffiti: Exploring Human Identity with Custom Graffiti Art via Facial-Preserving Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20640)
*Ayan Banerjee,Fernando Vilariño,Josep Lladós*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CraftGraffiti is a text-guided graffiti generation framework that preserves facial identity even under extreme stylistic transformations, using style transfer, self-attention mechanisms, and CLIP-guided re-posing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of preserving facial identity in generative art, particularly in graffiti-style transformations, where subtle changes could render a subject unrecognizable.

Method: The framework employs a combination of graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned diffusion transformers, identity-preserving self-attention mechanisms, and CLIP-guided prompt extension for pose customization.

Result: CraftGraffiti achieves competitive facial feature consistency and state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores. It has also been validated in real-world events like the Cruilla Festival.

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti combines stylistic flexibility with facial recognizability, advancing AI-assisted, identity-respectful artistry in creative applications.

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

### [132] [Improving Alignment in LVLMs with Debiased Self-Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20655)
*Sihan Yang,Chenhang Cui,Zihao Zhao,Yiyang Zhou,Weilong Yan,Ying Wei,Huaxiu Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method to reduce hallucinations in Large Language Models and Large Visual-Language Models without relying on external resources, using an internally generated self-evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in aligning visual and linguistic modalities in LLMs and LVLMs, as existing methods often lead to hallucinations and are costly due to dependence on external datasets or human annotations.

Method: The authors introduce a self-evaluation metric called the 'debiased self-judgment score,' which is generated internally by the model itself, enhancing decoding strategies and preference tuning without external resources.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional methods, with reduced hallucinations, enhanced safety, and better overall model capability.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for improving alignment in LVLMs by enabling autonomous self-improvement and reducing reliance on external resources.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

*Anastasios Skoularikis,Stefanos-Iordanis Papadopoulos,Symeon Papadopoulos,Panagiotis C. Petrantonakis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces S-HArM, a multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification and investigates methods to train models for intent detection in AI-generated images, showing that visual context improves generalization but remains challenging overall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitation of current multimodal AI, which neglects the intent behind AI-generated images, by building a dataset and methods to classify content intent as Humor/Satire, Art, or Misinformation.

Method: They created S-HArM, a dataset of 9,576 image-text pairs, and explored various strategies for generating additional synthetic training data using Stable Diffusion. They also tested several techniques involving contrastive learning, reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language models.

Result: Models trained using image- and multimodally-guided data preserve visual context and generalize better to real-world data. However, the overall capability to infer intent is still limited, showing the complexity of the problem.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that while preserving visual context is beneficial, inferring intent in AI-generated images remains a difficult challenge, necessitating advancements in specialized architectures.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic
and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the
intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the
wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art,
or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies
(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MobileCLIP2, an improved version of the MobileCLIP model, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot accuracies with low latency. Key innovations include enhanced teacher ensembles and fine-tuned captioner models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance MobileCLIP's zero-shot accuracy by improving efficiency, scalability, and training methods for image-text pairing using multimodal reinforced training.

Method: The study enhances MobileCLIP with better teacher models (CLIP ensembles and captioners), explores ablations, and combines synthetic captions for improved training. These upgrades lead to the development of MobileCLIP2.

Result: MobileCLIP2 delivers significant improvements: up to 2.2% in ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracy and comparable results with larger baselines, all at lower latency and smaller architecture sizes.

Conclusion: MobileCLIP2 demonstrates that refining teacher models, caption diversity, and synthetic datasets fosters efficient high-performant multimodal models. The approach also facilitates reproducibility and scalability via released code.

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data
generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary
teachers using distributed scalable processing.

*Chenhao Zhang,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dynamic video compression framework that addresses precise rate control for variable bitrate scenarios using a Dynamic-Route Autoencoder and Rate Control Agent. It achieves significant performance improvements in rate-distortion metrics over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise rate control in Neural Video Compression remains a challenge due to limitations in learning-based codecs, necessitating advancements for variable bitrate scenarios.

Method: The Dynamic-Route Autoencoder provides variable coding routes for distinct rate-distortion trade-offs, paired with a Rate Control Agent for runtime bitrate adjustments. Collaborative training via Joint-Routes Optimization ensures efficiency across variable bitrates.

Result: Experiments on datasets like HEVC and UVG demonstrate improved compression, achieving a BD-Rate reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB, with an average bitrate error of 1.66%.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully achieves Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for variable bitrate and bitrate-constrained applications, advancing the neural video compression field.

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving
Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and
bitrate-constrained applications. Our code is available at

*Reza Akbari Movahed,Abuzar Rezaee,Arezoo Zakeri,Colin Berry,Edmond S. L. Ho,Ali Gooya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CardioMorphNet, a Bayesian deep learning model for accurately estimating cardiac motion from Cine CMR images using shape-guided deformable registration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate cardiac motion estimation is essential for cardiac function evaluation, but existing methods struggle due to reliance on intensity-based similarity losses that overlook anatomical regions.

Method: CardioMorphNet utilizes a recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework, employing a variational autoencoder and posterior models for segmentation and motion estimation, while using segmentation maps instead of intensity-based losses.

Result: The model achieved superior performance in motion estimation on the UK Biobank dataset and demonstrated lower uncertainty in the motion fields within cardiac regions compared to other methods.

Conclusion: CardioMorphNet more effectively and confidently estimates cardiac motion, overcoming limitations of existing methods and advancing the field of cardiac motion estimation.

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-time solution for improving domain robustness in identifying atypical mitotic figures, achieving competitive results in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consistent identification of atypical mitotic figures is challenging due to domain shift from scanner and stain variations.

Method: The approach involves style perturbations, feature alignment with domain labels, and prediction stabilization using EMA distillation.

Result: Balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499 achieved in the challenge leaderboard.

Conclusion: The proposed method, leveraging coarse domain labels, delivers strong and balanced results with minimal inference-time overhead.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet
remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift
stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple
training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted
at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across
sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an
auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from
an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL
divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis
classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity
of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs
negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and
delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive
submission for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies and resolves reward hacking issues in GRPO-based reinforcement learning for text-to-image (T2I) generation. It introduces Pref-GRPO, which uses pairwise preferences to ensure stable training, and UniGenBench, a holistic benchmarking framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address reward hacking issues in reinforcement learning for T2I generation and improve benchmarking methods to comprehensively evaluate model performance.

Method: The paper introduces Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference reward-based optimization method, and UniGenBench, a unified benchmark for T2I evaluation. Pref-GRPO uses pairwise image comparisons and win rates to refine the reward model, while UniGenBench evaluates T2I systems based on a comprehensive set of semantic consistency criteria.

Result: Pref-GRPO achieves more stable training, mitigates reward hacking, and differentiates subtle image quality differences more effectively than pointwise methods. UniGenBench identifies strengths and weaknesses of various T2I models and demonstrates Pref-GRPO's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed Pref-GRPO method offers a robust solution to reward hacking, enhancing T2I generation stability. UniGenBench further advances evaluation methods, creating a comprehensive framework to assess T2I model performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show that C3-GS achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability.

Conclusion: C3-GS improves feature learning and fusion, enabling photorealistic synthesis for unseen scenes without additional supervision or per-scene optimization.

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen
scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements
utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate
geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a
framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware,
cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three
lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.

*Jiawen Lin,Shiran Bian,Yihang Zhu,Wenbin Tan,Yachao Zhang,Yuan Xie,Yanyun Qu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SeqVLM, a zero-shot 3D Visual Grounding framework, which uses multi-view images and spatial reasoning to localize objects in 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing zero-shot 3DVG methods, like single-view reasoning constraints and contextual detail degradations, and to enhance real-world applicability without scene-specific training.

Method: SeqVLM employs 3D semantic segmentation to generate proposals, refines them using semantic filtering, projects the 3D proposals to multi-view sequences of real-world images while preserving spatial relationships, and dynamically schedules VLM processing for efficient query-prompt alignment.

Result: SeqVLM achieves state-of-the-art results on ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks with Acc@0.25 scores of 55.6% and 53.2%, outperforming previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%, respectively.

Conclusion: SeqVLM demonstrates improved generalization and real-world applicability for zero-shot 3D Visual Grounding, advancing toward practical usage beyond constrained settings.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the robustness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), specifically CLIP variants, in occluded and challenging military environments, revealing critical insights about performance with different occlusion levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs like CLIP show promise in scenarios with scarce labeled data, making them appealing for defense applications. However, their robustness in degraded and occluded military environments has not been adequately studied.

Method: The study evaluates CLIP variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle classes and analyzes Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across various occlusion percentages.

Result: Key findings include: (1) transformer-based CLIP models outperform CNNs, (2) dispersed occlusions degrade performance more severely than contiguous ones, (3) linear-probed models have performance drops at ~35% occlusion, whereas finetuned models show resilience until ~60% occlusion.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the significance of occlusion-specific training augmentations, patch-level sensitivity analysis, and architectural improvements for deploying CLIP in real-world military scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

*Gowreesh Mago,Pascal Mettes,Stevan Rudinac*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of understanding abstract concepts in video content, utilizing recent advancements in foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between machine video understanding, which is currently focused on concrete entities, and human-level reasoning, which includes abstract concepts.

Method: Surveys past tasks, datasets, and efforts aimed at abstract concept recognition in videos and argues for leveraging multi-modal foundation models.

Result: The study observes periodic attempts at addressing this challenge and emphasizes the potential of foundation models for advancing abstract concept recognition.

Conclusion: The paper stresses the importance of building on decades of community work to address abstract video understanding challenges efficiently, avoiding redundancy in the modern era of foundation models.

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

### [143] [Safer Skin Lesion Classification with Global Class Activation Probability Map Evaluation and SafeML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20776)
*Kuniko Paxton,Koorosh Aslansefat,Amila Akagić,Dhavalkumar Thakker,Yiannis Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to enhance trustworthiness and explainability in skin lesion classification models by probabilistically analyzing class activation maps and detecting false diagnoses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses distrust in AI diagnostics for skin lesion classification, emphasizing the need for explainable and reliable diagnostic processes beyond high model accuracy.

Method: The proposed method employs a probabilistic analysis of class activation maps at the pixel level and integrates SafeML to detect false diagnoses and issue warnings.

Result: The method was evaluated using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and Vision Transformers, aiming to validate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves explainability, diagnostic reliability, and patient safety by providing unified visualizations and false diagnosis detection.

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

### [144] [Evaluating Compositional Generalisation in VLMs and Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20783)
*Beth Pearson,Bilal Boulbarss,Michael Wray,Martha Lewis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the compositional generalization of vision-language models (VLMs), particularly assessing how well they bind objects to attributes and relations using tools such as Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs, such as CLIP, demonstrate limitations in their ability to handle compositional semantics, which is critical for understanding novel meanings formed from known parts. The paper aims to assess whether generative models like Diffusion Classifier improve upon these limitations.

Method: The authors evaluated three models—Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT—on their capacity for object-attribute and relational binding under zero-shot (ZSL) and generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) frameworks.

Result: Diffusion Classifier and ViLT exhibited good performance in concept binding tasks but struggled in relational GZSL tasks. Analyses revealed that CLIP embeddings fail to differentiate relational concepts effectively.

Conclusion: While Diffusion Classifier and ViLT show potential in some compositional tasks, relational reasoning remains a significant challenge for VLMs, pointing to the need for further improvements in this field.

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

### [145] [ChainReaction! Structured Approach with Causal Chains as Intermediate Representations for Improved and Explainable Causal Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21010)
*Paritosh Parmar,Eric Peh,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a modular framework to improve causal reasoning and answer generation in VideoQA by decoupling reasoning processes and utilizing interpretable causal chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoQA systems face challenges in higher-order reasoning and lack interpretability, as they rely on black-box pipelines.

Method: A two-stage architecture consists of a Causal Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates interpretable causal chains and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) using these chains for answer generation. High-quality causal chains are created using large language models.

Result: Experiments on large benchmarks reveal the model’s superiority in accuracy, explainability, user trust, and generalization over state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: The modular, interpretable framework improves VideoQA reasoning, supports generalization, and positions CCE as a reusable tool across domains.

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

### [146] [Surfel-based 3D Registration with Equivariant SE(3) Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20789)
*Xueyang Kang,Hang Zhao,Kourosh Khoshelham,Patrick Vandewalle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel surfel-based approach to improve robustness and accuracy in point cloud registration for 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for point cloud registration overlook point orientations and uncertainties, leading to vulnerabilities from noisy data and aggressive transformations, necessitating extensive augmented training datasets.

Method: The proposed method uses surfel initialization from Lidar point clouds paired with SE(3) equivariant features obtained via convolutional kernels. It incorporates a pipeline featuring an equivariant encoder, cross-attention mechanism, decoder, and Huber loss.

Result: Experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show improved robustness and performance over state-of-the-art methods on real point cloud scans.

Conclusion: The approach successfully tackles noise and transformation challenges, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in point cloud registration tasks.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

*Tao Luo,Han Wu,Tong Yang,Dinggang Shen,Zhiming Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DVCTNet, a novel dual-view co-training network, for enhanced dental caries detection by integrating panoramic X-ray images and cropped tooth images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving accuracy in dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays, addressing challenges posed by subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion morphology.

Method: DVCTNet uses dual views (global panoramic X-ray and local cropped tooth images), pretrains separate vision models, integrates features via a Gated Cross-View Attention module, and evaluates detection results on public and newly curated datasets.

Result: DVCTNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in caries detection on both a public dataset and a newly curated dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed DVCTNet method demonstrates superior accuracy and clinical applicability for dental caries detection, with code and resources made publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

### [148] [FusionCounting: Robust visible-infrared image fusion guided by crowd counting via multi-task learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20817)
*He Li,Xinyu Liu,Weihang Kong,Xingchen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework called FusionCounting, integrating crowd counting with image fusion processes, improving both outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VIF methods mostly focus on image quality or other downstream tasks like semantic segmentation or object detection. However, these tasks face challenges such as annotation demands and complex crowded scenes. There’s also no prior work combining VIF and crowd counting.

Method: The authors propose the FusionCounting framework, a multi-task approach combining VIF and crowd counting. It uses a dynamic loss weighting strategy for balance and incorporates adversarial training for robustness.

Result: Experimental results show that FusionCounting enhances the quality of image fusion and achieves better crowd counting accuracy compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: FusionCounting demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating crowd counting into the image fusion process, paving the way for robust, multi-functional VIF systems.

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a VLM-based pipeline with LoRA for enhanced 2D keypoint estimation of surgical tools, showing superior performance with minimal fine-tuning over traditional methods in small medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of overfitting and limited generalization in traditional approaches for medical datasets while improving keypoint detection of surgical tools.

Method: The approach leverages Vision Language Models fine-tuned with the LoRA technique, paired with designed prompts to instructional data for aligning visual features to semantic keypoint descriptions. The pipeline is optimized using only two epochs of fine-tuning.

Result: The adapted VLM performed better than baseline models, showcasing its generalization capabilities and effectiveness in low-resource medical scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly improves keypoint detection for surgical tools, opening pathways for advancements in 3D pose estimation of surgical hands and tools.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work
in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

*Hao Yang,Qianyu Zhou,Haijia Sun,Xiangtai Li,Xuequan Lu,Lizhuang Ma,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PointDGRWKV, a framework using RWKV architecture for enhancing domain generalization in point cloud classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve generalization in point cloud classification (PCC) models, addressing limitations in current architectures such as limited receptive fields, high computational cost, and insufficient long-range dependency.

Method: The proposed method, PointDGRWKV, incorporates Adaptive Geometric Token Shift for local geometric modeling and Cross-Domain Key Feature Distribution Alignment to mitigate attention issues, while leveraging RWKV's efficient architecture.

Result: PointDGRWKV achieves state-of-the-art performance in domain generalization (DG) for point cloud classification across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully adapts the RWKV architecture for DG PCC by addressing spatial distortion and attention drift challenges, demonstrating its efficacy and efficiency.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PathMR, a multimodal visual reasoning framework designed for pathological image analysis, generating diagnostic explanations and predicting cell patterns. It outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in multiple metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional deep learning diagnostic tools, which lack transparency and traceability, by introducing a model that provides clear and interpretable explanations.

Method: They developed PathMR, a system that integrates visual and textual modalities to analyze pathological images, generate diagnostic explanations, and predict cell distributions. The system was tested on both the PathGen and GADVR datasets.

Result: PathMR demonstrated superior performance in text explanation quality, segmentation accuracy, and the alignment of visual and textual data compared to other current methods.

Conclusion: PathMR enhances the transparency and interpretability of AI-driven pathological diagnostics, making it a step toward more dependable clinical applications of AI. The code is publicly accessible for further use and development.

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a deep learning framework using dual-modality imaging to enhance early detection of pancreatic cancer, achieving over 90% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly lethal due to late detection, calling for improved early detection techniques.

Method: The framework employs deep learning on autofluorescence and second harmonic generation imaging, comparing CNNs and Vision Transformers, and optimizing with techniques such as pre-trained layers and class-weighted training.

Result: The optimized ResNet-based framework achieved over 90% accuracy in detecting cancer across 40 patient samples, outperforming manual analysis methods.

Conclusion: The work provides a promising automated detection pipeline for PDAC with clinical deployment potential and insight for applying deep learning on small medical datasets.

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

*Pushkar Shukla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This thesis presents frameworks using counterfactual reasoning to explain, audit, and mitigate biases in vision classifiers and text-to-image generative models. It uncovers spurious correlations and strengthens model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to leverage counterfactual reasoning to enhance interpretability, fairness, and causal understanding in AI models, addressing biases in classification and generation tasks.

Method: Frameworks introduced include CAVLI for concept-level reliance analysis, ASAC for adversarial counterfactual fairness in classifiers, and TIBET and BiasConnect for causal auditing and bias evaluation in generative models.

Result: The proposed methods systematically identify spurious correlations, diagnose biases (including intersectional ones), and improve fairness and accuracy in both classifier and generator systems.

Conclusion: Counterfactuals act as an effective tool for ensuring interpretability, fairness, and causality, enabling principled, scalable approaches to evaluating and mitigating bias in AI systems.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dino U-Net, an encoder-decoder model leveraging the DINOv3 foundation model for state-of-the-art medical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of effectively adapting pre-trained foundation models for precise clinical applications in medical image segmentation.

Method: Dino U-Net uses a frozen DINOv3 backbone with an adapter to integrate semantic and spatial features, along with a fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) to preserve feature quality during dimensionality reduction.

Result: Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven public medical image segmentation datasets, with improved accuracy as the backbone size scales.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that adapting dense, pre-trained features from general-purpose foundation models is a highly efficient approach for improving medical image segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep-learning approach using ConvNeXtBase ensembles for classifying normal and atypical mitotic figures in tumors, achieving strong performance metrics but highlighting the limitations of a rule-based refinement (RBR) module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The manual differentiation of atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) from normal mitotic figures (NMFs) is challenging due to its time-consuming and subjective nature, necessitating automated methods.

Method: An ensemble of ConvNeXtBase models was trained using AUCMEDI datasets and extended with a rule-based refinement (RBR) module to assess its impact on classification performance.

Result: The ConvNeXtBase ensemble achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02% on the MIDOG25 test set, although the inclusion of the RBR module boosted specificity at the cost of sensitivity and overall performance.

Conclusion: Deep-learning ensembles are effective for AMF classification. However, while the RBR module enhances certain metrics, it requires additional refinement to improve overall classification outcomes without trade-offs.

Abstract: Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading.
Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult,
as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble
of ConvNeXtBase models was trained with AUCMEDI and extend with a rule-based
refinement (RBR) module. On the MIDOG25 preliminary test set, the ensemble
achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it
reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep
ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional high-performance networks were not optimized for lightweight applications, limiting their usability. This paper aims to address this gap by optimizing ConvNeXt for lightweight use cases.

Method: The authors integrate the Cross Stage Partial Connections (CSPNet) mechanism into ConvNeXt, optimize its Stem and Block structures for efficiency, and replace Layer Scale with channel attention to enhance performance.

Result: E-ConvNeXt achieves notable performance: the mini-version obtains 78.3% Top-1 accuracy at 0.9GFLOPs, and the small version achieves 81.9% Top-1 accuracy at 3.1GFLOPs on ImageNet. It also shows strong transfer learning performance in object detection.

Conclusion: E-ConvNeXt delivers an efficient, high-performing model that maintains accuracy under reduced complexity, making it well-suited for lightweight applications.

Abstract: Many high-performance networks were not designed with lightweight application
scenarios in mind from the outset, which has greatly restricted their scope of
application. This paper takes ConvNeXt as the research object and significantly
reduces the parameter scale and network complexity of ConvNeXt by integrating
the Cross Stage Partial Connections mechanism and a series of optimized
designs. The new network is named E-ConvNeXt, which can maintain high accuracy
performance under different complexity configurations. The three core
innovations of E-ConvNeXt are : (1) integrating the Cross Stage Partial Network
(CSPNet) with ConvNeXt and adjusting the network structure, which reduces the
model's network complexity by up to 80%; (2) Optimizing the Stem and Block
structures to enhance the model's feature expression capability and operational
efficiency; (3) Replacing Layer Scale with channel attention. Experimental
validation on ImageNet classification demonstrates E-ConvNeXt's superior
accuracy-efficiency balance: E-ConvNeXt-mini reaches 78.3% Top-1 accuracy at
0.9GFLOPs. E-ConvNeXt-small reaches 81.9% Top-1 accuracy at 3.1GFLOPs. Transfer
learning tests on object detection tasks further confirm its generalization
capability.

*Chenfan Qu,Yiwu Zhong,Bin Li,Lianwen Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of identifying manipulated regions in images, overcoming data scarcity by leveraging web data. It introduces novel techniques and tools to create a massive annotated dataset and proposes a model achieving state-of-the-art manipulation localization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the risks posed by manipulated images to social security and the lack of high-quality datasets for accurate manipulation localization.

Method: The methods introduced include CAAAv2 for automatic pixel-level annotation, QES for improving annotation reliability, construction of the large MIMLv2 dataset, Object Jitter for training enhancement, and development of a web-supervised model, Web-IML.

Result: MIMLv2 dataset with 246,212 annotated images was created, Web-IML showed a 31% improvement over baseline models, and surpassed TruFor by 24.1 IoU points on manipulation localization benchmarks.

Conclusion: Leveraging web-scale data and innovative techniques addresses data scarcity, enabling significant advancements in image manipulation localization models and datasets suitable for real-world tasks.

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/qcf-568/MIML.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExpertSim introduces a deep learning-based Mixture-of-Generative-Experts approach tailored for the Zero Degree Calorimeter in CERN's ALICE experiment, improving simulation efficiency and accuracy compared to traditional Monte Carlo methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulating particle collision detector responses is computationally expensive using traditional Monte Carlo methods, causing strain on CERN's resources. A more efficient approach is needed for high-accuracy simulations.

Method: ExpertSim employs a Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where specialized deep learning experts focus on distinct data subsets related to the calorimeter response.

Result: The proposed method achieves higher accuracy and faster execution speed for detector simulations compared to Monte Carlo techniques.

Conclusion: ExpertSim offers a promising solution for efficient and precise detector simulation in particle physics, reducing computational demands and enhancing simulation capabilities.

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

### [161] [POSE: Phased One-Step Adversarial Equilibrium for Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21019)
*Jiaxiang Cheng,Bing Ma,Xuhua Ren,Hongyi Jin,Kai Yu,Peng Zhang,Wenyue Li,Yuan Zhou,Tianxiang Zheng,Qinglin Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POSE is a video generation framework that accelerates large-scale video diffusion models by reducing sampling steps, enabling high-quality video creation in a single step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video acceleration methods are inefficient for long sequences and large-scale models, and lack temporal coherence and effective distillation for video generation.

Method: POSE utilizes a two-phase distillation process: stability priming to optimize video quality and unified adversarial equilibrium to achieve stable single-step training. Additionally, conditional adversarial consistency improves semantic and frame coherence in conditional video generation.

Result: POSE achieves significant efficiency improvement over other methods, reducing latency by 100x (from 1000 to 10 seconds) while maintaining high-quality results.

Conclusion: POSE provides an effective solution for accelerating video generation in large-scale models, balancing efficiency and output quality with innovations in adversarial distillation methods.

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free method to reduce computational redundancy in text-to-image diffusion models by clustering semantically similar prompts and sharing computation during early denoising steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models produce high-quality images but are computationally expensive. There is a need to improve efficiency, especially for correlated prompts.

Method: The proposed method clusters prompts based on semantic similarity and shares computations during early diffusion steps. Additionally, it uses UnClip’s text-to-image prior for enhancing diffusion step allocation.

Result: Experiments show reduced compute cost and improved image quality for models conditioned on image embeddings.

Conclusion: The approach integrates seamlessly into existing pipelines, scales well with large prompt sets, and minimizes both environmental and financial costs associated with large-scale generation.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

*Gennaro Percannella,Mattia Sarno,Francesco Tortorella,Mario Vento*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Mamba-based method for domain shift-resistant mitosis detection using a VM-UNet architecture and stain augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of performance drops in mitosis detection models when tested on images from different domains.

Method: The authors utilize a VM-UNet architecture combined with stain augmentation to tackle domain shifts in histopathology images.

Result: Preliminary experiments on the MIDOG++ dataset highlight significant room for improvement in the proposed method's performance.

Conclusion: While showing potential, the approach requires further refinement to enhance robustness and efficacy under domain shifts.

Abstract: Mitosis detection in histopathology images plays a key role in tumor
assessment. Although machine learning algorithms could be exploited for aiding
physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from
significative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains
that are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a
Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the
promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation
tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying
out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further
improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been
submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG)
challenge. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the MIDOG++ dataset, show
large room for improvement for the proposed method.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of identifying atypical mitotic figures in histopathology under domain shift using a multi-task learning approach to improve model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for accurate assessment of tumor aggressiveness in histopathology, but machine learning models struggle with domain shifts leading to reduced performance.

Method: The study uses multi-task learning with auxiliary tasks correlated to the main classification to ignore domain-varying background features.

Result: Promising performance outcomes were observed on multiple datasets including MIDOG 2025, Ami-Br, and MIDOG25 preliminary test set.

Conclusion: The multi-task learning approach enhances the focus of models on relevant features, showing potential for better generalization across different domains.

Abstract: Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows
physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning
models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under
domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this
work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this
problem. By exploiting auxiliary tasks, correlated to the main classification
task, the proposed approach, submitted to the track 2 of the MItosis DOmain
Generalization (MIDOG) challenge, aims to aid the model to focus only on the
object to classify, ignoring the domain varying background of the image. The
proposed approach shows promising performance in a preliminary evaluation
conducted on three distinct datasets, i.e., the MIDOG 2025 Atypical Training
Set, the Ami-Br dataset, as well as the preliminary test set of the MIDOG25

*Huynh Tong Dang Khoa,Dang Hoai Nam,Vo Nguyen Le Duy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FW-GAN, a one-shot handwriting synthesis method that uses Wave-MLP and frequency-guided approaches to generate realistic, style-consistent handwriting from a single sample.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of labeled handwriting data limits the effectiveness of handwriting recognition systems, and current synthesis methods struggle with long-range dependencies and ignore key frequency information necessary for capturing handwriting styles.

Method: The proposed FW-GAN integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP for modeling spatial relationships, a frequency-guided discriminator for authenticity detection, and a Frequency Distribution Loss to align the frequency characteristics of synthetic handwriting with real data.

Result: FW-GAN successfully synthesizes high-quality, writer-consistent handwriting and demonstrates its effectiveness on Vietnamese and English handwriting datasets, serving as an effective data augmentation tool for low-resource handwriting recognition tasks.

Conclusion: FW-GAN overcomes key challenges in handwriting synthesis by incorporating spatial and frequency-aware techniques, offering high-quality, style-consistent output and practical utility in handwriting recognition domains.

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

*Junpeng Ma,Qizhe Zhang,Ming Lu,Zhibin Wang,Qiang Zhou,Jun Song,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MMG-Vid, a framework for efficient visual token pruning in Video LLMs, achieving high performance while significantly improving computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in video understanding caused by excessive visual tokens, which pose computational challenges for real-world applications.

Method: They propose MMG-Vid, which uses segment-level and token-level pruning techniques. It divides videos into segments by frame similarity, dynamically allocates token budgets, and uses a temporal-guided DPC algorithm to maximize token importance based on inter-frame and intra-frame analysis.

Result: MMG-Vid reduces visual tokens by 75%, accelerates the prefilling stage by 3.9x, and retains over 99.5% of the original model's performance on the LLaVA-OneVision-7B model.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances computational efficiency and model performance, demonstrating significant token reduction while maintaining strong video understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HydraFake, a dataset addressing gaps in deepfake detection, and Veritas, a pattern-aware reasoning-based multi-modal model, achieving superior performance in real-world challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detectors fail in real-world scenarios due to homogeneous data in academic benchmarks, highlighting a need for more diverse and realistic datasets.

Method: The study introduces HydraFake, a dataset with diverse forgery techniques and new domains, and proposes Veritas, a deepfake detector with multi-modal reasoning and a two-stage training approach.

Result: Experiments show Veritas outperforms existing methods in handling unseen forgeries and out-of-distribution data while providing transparent detection outputs.

Conclusion: The combination of HydraFake and Veritas points to a significant advancement in bridging the gap between academic benchmarks and real-world deepfake detection challenges.

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FakeParts, a type of deepfake involving subtle, localized manipulations that are harder to detect, along with a benchmark dataset, FakePartsBench, for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial deepfakes, which involve subtle and partial modifications to videos, are difficult to detect and represent an emerging threat that current systems fail to address.

Method: The authors developed a new dataset, FakePartsBench, containing over 25,000 videos with precise manipulation annotations, and conducted user studies to evaluate detection challenges.

Result: FakePartsDeep manipulations reduced human detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar declines in detection performance for state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Existing detection systems are inadequate for identifying partial deepfakes, and the resources offered in this study provide a foundation for creating more effective detection solutions.

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods
for partial video manipulations.

TL;DR: The paper presents a multi-view 3D point tracker that accurately tracks points in dynamic scenes using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), overcoming challenges like depth ambiguities and occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for point tracking face challenges like requiring many cameras, depth ambiguities, or the need for per-sequence optimization. This paper aims to provide a practical and robust solution.

Method: The proposed method fuses multi-view features into a unified point cloud using known camera poses and depth information. It utilizes k-nearest-neighbors correlation combined with a transformer-based update for reliable 3D correspondence estimation.

Result: With training on synthetic datasets and evaluations on real-world benchmarks, the tracker achieved median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, demonstrating adaptability across diverse camera setups and lengths.

Conclusion: The tracker sets a new benchmark for 3D tracking research and is positioned as a practical tool for varied real-world applications.

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

Conclusion: The OneReward framework enhances generative capabilities across various tasks and eliminates the need for task-specific SFT, providing better generalization and training efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source
competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across
multiple evaluation dimensions. Code and model are available at:

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dress&Dance, a high-resolution video generation framework for virtual try-on experiences by combining input modalities effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a high-quality virtual try-on solution that incorporates user-specific garment fitting and motion fidelity using minimal input data.

Method: The framework integrates CondNet, a conditioning network that uses attention mechanisms and progressive training with multi-modal data, enabling the generation of realistic videos from limited datasets.

Result: Dress&Dance achieves a user-friendly and flexible virtual try-on system that surpasses both open-source and commercial alternatives.

Conclusion: This approach revolutionizes virtual try-on experiences, offering improved garment visualization and dynamic interaction with enhanced realism.

Abstract: We present Dress&Dance, a video diffusion framework that generates high
quality 5-second-long 24 FPS virtual try-on videos at 1152x720 resolution of a
user wearing desired garments while moving in accordance with a given reference
video. Our approach requires a single user image and supports a range of tops,
bottoms, and one-piece garments, as well as simultaneous tops and bottoms
try-on in a single pass. Key to our framework is CondNet, a novel conditioning
network that leverages attention to unify multi-modal inputs (text, images, and
videos), thereby enhancing garment registration and motion fidelity. CondNet is
trained on heterogeneous training data, combining limited video data and a
larger, more readily available image dataset, in a multistage progressive
manner. Dress&Dance outperforms existing open source and commercial solutions
and enables a high quality and flexible try-on experience.

*Fahad Shamshad,Tameem Bakr,Yahia Shaaban,Noor Hussein,Karthik Nandakumar,Nils Lukas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the robustness of digital content watermarks under adversarial attacks, presenting methods that effectively erase watermarks with high quality retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and stress-test the resilience of digital watermarking techniques against adversarial attacks.

Method: Developed adaptive watermark removal techniques: a VAE-based evasion method for a known watermarking model (beige-box track) and clustering plus image-to-image diffusion models for an unknown model (black-box track).

Result: Achieved near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with minimal quality degradation of residual images.

Conclusion: Existing watermarking methods must evolve as they are vulnerable to advanced attacks, prompting the need for more robust solutions.

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.

*Ruihao Li,Qinzhe Wu,Krishna Kavi,Gayatri Mehta,Jonathan C. Beard,Neeraja J. Yadwadkar,Lizy K. John*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SpeedMalloc, a memory allocator leveraging a lightweight support-core for multi-threaded applications, reduces cache conflicts and outperforms various modern allocators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory allocation significantly impacts program performance, especially in multi-threaded systems, due to metadata-related cache pollution and synchronization overhead.

Method: Introduced SpeedMalloc, leveraging a lightweight support-core processor to handle memory allocations efficiently and reduce cache and synchronization conflicts.

Result: SpeedMalloc offers speedups of 1.18x to 1.75x compared to popular memory allocators like Jemalloc, TCMalloc, and Mallacc.

Conclusion: SpeedMalloc demonstrates a scalable and adaptable solution for memory allocation in multi-threaded environments, significantly enhancing performance.

Abstract: Memory allocation, though constituting only a small portion of the executed
code, can have a "butterfly effect" on overall program performance, leading to
significant and far-reaching impacts. Despite accounting for just approximately
5% of total instructions, memory allocation can result in up to a 2.7x
performance variation depending on the allocator used. This effect arises from
the complexity of memory allocation in modern multi-threaded multi-core
systems, where allocator metadata becomes intertwined with user data, leading
to cache pollution or increased cross-thread synchronization overhead.
Offloading memory allocators to accelerators, e.g., Mallacc and Memento, is a
potential direction to improve the allocator performance and mitigate cache
pollution. However, these accelerators currently have limited support for
multi-threaded applications, and synchronization between cores and accelerators
remains a significant challenge.
  We present SpeedMalloc, using a lightweight support-core to process memory
allocation tasks in multi-threaded applications. The support-core is a
lightweight programmable processor with efficient cross-core data
synchronization and houses all allocator metadata in its own caches. This
design minimizes cache conflicts with user data and eliminates the need for
cross-core metadata synchronization. In addition, using a general-purpose core
instead of domain-specific accelerators makes SpeedMalloc capable of adopting
new allocator designs. We compare SpeedMalloc with state-of-the-art software
and hardware allocators, including Jemalloc, TCMalloc, Mimalloc, Mallacc, and
Memento. SpeedMalloc achieves 1.75x, 1.18x, 1.15x, 1.23x, and 1.18x speedups on
multithreaded workloads over these five allocators, respectively.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SwizzlePerf enhances GPU kernel performance by incorporating hardware-specific awareness into LLM-based optimization, achieving significant efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing search-based methods in GPU kernel optimization lack hardware-awareness, which is crucial for near-optimal performance engineering.

Method: SwizzlePerf employs hardware-specific insights such as memory access patterns, architecture specifications, and profiling data to guide LLMs in generating tailored spatial optimizations.

Result: SwizzlePerf drastically reduces optimization time (from 2 weeks to 5 minutes for GEMM kernel) and improves performance with up to 2.06x speedup and a 70% L2 cache hit rate improvement on tested kernels.

Conclusion: SwizzlePerf demonstrates the feasibility of hardware-aware LLM agents in performance engineering, marking a pivotal move toward systematic optimizations for disaggregated architectures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in GPU kernel performance
engineering using inefficient search-based methods that optimize around
runtime. Any existing approach lacks a key characteristic that human
performance engineers rely on for near-optimal utilization --
hardware-awareness. By leveraging the workload's specific memory access
patterns, architecture specifications, filtered profiling logs, and reflections
on historical performance, we can make software-level optimizations that are
tailored to the underlying hardware. SwizzlePerf automatically generates
spatial optimizations for GPU kernels on disaggregated architectures by giving
LLMs explicit hardware-awareness.
  For a GEMM kernel, SwizzlePerf takes less than 5 minutes to generate the same
hardware-specific optimal swizzling pattern that took expert performance
engineers 2 weeks to find. On a suite of 10 diverse ML and Science kernels,
SwizzlePerf can generate swizzling patterns for 9 of the kernels that achieve
up to a 2.06x speedup and 70% improvement in L2 hit rate. This work is the
first of many steps toward systematically creating hardware-aware LLM
performance engineering agents.

*Erfan Darzi,Shreeanant Bharadwaj,Sree Bhargavi Balija*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a host-level controller to improve latency-sensitive inference in shared A100 clusters by addressing PCIe fabric contention issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to mitigate noisy-neighbor interference on the PCIe fabric in shared A100 clusters, which leads to inflated tail latency and increased violations of Service Level Objectives (SLOs).

Method: The method involves a host-level controller that integrates dynamic MIG reconfiguration, PCIe-aware placement, and lightweight guardrails (MPS quotas, cgroup I/O). It collects per-tenant latency data and system signals, uses topology-based heuristics to sidestep PCIe bottlenecks, and carefully times actions to prevent system instability.

Result: Experiments on single-host and 16-GPU cluster setups show that SLO miss-rate is reduced by approximately 32% and p99 latency improves by around 15% with a throughput cost of less than or equal to 5%. Tests with vLLM on OLMo 2 7B Instruct show a 10-15% p99 improvement in time-to-first-token (TTFT).

Conclusion: The proposed controller effectively reduces tail latency and improves reliability in latency-sensitive inference tasks without significant throughput penalties, making it a practical solution for shared GPU environments.

Abstract: Latency-sensitive inference on shared A100 clusters often suffers
noisy-neighbor interference on the PCIe fabric, inflating tail latency and SLO
violations. We present a fabric-agnostic, VM-deployable host-level controller
that combines dynamic Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) reconfiguration, PCIe-aware
placement, and lightweight guardrails (MPS quotas, cgroup I/O). It samples
per-tenant tails and system signals, uses topology hints to avoid PCIe hot
spots, and gates actions with dwell/cool-down to avoid thrash. On a single host
and a 2-node (16-GPU) cluster, SLO miss-rate is reduced by \(\approx\)32\%
(\(\approx\)1.5) and p99 latency improves \(\approx\)15\% with \(\leq\)5\%
throughput cost versus static MIG and naive placement; ablations show MIG and
placement contribute comparably. We also evaluate LLM serving with vLLM on OLMo
2 7B Instruct: TTFT p99 improves \(\approx\)10--15\% at \(\leq\)5\% cost
without changing the controller.

*Guanyu Xu,Zhiwei Hao,Li Shen,Yong Luo,Fuhui Sun,Xiaoyan Wang,Han Hu,Yonggang Wen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoFormer, a system for collaborative model inference on edge devices, tackling the challenges of computational demands and resource limitations posed by transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by deploying computationally intensive transformer models on resource-constrained edge devices, aiming for better trade-offs between latency, accuracy, and energy efficiency.

Method: CoFormer decomposes large transformer models into smaller components for distributed inference, aggregates intermediate results, and uses the DeBo algorithm to optimize and calibrate the models for performance.

Result: CoFormer achieves up to 3.1x inference speedup and reduces memory usage by 76.3% while enabling efficient deployment of large transformers like GPT2-XL on edge devices. Energy consumption is reduced by 40% without compromising performance.

Conclusion: CoFormer offers a practical solution for real-time transformer inference on edge devices by enabling efficient, distributed computation while balancing accuracy, speed, and resource use.

Abstract: The impressive performance of transformer models has sparked the deployment
of intelligent applications on resource-constrained edge devices. However,
ensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant
challenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource
requirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload
transformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models
on individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either
considerable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy
and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative
inference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer. The central
idea behind CoFormer is to exploit the divisibility and integrability of
transformer. An off-the-shelf large transformer can be decomposed into multiple
smaller models for distributed inference, and their intermediate results are
aggregated to generate the final output. We formulate an optimization problem
to minimize both inference latency and accuracy degradation under heterogeneous
hardware constraints. DeBo algorithm is proposed to first solve the
optimization problem to derive the decomposition policy, and then progressively
calibrate decomposed models to restore performance. We demonstrate the
capability to support a wide range of transformer models on heterogeneous edge
devices, achieving up to 3.1$\times$ inference speedup with large transformer
models. Notably, CoFormer enables the efficient inference of GPT2-XL with 1.6
billion parameters on edge devices, reducing memory requirements by 76.3\%.
CoFormer can also reduce energy consumption by approximately 40\% while
maintaining satisfactory inference performance.

### [177] [pdGRASS: A Fast Parallel Density-Aware Algorithm for Graph Spectral Sparsification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20403)
*Tiancheng Zhao,Zekun Yin,Huihai An,Xiaoyu Yang,Zhou Jin,Jiasi Shen,Helen Xu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: pdGRASS is a new parallel algorithm for Graph Spectral Sparsification that achieves significant speedups and scalability improvements over the previous state-of-the-art method feGRASS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issues with feGRASS, including difficulties in parallelizing data-dependent tasks and performance degradation on skewed input graphs.

Method: pdGRASS organizes edges into disjoint subtasks without data dependencies, thus enabling efficient parallelization and a single-pass edge recovery for Graph Spectral Sparsification.

Result: Experiments showed pdGRASS achieves average runtime speedups of 3.9x to 8.8x compared to feGRASS, mitigates worst-case scenarios by over 1000x speedup, and produces sparsifiers with PCG iteration counts ranging from 1.2x higher to 1.8x lower.

Conclusion: pdGRASS offers significant scalability and performance enhancements for spectral graph sparsification, resolving the limitations present in feGRASS.

Abstract: Graph Spectral Sparsification (GSS) identifies an ultra-sparse subgraph, or
sparsifier, whose Laplacian matrix closely approximates the spectral properties
of the original graph, enabling substantial reductions in computational
complexity for computationally intensive problems in scientific computing. The
state-of-the-art method for efficient GSS is feGRASS, consisting of two steps:
1) spanning tree generation and 2) off-tree edge recovery. However, feGRASS
suffers from two main issues: 1) difficulties in parallelizing the recovery
step for strict data dependencies, and 2) performance degradation on skewed
inputs, often requiring multiple passes to recover sufficient edges. To address
these challenges, we propose parallel density-aware Graph Spectral
Sparsification (pdGRASS), a parallel algorithm that organizes edges into
disjoint subtasks without data dependencies between them, enabling efficient
parallelization and sufficient edge recovery in a single pass. We empirically
evaluate feGRASS and pdGRASS based on 1) off-tree edge-recovery runtime and 2)
sparsifier quality, measured by the iteration count required for convergence in
a preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) application. The evaluation
demonstrates that, depending on the number of edges recovered, pdGRASS achieves
average speedups ranging from 3.9x to 8.8x. The resulting sparsifiers also show
between 1.2x higher and 1.8x lower PCG iteration counts, with further
improvements as more edges are recovered. Additionally, pdGRASS mitigates the
worst-case runtimes of feGRASS with over 1000x speedup. These results highlight
pdGRASS's significant improvements in scalability and performance for the graph
spectral sparsification problem.

*Yilin Li,Song Han,Sibo Wang,Ming Wang,Renzi Meng*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper designs a multi-agent mechanism to optimize microservice architectures and demonstrates its superior governance and operational performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Governance challenges in large-scale microservice systems due to dynamic dependencies, topologies, and fluctuating workloads.

Method: Using multi-agent collaborative evolution with graph representation learning, Markov Decision Process policies, and game-driven optimization.

Result: Experiments prove enhanced coordination, adaptability, and policy efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The method offers robust governance and operational benefits for complex microservice systems.

Abstract: This paper proposes an intelligent service optimization method based on a
multi-agent collaborative evolution mechanism to address governance challenges
in large-scale microservice architectures. These challenges include complex
service dependencies, dynamic topology structures, and fluctuating workloads.
The method models each service as an agent and introduces graph representation
learning to construct a service dependency graph. This enables agents to
perceive and embed structural changes within the system. Each agent learns its
policy based on a Markov Decision Process. A centralized training and
decentralized execution framework is used to integrate local autonomy with
global coordination. To enhance overall system performance and adaptability, a
game-driven policy optimization mechanism is designed. Through a
selection-mutation process, agent strategy distributions are dynamically
adjusted. This supports adaptive collaboration and behavioral evolution among
services. Under this mechanism, the system can quickly respond and achieve
stable policy convergence when facing scenarios such as sudden workload spikes,
topology reconfigurations, or resource conflicts. To evaluate the effectiveness
of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on a representative
microservice simulation platform. Comparative analyses are performed against
several advanced approaches, focusing on coordination efficiency, adaptability,
and policy convergence performance. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms others in several key metrics. It significantly improves
governance efficiency and operational stability in large-scale microservice
systems. The method demonstrates strong practical value and engineering
feasibility.

*Ruobing Wang,Qiaoyu Tan,Yili Wang,Ying Wang,Xin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes CrystalICL, a model for few-shot crystal generation using advances in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human experts design materials by tweaking known structures, a process akin to in-context learning (ICL). Existing LLM-based crystal generation methods lack such few-shot capabilities.

Method: CrystalICL employs space-group based tokenization for modeling crystal symmetry and hybrid instruction tuning strategies to leverage few-shot ICL.

Result: CrystalICL outperformed leading baseline methods in experiments across four crystal generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Few-shot ICL is a promising approach for crystal material design, demonstrated effectively by CrystalICL.

Abstract: Designing crystal materials with desired physicochemical properties remains a
fundamental challenge in materials science. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, existing
LLM-based crystal generation approaches are limited to zero-shot scenarios and
are unable to benefit from few-shot scenarios. In contrast, human experts
typically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which
aligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose
CrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation.
Specifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method,
which effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs.
We further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning
framework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to
better exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited
data. Extensive experiments on four crystal generation benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of CrystalICL over the leading baseline methods on conditional
and unconditional generation tasks.

*Elisha Dayag,Nhat Thanh Van Tran,Jack Xin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses adding learnable frequency filters to transformer-based models for long time-series forecasting (LTSF), offering improved performance and reduced model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models excel in LTSF but are biased towards low-frequency data and require high computational resources, prompting the need to address these limitations.

Method: The authors enhance transformer-based models by integrating learnable frequency filters at the model's input, adding minimal parameters (~1000) to improve spectral utilization.

Result: Incorporating the filters leads to 5-10% relative improvement in forecasting accuracy, allows for reduced embedding dimensions, and creates more compact and effective models.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that learnable frequency filters significantly enhance transformer-based models, making them both more accurate and efficient for long time-series forecasting.

Abstract: Transformer-based models are at the forefront in long time-series forecasting
(LTSF). While in many cases, these models are able to achieve state of the art
results, they suffer from a bias toward low-frequencies in the data and high
computational and memory requirements. Recent work has established that
learnable frequency filters can be an integral part of a deep forecasting model
by enhancing the model's spectral utilization. These works choose to use a
multilayer perceptron to process their filtered signals and thus do not solve
the issues found with transformer-based models. In this paper, we establish
that adding a filter to the beginning of transformer-based models enhances
their performance in long time-series forecasting. We add learnable filters,
which only add an additional $\approx 1000$ parameters to several
transformer-based models and observe in multiple instances 5-10 \% relative
improvement in forecasting performance. Additionally, we find that with filters
added, we are able to decrease the embedding dimension of our models, resulting
in transformer-based architectures that are both smaller and more effective
than their non-filtering base models. We also conduct synthetic experiments to
analyze how the filters enable Transformer-based models to better utilize the
full spectrum for forecasting.

TL;DR: The paper connects classical linear prediction with modern transformer models, interpreting them via probabilistic models and fixed-point updates, with a focus on hidden Markov models (HMMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between classical nonlinear filtering theory and modern inference architectures like transformers.

Method: Presents a probabilistic model interpreting transformer signals as conditional measures and describes layer operations as fixed-point updates, specifically analyzing the case with hidden Markov models (HMMs).

Result: Develops a novel interpretation of transformer operations through classical probabilistic and fixed-point frameworks.

Conclusion: The paper establishes conceptual links between traditional nonlinear filtering methods and state-of-the-art transformer architectures, providing insights into their underlying mechanisms.

Abstract: In the 1940s, Wiener introduced a linear predictor, where the future
prediction is computed by linearly combining the past data. A transformer
generalizes this idea: it is a nonlinear predictor where the next-token
prediction is computed by nonlinearly combining the past tokens. In this essay,
we present a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as
surrogates of conditional measures, and layer operations as fixed-point
updates. An explicit form of the fixed-point update is described for the
special case when the probabilistic model is a hidden Markov model (HMM). In
part, this paper is in an attempt to bridge the classical nonlinear filtering
theory with modern inference architectures.

*Johnson Zhou,Joseph West,Krista A. Ehinger,Zhenming Ren,Sam E. John,David B. Grayden*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CTXSEG, an adaptive segmentation method, and demonstrates its benefits in EEG machine learning, particularly in seizure detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fixed-time segmentation methods for EEG data may disregard the biological dynamics of brain states, potentially limiting their effectiveness in machine learning applications.

Method: The authors developed CTXSEG, a method creating variable-length EEG segments based on statistical differences. They validated it against fixed-length segmentation using synthetic data (generated by CTXGEN) and applied it to EEG seizure detection.

Result: CTXSEG outperformed fixed-length segmentation in seizure detection performance using a standardized framework. It also required fewer segments to achieve these results.

Conclusion: CTXSEG shows promise as an effective and biologically meaningful alternative to fixed-length segmentation in EEG machine learning. It is a practical and beneficial addition to preprocessing techniques.

Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling
continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals
for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The
current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited
biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.
We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine
learning EEG analysis.
  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that
creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG
data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that
typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable
synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG
method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying
it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG
with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG
machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.
  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure
detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using
a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and
requires fewer segments.
  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG
can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to
improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation
for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard
preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.

TL;DR: Knowledge Distillation (KD) effectiveness is linked to the teacher model's calibration error, and reducing this error can enhance KD's performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand which factors improve the student's performance in Knowledge Distillation and identify how calibration influences KD success.

Method: The paper analyzes the relationship between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy, and introduces calibration methods to reduce this error.

Result: Reducing the teacher model's calibration error improves Knowledge Distillation performance across diverse tasks, including classification and detection.

Conclusion: Teacher model calibration is crucial for effective KD; applying calibration methods significantly boosts the performance and can be integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression
technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large
teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant
success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving
the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation
between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore,
we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for
effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be
improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's
calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness
across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be
easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently
achieving superior performance.

Motivation: The authors aim to evaluate symbolic regression methods to identify suitable options for modeling complex phenomena in physics and other sciences.

Method: Five symbolic regression methods were benchmarked against nine dynamical processes, including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models.

Result: PySR outperformed others in predictive power and accuracy, often producing results indistinguishable from the analytical forms.

Conclusion: Symbolic regression, with PySR as a standout tool, is effective for accurately modeling real-world phenomena.

Abstract: The process of discovering equations from data lies at the heart of physics

epidemiology. Recently, machine learning methods known as symbolic regression
have automated this process. As several methods are available in the

methods were used for recovering equations from nine dynamical processes,
including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models, with the PySR method proving to
be the most suitable for inferring equations. Benchmark results demonstrate its
high predictive power and accuracy, with some estimates being indistinguishable

Method: CLD simplifies coreset selection by using per-sample loss values at training checkpoints instead of costly gradient or curvature computations, aligning training samples' loss trajectories with a validation set.

Result: CLD demonstrated efficiency and comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods, transferring effectively across architectures and maintaining stability using early checkpoints with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: CLD provides a principled, efficient, and transferable approach for scalable dataset optimization, reducing biases and eliminating stratified sampling needs.

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but
face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To
address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and
scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful
training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a
held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample
loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient
and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We
develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees
for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is
upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the
representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k,
CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art
methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally
expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across
architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with
<1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints,
incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias
reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional
stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled,
efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.

*Firooz Shahriari-Mehr,Javad Aliakbari,Alexandre Graell i Amat,Ashkan Panahi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores transductive node classification in graphs with community structures and proposes a new optimization problem that integrates node labels and features for better clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve node classification by leveraging both graph structure and node-specific information (labels and features), under less restrictive conditions compared to traditional graph clustering.

Method: The authors propose a novel optimization problem that fuses node-specific data with spectral graph clustering techniques and demonstrate its effectiveness both theoretically and experimentally.

Result: The proposed approach is proven to perfectly recover community structures under milder assumptions, and experiments validate the synergy between graph structure and node-specific data.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that combining node-specific information with graph structure leads to more accurate community recovery, expanding the potential of current graph-based classification models.

Abstract: We present an analysis of the transductive node classification problem, where
the underlying graph consists of communities that agree with the node labels
and node features. For node classification, we propose a novel optimization
problem that incorporates the node-specific information (labels and features)
in a spectral graph clustering framework. Studying this problem, we demonstrate
a synergy between the graph structure and node-specific information. In
particular, we show that suitable node-specific information guarantees the
solution of our optimization problem perfectly recovering the communities,
under milder conditions than the bounds on graph clustering alone. We present
algorithmic solutions to our optimization problem and numerical experiments
that confirm such a synergy.

### [187] [Poison Once, Refuse Forever: Weaponizing Alignment for Injecting Bias in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20333)
*Md Abdullah Al Mamun,Ihsen Alouani,Nael Abu-Ghazaleh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates a method called Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI) to exploit Large Language Models’ (LLMs) alignment mechanisms, injecting bias or censorship into the models without reducing their responses on unrelated topics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To show how adversaries can exploit alignment mechanisms of LLMs to selectively induce refusal responses, creating bias or targeted censorship.

Method: The researchers introduced an attack called SAI, which leverages alignment mechanisms to emit targeted refusals on specific topics or queries. The study evaluated its performance against current poisoning defenses and in real-world application cases.

Result: SAI bypasses existing defenses like LLM state forensics and robust aggregation strategies. The technique induced significant bias across use cases, including chat applications and resume evaluation systems, with bias measures as high as ΔDP 38%.

Conclusion: The study highlights a serious security risk in LLM alignment mechanisms, pointing to the need for improved defenses to prevent bias or censorship attacks like SAI.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety
requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In
this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to
implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's
responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive
Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment
mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the
adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced
through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to
inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning
defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation
techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate
the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on
LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as
ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare
questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of
23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume
selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected
university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher
bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.

*Neta Shoham,Haim Avron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces methods for exact stochastic inference in Gaussian Processes (GPs) that overcome limitations of existing approximation-based methods, yielding improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for learning hyperparameters in GPs are limited by approximations, resulting in potentially biased outcomes and lack of convergence guarantees.

Method: The paper proposes algorithms for exact stochastic inference of GPs using kernels that induce RKHSs of moderate finite dimension, with extensions for infinite dimensional RKHSs at the trade-off of exactness.

Result: The proposed methods outperform existing approaches, particularly under constrained memory resources affecting batch size and inducing points.

Conclusion: The algorithms provide a more reliable approach to stochastic hyperparameter learning in GPs, demonstrating stronger experimental outcomes under resource limitations.

Abstract: Current methods for stochastic hyperparameter learning in Gaussian Processes
(GPs) rely on approximations, such as computing biased stochastic gradients or
using inducing points in stochastic variational inference. However, when using
such methods we are not guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the
true marginal likelihood. In this work, we propose algorithms for exact
stochastic inference of GPs with kernels that induce a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS) of moderate finite dimension. Our approach can also be
extended to infinite dimensional RKHSs at the cost of forgoing exactness. Both
for finite and infinite dimensional RKHSs, our method achieves better
experimental results than existing methods when memory resources limit the
feasible batch size and the possible number of inducing points.

*Ralph Bulanadi,Jawad Chowdhury,Funakubo Hiroshi,Maxim Ziatdinov,Rama Vasudevan,Arpan Biswas,Yongtao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces INS2ANE, a novel framework that enhances autonomous experiments (AEs) by focusing on discovering novel phenomena instead of just optimizing predefined targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to go beyond the current limitation of AEs, which primarily optimize predefined targets, by enabling the discovery of unexpected or unknown physical phenomena.

Method: INS2ANE comprises two components: a novelty scoring system for assessing the uniqueness of results and a strategic sampling mechanism to explore under-sampled spaces.

Result: The framework was validated on a dataset with known outcomes and in autonomous scanning probe microscopy experiments, significantly improving the diversity of phenomena explored.

Conclusion: INS2ANE advances autonomous experimentation by enhancing the discovery of new phenomena, thus accelerating scientific research by efficiently navigating complex experimental landscapes.

Abstract: Autonomous experiments (AEs) are transforming how scientific research is
conducted by integrating artificial intelligence with automated experimental
platforms. Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined
target; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of
unexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework,
INS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration),
to enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our
method integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that
evaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling
mechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they
appear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a
pre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral
pairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy
experiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored
phenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the
likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results
demonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery;
in combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to
accelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex
experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.

### [190] [Dimension Agnostic Testing of Survey Data Credibility through the Lens of Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20616)
*Debabrota Basu,Sourav Chakraborty,Debarshi Chanda,Buddha Dev Das,Arijit Ghosh,Arnab Ray*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a task-based approach to assess the credibility of survey data using a model-specific distance metric, with an efficient algorithm whose sample complexity is independent of data dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Survey data often represent high-dimensional distributions, making it challenging to validate their credibility due to sample size requirements. Ensuring credible data is essential for accurate downstream analysis and conclusions.

Method: A new model-specific distance metric is defined to measure credibility. Additionally, the paper presents an efficient algorithm for credibility verification in regression contexts, avoiding dependence on data dimensionality.

Result: The proposed algorithm demonstrates theoretical correctness and outperforms traditional methods in numerical experiments, maintaining credibility assessment efficiency even with high-dimensional data.

Conclusion: The method offers a dimension-independent sample complexity solution for verifying survey data credibility, representing a substantial advancement over traditional reconstruction-based verification approaches.

Abstract: Assessing whether a sample survey credibly represents the population is a
critical question for ensuring the validity of downstream research. Generally,
this problem reduces to estimating the distance between two high-dimensional
distributions, which typically requires a number of samples that grows
exponentially with the dimension. However, depending on the model used for data
analysis, the conclusions drawn from the data may remain consistent across
different underlying distributions. In this context, we propose a task-based
approach to assess the credibility of sampled surveys. Specifically, we
introduce a model-specific distance metric to quantify this notion of
credibility. We also design an algorithm to verify the credibility of survey
data in the context of regression models. Notably, the sample complexity of our
algorithm is independent of the data dimension. This efficiency stems from the
fact that the algorithm focuses on verifying the credibility of the survey data
rather than reconstructing the underlying regression model. Furthermore, we
show that if one attempts to verify credibility by reconstructing the
regression model, the sample complexity scales linearly with the dimensionality
of the data. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithm and
numerically demonstrate our algorithm's performance.

*Xinli Shi,Xingxing Yuan,Longkang Zhu,Guanghui Wen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents TV-HSGT, a novel algorithm for distributed online optimization that performs well in dynamic environments without assuming bounded gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed online optimization is critical for real-time decision-making, but existing methods struggle with stochastic gradients and time-varying networks.

Method: The authors introduce TV-HSGT, which uses hybrid stochastic gradient tracking, variance reduction, and combines row-stochastic and column-stochastic schemes.

Result: Theoretical and experimental findings show improved dynamic regret bounds and its effectiveness in logistic regression tasks.

Conclusion: TV-HSGT is a robust solution for distributed online optimization in dynamic settings without gradient boundedness assumptions.

Abstract: With the increasing scale and dynamics of data, distributed online
optimization has become essential for real-time decision-making in various
applications. However, existing algorithms often rely on bounded gradient
assumptions and overlook the impact of stochastic gradients, especially in
time-varying directed networks. This study proposes a novel Time-Varying Hybrid
Stochastic Gradient Tracking algorithm named TV-HSGT, based on hybrid
stochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms. Specifically,
TV-HSGT integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes
over time-varying digraphs, eliminating the need for Perron vector estimation
or out-degree information. By combining current and recursive stochastic
gradients, it effectively reduces gradient variance while accurately tracking
global descent directions. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TV-HSGT can
achieve improved bounds on dynamic regret without assuming gradient
boundedness. Experimental results on logistic regression tasks confirm the
effectiveness of TV-HSGT in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve Independent Component Analysis (ICA) by leveraging multi-trial supervision to enhance the success rate in non-convex optimization and improve interpretability.

Method: A proximal gradient-type algorithm combined with joint learning of a prediction model through backpropagation is used. Both synthetic and real data experiments are conducted.

Result: The integration of multi-trial supervision led to increased success rates in non-convex optimization tasks and improved interpretability of the independent components.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances ICA with additional supervision, making it more effective in optimization and component interpretability.

Abstract: We develop a stochastic algorithm for independent component analysis that
incorporates multi-trial supervision, which is available in many scientific
contexts. The method blends a proximal gradient-type algorithm in the space of
invertible matrices with joint learning of a prediction model through
backpropagation. We illustrate the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real
data experiments. In particular, owing to the additional supervision, we
observe an increased success rate of the non-convex optimization and the
improved interpretability of the independent components.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework that combines latent variable modeling with double machine learning (DML) for better causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of unobserved or hidden factors in causal inference, which can bias treatment or outcome analyses in observational data.

Method: The authors integrate latent variable modeling into the second stage of the double machine learning (DML) framework. They separate representation learning from latent variable inference to keep the approach tractable.

Result: Through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, the proposed method demonstrated robust and effective causal effect estimation in scenarios with hidden factors.

Conclusion: Integrating latent variable models in the DML paradigm offers a practical and robust solution for improving causal effect estimation when hidden influences are present.

Abstract: Latent variable models provide a powerful framework for incorporating and
inferring unobserved factors in observational data. In causal inference, they
help account for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome, thereby
addressing challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates. This paper
proposes a new framework that integrates latent variable modeling into the
double machine learning (DML) paradigm to enable robust causal effect
estimation in the presence of such hidden factors. We consider two scenarios:
one where a latent variable affects only the outcome, and another where it may
influence both treatment and outcome. To ensure tractability, we incorporate
latent variables only in the second stage of DML, separating representation
learning from latent inference. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness
of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

*Sam Houliston,Ambroise Odonnat,Charles Arnal,Vivien Cabannes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that tool-augmented language models outperform memory-based models in factual recall, both theoretically and empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the theoretical advantages of tool-augmented language models, specifically comparing external tool use (retrieval) against in-memory memorization for factual recall.

Method: The authors analyze the parameter limits of memorization in models, prove unbounded factual recall via external retrieval, and conduct controlled experiments to validate their findings.

Result: Tool-using models consistently outperform memory-based models in factual recall tasks, and teaching tool-use is more effective than finetuning large language models for memorization.

Conclusion: Tool-augmented workflows are not only practical but also provably more scalable and efficient for large language models.

Abstract: Tool-augmented language models, equipped with retrieval, memory, or external
APIs, are reshaping AI, yet their theoretical advantages remain underexplored.
In this paper, we address this question by demonstrating the benefits of
in-tool learning (external retrieval) over in-weight learning (memorization)
for factual recall. We show that the number of facts a model can memorize
solely in its weights is fundamentally limited by its parameter count. In
contrast, we prove that tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via a simple
and efficient circuit construction. These results are validated in controlled
experiments, where tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing ones.
We further show that for pretrained large language models, teaching tool-use
and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory. Our work
provides both a theoretical and empirical foundation, establishing why
tool-augmented workflows are not just practical, but provably more scalable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the theoretical underpinnings of Subsampled Natural Gradient Descent (SNGD) and its accelerated variant SPRING, showing their equivalence to regularized and accelerated Kaczmarz methods in specific optimization contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNGD has demonstrated notable success in parametric optimization tasks but has lacked theoretical insights explaining its efficacy.

Method: The study analyzes SNGD and SPRING in idealized settings using randomized linear algebra, proving their equivalence to variants of the Kaczmarz method under specific conditions.

Result: The paper provides fast convergence guarantees for SNGD, establishes SPRING's effectiveness and acceleration property, and extends applicability beyond least-squares problems.

Conclusion: The findings offer the first theoretical explanation for SNGD's effectiveness, highlighting the role of subsampling and curvature-sensitive optimization in achieving fast convergence rates.

Abstract: Subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) has shown impressive results for
parametric optimization tasks in scientific machine learning, such as neural
network wavefunctions and physics-informed neural networks, but it has lacked a
theoretical explanation. We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of
SNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization
problems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and
quadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard
linear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized
Kaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized
Kaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under
mild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first
convergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that
SPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic
loss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a
fast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first
explanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.
Overall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can
shed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware
optimization strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the potential of LLMs to handle complex and high-dimensional genetic data, addressing challenges faced by traditional methods.

Method: An automated keyword search was conducted across multiple databases to identify relevant studies on LLM applications in genetic diagnostics and education. A total of 172 studies were reviewed.

Result: The study finds significant advancements in genomic variant identification, annotation, medical imaging, and report generation using transformer-based models. However, integration of multimodal data and practical clinical implementation remain challenging.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in hereditary disease diagnostics and genetic education by transforming various processes, but further work is needed to improve generalizability and clinical applicability.

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have
contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease
diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge
now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models
(LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring
contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review
examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare
and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv,
medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in
diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated
models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in
genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as
medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate
that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk
stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report
generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic
sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust
pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation
in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and
assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming
hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unpredictable local performance in neural networks limits reliability in critical applications.

Method: Defined the VC metric to measure local value changes; examined its theoretical properties and introduced a preprocessing framework using this metric.

Result: Numerical experiments, including PDE-related cases, validated the utility of VC and the associated preprocessing framework.

Conclusion: VC enhances understanding and stability of neural network approximations, improving reliability and preprocessing efficiency in practical scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduce a novel metric of an objective function f, we say VC
(value change) to measure the difficulty and approximation affection when
conducting an neural network approximation task, and it numerically supports
characterizing the local performance and behavior of neural network
approximation. Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local
performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC
addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes
in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for
achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental
theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural
network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends
respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the
distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a
novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions
from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further
propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation.
Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related
scientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration

### [199] [Beacon: Post-Training Quantization with Integrated Grid Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20293)
*Shihao Zhang,Rayan Saab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Beacon," an algorithm for per-channel post-training quantization that automatically determines optimal scaling factors without manual tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization helps reduce the memory and computation burden of large neural models, but existing methods struggle with manually tuning scaling factors for efficient quantization.

Method: The authors propose Beacon, an algorithm that avoids manual tuning by using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and exploiting symmetric scalar quantization geometry to automatically find optimal scaling factors.

Result: Beacon offers competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods for both symmetric and asymmetric quantization, without requiring back-propagation or large calibration datasets.

Conclusion: Beacon simplifies quantization processes by eliminating manual scale tuning while maintaining high performance, making it an effective tool for model deployment.

Abstract: Quantization is a widely used compression technique for reducing the memory
and computation costs of large pre-trained models. A key challenge in
per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) is selecting appropriate scaling
factors to replace weight values with values from a scaled quantization grid.
Existing methods typically fix the scale at the outset via heuristic tuning or
grid search. In this note, we propose Beacon, a simple and effective algorithm
that eliminates the need for such manual tuning. Beacon performs per-channel
PTQ directly using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines the
optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar
quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with
minimal modifications and does not rely on back-propagation or large
calibration sets. Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making
it a practical solution for efficient model deployment.

*Frank Röder,Jan Benad,Manfred Eppe,Pradeep Kr. Banerjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DALI, a framework for handling unseen environmental conditions in reinforcement learning using latent context representations, achieving strong zero-shot generalization and surpassing baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the limitations of existing methods for dealing with unseen environmental conditions in reinforcement learning, especially when context variables are latent or difficult to measure.

Method: The proposed method, DALI, employs a self-supervised encoder within the Dreamer architecture to infer latent context representations by predicting forward dynamics from agent-environment interactions. These representations condition the world model and policy for improved decision-making.

Result: DALI showcases significant improvements over context-unaware baselines and even surpasses some context-aware methods in extrapolation tasks. It demonstrates zero-shot generalization to novel contextual variations.

Conclusion: The results validate DALI's latent context inference and its ability to bridge perception and control, thus enabling robust and efficient handling of unseen environmental contexts in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning demands adaptation to unseen environmental
conditions without costly retraining. Contextual Markov Decision Processes
(cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit
context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts
are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination
(DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers
latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training
a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates
actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging
perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for
efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space
enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension
alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP
benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines,
often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling
zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel method for fine-tuning hidden representations in Federated Learning (FL) to address challenges like data heterogeneity and computational limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) for Federated Learning, considering the challenges posed by heterogeneous client data and resource constraints.

Method: FedReFT uses sparse intervention layers to fine-tune hidden representations directly via a new aggregation strategy called All-But-Me (ABM). ABM allows personalized learning by balancing local and global knowledge.

Result: FedReFT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT approaches in FL tasks, offering higher parameter efficiency (7x-15x better than leading LoRA-based methods) and better performance across multiple evaluation tasks.

Conclusion: FedReFT is a lightweight and effective approach for Federated Learning, solving the issues of semantic alignment and heterogeneity while delivering parameter-efficient fine-tuning suitable for edge devices.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention
for adapting large pre-trained models by modifying a small subset of
parameters. Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an
effective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model
weights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich
semantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in
standalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL)
remains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model
capacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we
introduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to
fine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse
intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a
lightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge
devices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to
aggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging
can corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me
(ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others
and partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by
balancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense
reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x
higher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.

Abstract: The growing complexity of urban mobility and the demand for efficient,
sustainable, and adaptive solutions have positioned Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core
of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large
scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals,
autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these
challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies
that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper
presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a
structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination
models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor
critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across
key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous
vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems.
Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA,
and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks.
The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non
stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real
transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.

### [203] [Multi-View Graph Convolution Network for Internal Talent Recommendation Based on Enterprise Emails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20328)
*Soo Hyun Kim,Jang-Hyun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Dual Graph Convolutional Network leveraging email data to recommend internal talent, fusing task-related and collaboration-related insights. It outperforms conventional methods, achieving high interpretability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional talent recommendation systems focus narrowly on a few managers' perspectives, leading to oversight of qualified candidates. The paper aims to resolve this limitation by leveraging new metrics.

Method: The framework extracts two dimensions—the nature of tasks (semantic similarity) and work style (collaboration)—as graphs derived from email data. These are fused adaptively using a Dual Graph Convolutional Network with a gating mechanism.

Result: The proposed model greatly outperforms baseline heuristics and alternative fusion methods, reaching 40.9% on Hit@100. It also exhibits high interpretability by customizing fusion strategies for different job families.

Conclusion: This research provides a comprehensive, data-driven framework for internal talent discovery, optimizing task alignment and collaboration metrics to reduce candidate omission risks. It offers a flexible and practical approach adaptable to various organizational needs.

Abstract: Internal talent recommendation is a critical strategy for organizational
continuity, yet conventional approaches suffer from structural limitations,
often overlooking qualified candidates by relying on the narrow perspective of
a few managers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that
models two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data:
WHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural
characteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are
represented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our
proposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion
strategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on
Hit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high
interpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for
different job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW)
data for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach
for 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and
comprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of
candidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution
lies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between
task alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for
employees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical
implications.

*Zohair Shafi,Serdar Kadioglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Forge introduces a pre-trained vector-quantized graph autoencoder to learn representations of mixed-integer programming instances without requiring solutions, demonstrating wide applicability across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accelerate combinatorial optimization problem solving while reducing dependency on computationally expensive training data generation and improving scalability/generalization of learning-based models.

Method: Forge employs unsupervised pre-training using a vector-quantized graph autoencoder to generate embeddings for optimization instances, enabling clustering and improving predictions in various supervised tasks.

Result: Unsupservised: Forge embeddings excel at clustering and distinguishing unseen optimization instances. Supservised: Fine-tuned Forge embeddings improve variable prediction and integrality gap estimation, boosting solver performance.

Conclusion: Forge improves scalability in learning-based optimization by introducing unified embeddings for diverse tasks, and provides pre-trained models for further research integration.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and
engineering, yet learning-based approaches to accelerate their solution often
require solving a large number of hard-to-solve optimization instances to
collect training data, incurring significant computational overhead. Existing
methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution for
each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization.
In this work, we introduce Forge, a method of pre-training a vector-quantized
graph autoencoder on a large and diverse collection of mixed-integer
programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised fashion without dependency on
their solution. The vector quantization process creates discrete code
assignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We
evaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the
unsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively
differentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we
fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the
variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across
multiple problem type distributions. Both predictions help improve performance
of a state-of-the-art, commercial optimization solver. Finally, we release our
code and pre-trained Forge weights to encourage further research and practical
use of instance-level MIP embeddings at https://github.com/skadio/forge/

### [205] [Dynamic Synthetic Controls vs. Panel-Aware Double Machine Learning for Geo-Level Marketing Impact Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20335)
*Sang Su Lee,Vineeth Loganathan,Vijay Raghavan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates marketing lift methods in two-sided marketplaces, comparing Synthetic Control Method (SCM) and Double Machine Learning (DML). DML variants outperform SCM under challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately measuring the impact of marketing campaigns in regional markets, especially under complex dynamics like nonlinear trends and external shocks, demands advanced and reliable analytical methods.

Method: An open simulator was developed to mimic geo roll-outs and stress-tested seven estimators (ASC variants and DML models) under five challenging scenarios. These estimators were assessed through 100 replications per scenario.

Result: Augmented Synthetic Control models exhibited severe biases and low confidence interval coverage in complex setups. DML variants significantly reduced biases and achieved reliable coverage, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: A 'diagnose-first' framework is proposed, recommending the use of DML models tailored to specific challenges, promoting robustness and reliability in geo-experiment analyses.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is
challenging: the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) often exhibits high power yet
systematically under-estimates effect size, while panel-style Double Machine
Learning (DML) is seldom benchmarked against SCM. We build an open, fully
documented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out: N_unit
regional markets are tracked for T_pre weeks before launch and for a further
T_post-week campaign window, allowing all key parameters to be varied by the
user and probe both families under five stylized stress tests: 1) curved
baseline trends, 2) heterogeneous response lags, 3) treated-biased shocks, 4) a
non-linear outcome link, and 5) a drifting control group trend.
  Seven estimators are evaluated: three standard Augmented SCM (ASC) variants
and four panel-DML flavors (TWFE, CRE/Mundlak, first-difference, and
within-group). Across 100 replications per scenario, ASC models consistently
demonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios
involving nonlinearities or external shocks. By contrast, panel-DML variants
dramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage, proving far
more robust.
  The results indicate that while ASC provides a simple baseline, it is
unreliable in common, complex situations. We therefore propose a
'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary
business challenge (e.g., nonlinear trends, response lags) and then select the
specific DML model best suited for that scenario, providing a more robust and
reliable blueprint for analyzing geo-experiments.

### [206] [Understanding Incremental Learning with Closed-form Solution to Gradient Flow on Overparamerterized Matrix Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20344)
*Hancheng Min,René Vidal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the incremental learning phenomenon during gradient flow (GF) training in symmetric matrix factorization, showing how time-scale separation leads to sequential learning of singular values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the implicit bias in first-order optimization algorithms during neural network training, particularly the incremental learning phenomenon seen during GF.

Method: The authors analyzed GF behavior in symmetric matrix factorization, using a closed-form solution derived from a Riccati-like matrix differential equation to uncover time-scale separation effects.

Result: Incremental learning occurs due to time-scale separations among dynamics of various components in the target matrix; decreasing initialization scale amplifies this separation, aiding low-rank approximation.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into GF dynamics in symmetric matrix factorization and pave the way for analysis extensions to asymmetric cases.

Abstract: Many theoretical studies on neural networks attribute their excellent
empirical performance to the implicit bias or regularization induced by
first-order optimization algorithms when training networks under certain
initialization assumptions. One example is the incremental learning phenomenon
in gradient flow (GF) on an overparamerterized matrix factorization problem
with small initialization: GF learns a target matrix by sequentially learning
its singular values in decreasing order of magnitude over time. In this paper,
we develop a quantitative understanding of this incremental learning behavior
for GF on the symmetric matrix factorization problem, using its closed-form
solution obtained by solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation. We
show that incremental learning emerges from some time-scale separation among
dynamics corresponding to learning different components in the target matrix.
By decreasing the initialization scale, these time-scale separations become
more prominent, allowing one to find low-rank approximations of the target
matrix. Lastly, we discuss the possible avenues for extending this analysis to
asymmetric matrix factorization problems.

*Zhibang Yang,Xinke Jiang,Rihong Qiu,Ruiqing Li,Yihang Zhang,Yue Fang,Yongxin Xu,Hongxin Ding,Xu Chu,Junfeng Zhao,Yasha Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DFAMS, a framework that enhances Federated Retrieval (FR) by leveraging dynamic information flow for better document retrieval in distributed and ambiguous queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of existing federated retrieval methods, which struggle with ambiguous queries and cross-domain scenarios, reducing effectiveness in supporting downstream tasks.

Method: DFAMS identifies latent query intents and constructs knowledge partitions using dynamic information flow and gradient signals. It also trains an alignment module with multi-prototype contrastive learning for fine-grained and inter-source semantic alignment.

Result: DFAMS achieves up to 14.37% higher knowledge classification accuracy, 5.38% better retrieval recall, and 6.45% improved downstream QA accuracy across five benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework significantly improves federated retrieval quality, especially in complex scenarios, making it a more effective approach for distributed knowledge sourcing.

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge
sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge
is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and
relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios,
which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream
generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS,
a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and
construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval
across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by
leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley
value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent
recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to
train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling
fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across
knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS
outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification
accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy,
demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

*Abhishek Indupally,Satchit Ramnath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multimodal machine-learning (MMML) framework to predict hood frame geometry performance metrics efficiently, reducing simulation time and enhancing engineering design processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide designers a faster way to evaluate hood frame geometries without spending extensive time on computational simulations, thus improving efficiency in engineering design workflows.

Method: The researchers developed a MMML architecture that learns from multiple data modalities to predict performance metrics. It was tested on both known and unseen hood frame geometries to demonstrate its generalization potential.

Result: The study showed that the proposed MMML approach outperforms single-modality methods and demonstrated its ability to make accurate predictions on unseen geometries, proving its efficacy in accelerating design exploration.

Conclusion: MMML has strong potential to complement traditional simulation-based engineering workflows, especially in the early conceptual design phase, and can facilitate faster, high-quality design cycles in structural development.

Abstract: Is there a way for a designer to evaluate the performance of a given hood
frame geometry without spending significant time on simulation setup? This
paper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal
machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different modalities of
the same data to predict performance metrics. It also aims to use the MMML
architecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by
reducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed
architecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while
maintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase.
The study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data
modalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new
frame geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for
prediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize
to unseen frame models. The findings underscore MMML's potential in
supplementing traditional simulation-based workflows, particularly in the
conceptual design phase, and highlight its role in bridging the gap between
machine learning and real-world engineering applications. This research paves
the way for the broader adoption of machine learning techniques in engineering
design, with a focus on refining multimodal approaches to optimize structural
development and accelerate the design cycle.

*Guillaume Guy,Mihajlo Grbovic,Chun How Tan,Han Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BiListing, a method using large-language models and pretrained language-image models to interpret unstructured data on Airbnb listings, improving search rankings and generating revenue gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for analyzing Airbnb listings primarily relied on structured data, underutilizing valuable information in unstructured text (e.g., reviews) and images due to the complexity of processing such data. The rise of representation learning motivates a better way to extract insights and improve recommendations.

Method: The paper proposes BiListing, which aligns text and image data using large-language models and pretrained language-image models to create unified embeddings for each listing. This method supports text and image integration, allowing for advanced search capabilities and overcoming cold-start challenges.

Result: The implementation of BiListing in Airbnb's search ranking model resulted in a 0.425% NDCB gain and drove tens of millions in additional revenue.

Conclusion: BiListing demonstrates that using advanced embedding techniques can efficiently integrate unstructured multimodal data, significantly improving search ranking performance and business outcomes for Airbnb.

Abstract: Airbnb is a leader in offering travel accommodations. Airbnb has historically
relied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests
due to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from
extracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of
representation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has
become easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text
documents and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between
listings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.
  However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images,
various unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews,
making this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to
combine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a
single representation.
  This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text
and photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained
language-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable
characteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per
listing and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory
efficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and
enabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both.
  We conducted offline and online tests to leverage the BiListing embeddings in
the Airbnb search ranking model, and successfully deployed it in production,
achieved 0.425% of NDCB gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental
revenue.

*Shijie Wang,Lei Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces TF-TransUNet1D, a deep learning model designed to denoise ECG signals by combining local and long-range feature extraction using U-Net and Transformer architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to improve the diagnostic reliability of ECG signals for cardiac digital twins, which are often affected by noise and artifacts.

Method: The work proposes TF-TransUNet1D, using an encoder-decoder framework integrated with a Transformer. It employs a dual-domain loss function that optimizes both time-domain and frequency-domain signal fidelity.

Result: The model, evaluated on datasets like MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and NSTDB, showed better denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with metrics such as a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9540.

Conclusion: TF-TransUNet1D effectively enhances ECG signal fidelity, making it significant for reliable real-time monitoring and personalized cardiac modeling.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve as a foundational data source for
cardiac digital twins, yet their diagnostic utility is frequently compromised
by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose TF-TransUNet1D, a
novel one-dimensional deep neural network that integrates a U-Net-based
encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder, guided by a hybrid
time-frequency domain loss. The model is designed to simultaneously capture
local morphological features and long-range temporal dependencies, which are
critical for preserving the diagnostic integrity of ECG signals. To enhance
denoising robustness, we introduce a dual-domain loss function that jointly
optimizes waveform reconstruction in the time domain and spectral fidelity in
the frequency domain. In particular, the frequency-domain component effectively
suppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the
signal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform
components. We evaluate TF-TransUNet1D using synthetically corrupted signals
from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Noise Stress Test Database
(NSTDB). Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate
consistent superiority of our model in terms of SNR improvement and error
metrics, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation
coefficient of 0.9540. By delivering high-precision denoising, this work
bridges a critical gap in pre-processing pipelines for cardiac digital twins,
enabling more reliable real-time monitoring and personalized modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TLinFormer, a linear attention architecture, aimed at overcoming the quadratic complexity bottleneck of standard Transformers while ensuring comparable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address Transformers' quadratic complexity scaling, which limits their application in long-sequence tasks.

Method: TLinFormer reconfigures neuron connections to achieve linear complexity and exact attention while maintaining awareness of the historical context.

Result: Through experiments, TLinFormer showed improvements in inference latency, KV cache efficiency, memory usage, and speedup compared to standard Transformers in long-sequence tasks.

Conclusion: TLinFormer provides a strict linear complexity solution without sacrificing attention score accuracy or performance on long-sequence inference tasks.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial
intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity
bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting
its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing
linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on
data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This
paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the
topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear
attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection
patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact
attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full
historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent
between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a
series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer
against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The
results demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key
metrics such as \textbf{inference latency}, \textbf{KV cache efficiency},
\textbf{memory footprint}, and \textbf{overall speedup}.

### [212] [Assessing local deformation and computing scalar curvature with nonlinear conformal regularization of decoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20413)
*Benjamin Couéraud,Vikram Sunkara,Christof Schütte*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a nonlinear conformal regularization for autoencoders, enhancing dimensionality reduction and local geometric understanding through conformal factor and scalar curvature computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dimensionality reduction is important for simplifying high-dimensional data and discovering main explanatory factors. Autoencoders are widely used for such tasks.

Method: The authors propose a geometric regularization method for decoding maps in autoencoders, using nonlinear conformal regularization that includes a conformal factor and enables scalar curvature computation.

Result: Through experiments on Swiss roll and CelebA datasets, the method illustrates the ability to measure local deformation (via conformal factor) and compute scalar curvature of the latent manifold.

Conclusion: Nonlinear conformal regularization offers a powerful tool to better understand geometric properties of latent spaces in dimensionality reduction applications.

Abstract: One aim of dimensionality reduction is to discover the main factors that
explain the data, and as such is paramount to many applications. When working
with high dimensional data, autoencoders offer a simple yet effective approach
to learn low-dimensional representations. The two components of a general
autoencoder consist first of an encoder that maps the observed data onto a
latent space; and second a decoder that maps the latent space back to the
original observation space, which allows to learn a low-dimensional manifold
representation of the original data. In this article, we introduce a new type
of geometric regularization for decoding maps approximated by deep neural
networks, namely nonlinear conformal regularization. This regularization
procedure permits local variations of the decoder map and comes with a new
scalar field called conformal factor which acts as a quantitative indicator of
the amount of local deformation sustained by the latent space when mapped into
the original data space. We also show that this regularization technique allows
the computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold. Implementation
and experiments on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets are performed to
illustrate how to obtain these quantities from the architecture.

### [213] [Train-Once Plan-Anywhere Kinodynamic Motion Planning via Diffusion Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21001)
*Yaniv Hassidof,Tom Jurgenson,Kiril Solovey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Diffusion Tree (DiTree), a novel kinodynamic motion planning framework combining learning-based diffusion policies (DPs) with sampling-based planners (SBPs) for efficient and reliable trajectory planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of traditional sampling-based planners (slow exploration due to uninformed action sampling) and learning-based approaches (poor generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios and lack of safety guarantees) in kinodynamic motion planning.

Method: DiTree integrates diffusion policies (DPs) as informed samplers within sampling-based planners (SBPs) to guide state-space exploration. The approach ensures generalizability and safety by combining the DP's ability to model expert trajectory distributions with the completeness of SBPs.

Result: The proposed DiTree achieves runtimes comparable to standalone diffusion policies and is three times faster than classical sampling-based planners. It also enhances the average success rate by roughly 30%, performing well on out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: DiTree effectively combines the strengths of DPs and SBPs to deliver safe, efficient, and generalizable solutions for kinodynamic motion planning, outperforming existing methods in both speed and success rate.

Abstract: Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free
trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical
problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the
robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action
propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and
solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due
to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield
significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,
thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree
(DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion
policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search
within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of
expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness
of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation
iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an
implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler
trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD
scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than
classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.
DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other
approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate. Project webpage:

*Michael Widener,Kausik Lakkaraju,John Aydin,Biplav Srivastava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Researchers assess time-series forecasting models' performance and interpretability across four datasets, revealing varied strengths depending on domain characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the success and limitations of time-series forecasting models, especially given their impact on real-world decisions.

Method: Integrating explainable AI techniques with a Rating Driven Explanations framework, evaluating four model types across diverse datasets.

Result: Feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) outperform foundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile domains, while foundation models excel in stable/trend-driven ones.

Conclusion: The suitability of time-series models depends on domain characteristics, with implications for choosing models in real-world applications.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting models (TSFM) have evolved from classical statistical
methods to sophisticated foundation models, yet understanding why and when
these models succeed or fail remains challenging. Despite this known
limitation, time series forecasting models are increasingly used to generate
information that informs real-world actions with equally real consequences.
Understanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of
these models then becomes a valuable endeavor to combat serious concerns about
how users should interact with and rely on these models' outputs. This work
addresses these concerns by combining traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods
with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess TSFM performance and
interpretability across diverse domains and use cases. We evaluate four
distinct model architectures: ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos (time-series
specific foundation model), Llama (general-purpose; both fine-tuned and base
models) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy,
transportation, and automotive sales domains. In doing so, we demonstrate that
feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform
foundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power,
car parts) while providing more interpretable explanations, whereas foundation
models excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).

Motivation: The motivation is to understand and optimize diagonal SSM initialization schemes, which are efficient alternatives to the HiPPO framework, and address gaps in explicitly studying the role of diagonal variants.

Method: The paper systematically examines diagonal SSMs using frequency analysis to uncover learning biases and proposes a new initialization method in the discrete Fourier domain termed S4D-DFouT.

Result: The proposed S4D-DFouT initialization method achieves state-of-the-art performance on Long Range Arena benchmarks and enables large-scale training on datasets like PathX-256.

Conclusion: Diagonal SSM initializations, particularly in the discrete Fourier domain, are powerful and scalable, yielding significant improvements for training on large and complex datasets.

Abstract: Current methods for initializing state space models (SSMs) parameters mainly
rely on the \textit{HiPPO framework}, which is based on an online approximation
of orthogonal polynomials. Recently, diagonal alternatives have shown to reach
a similar level of performance while being significantly more efficient due to
the simplification in the kernel computation. However, the \textit{HiPPO
framework} does not explicitly study the role of its diagonal variants. In this
paper, we take a further step to investigate the role of diagonal SSM
initialization schemes from the frequency perspective. Our work seeks to
systematically understand how to parameterize these models and uncover the
learning biases inherent in such diagonal state-space models. Based on our
observations, we propose a diagonal initialization on the discrete Fourier
domain \textit{S4D-DFouT}. The insights in the role of pole placing in the
initialization enable us to further scale them and achieve state-of-the-art
results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, allowing us to train from scratch on
very large datasets as PathX-256.

### [216] [Towards Mitigating Excessive Forgetting in LLM Unlearning via Entanglement-Aware Unlearning with Proxy Constraint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20443)
*Zhihao Liu,Jian Lou,Yuke Hu,Xiaochen Li,Tailun Chen,Yitian Chen,Zhan Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EAGLE-PC, a framework designed to effectively remove specific data from large language models without full retraining, addressing both under-forgetting and over-forgetting issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the privacy and ownership concerns linked to large language models, where data owners may require their data to be removed without impacting the model's utility.

Method: The method introduces EAGLE-PC, which combines entanglement-aware loss reweighting (to adaptively measure forgetting effort) and a proxy constraint (using in-context learning generated test data to prevent over-forgetting).

Result: EAGLE-PC demonstrates improved forgetting-utility trade-off across benchmarks like TOFU and MUSE, and nearly matches the performance of full retraining when combined with the NPO+GD optimizer.

Conclusion: The proposed solution, EAGLE-PC, provides a scalable and efficient framework for machine unlearning, addressing key challenges in balancing privacy concerns and model utility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include
private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns,
data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine
unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific
data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound
forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving
residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of
degraded utility.
  In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss
Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses
these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness
guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by
measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling
more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging
ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting
process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with
existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement.
We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent
improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined
with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering
a scalable and robust unlearning solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for privacy-compliant synthetic data generation, especially in regulated domains like healthcare and finance, where real-world data usage is restricted.

Method: A unified benchmark was developed and employed to evaluate the text datasets generated using state-of-the-art privacy-preserving techniques across five domain-specific datasets under formal Differential Privacy guarantees with realistic constraints.

Result: The evaluation highlighted significant utility and fidelity losses in synthetic datasets when strict privacy constraints were applied, emphasizing current methods' limitations in these scenarios.

Conclusion: Advanced privacy-preserving data-sharing methods are required, and this benchmark provides a precedent for realistic evaluations in this domain.

Abstract: Generative AI offers transformative potential for high-stakes domains such as
healthcare and finance, yet privacy and regulatory barriers hinder the use of
real-world data. To address this, differentially private synthetic data
generation has emerged as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce a
unified benchmark to systematically evaluate the utility and fidelity of text
datasets generated under formal Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. Our
benchmark addresses key challenges in domain-specific benchmarking, including
choice of representative data and realistic privacy budgets, accounting for
pre-training and a variety of evaluation metrics. We assess state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving generation methods across five domain-specific datasets,
revealing significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data,
especially under strict privacy constraints. These findings underscore the
limitations of current approaches, outline the need for advanced
privacy-preserving data sharing methods and set a precedent regarding their
evaluation in realistic scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) to enhance predictive modeling capabilities using Electronic Health Records (EHR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based methods for EHR fail to capture higher-order dependencies and are limited by localized message-passing schemes.

Method: It introduces the SHGT framework leveraging hypergraph structural encoding, Transformer reasoning over hypergraphs, and a tailored hypergraph reconstruction loss function.

Result: SHGT achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction using real-world EHR datasets.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that SHGT effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods, providing an improved approach to predictive modeling for EHR.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) systematically organize patient health data
through standardized medical codes, serving as a comprehensive and invaluable
source for predictive modeling. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated
effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR.
However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on
pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in
clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits
representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold
ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order
interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture
to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function
incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original
structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.

TL;DR: MedGR$^2$ introduces a framework for medical AI that generates high-quality data for training Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning, overcoming data scarcity issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical challenge in medical AI: the scarcity of expert-annotated data limiting VLMs' performance and generalization.

Method: Develop a co-evolving data generator and reward model within the MedGR$^2$ framework. Use this generated data for supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: MedGR$^2$ achieves superior results in medical reasoning tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art RL methods and generalizing across modalities and tasks with fewer parameters than large foundational models.

Conclusion: MedGR$^2$ transforms data scarcity issues into data generation opportunities, establishes a paradigm shift in medical AI, and enhances RL's generalization for high-stakes domains.

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on
unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising
alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this
data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward
Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a
self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a
reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality,
multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT
and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data
already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets.
Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and
cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based
methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves
performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more
parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in
high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data
generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly
generalizable medical AI.

*Yang Luo,Zangwei Zheng,Ziheng Qin,Zirui Zhu,Yong Liu,Yang You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MERIT, a novel optimizer for large-batch training in deep neural networks, addressing optimization challenges in attention layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-batch training accelerates deep neural network training but creates issues in optimization and generalization, particularly in language models.

Method: MERIT utilizes a max-norm calculation for trust ratios and introduces element-wise trust ratios to constrain max attention logits and improve update scaling.

Result: Experiments on GPT-2 models show MERIT's superior performance, including stable training with a 6k batch size in GPT-2 Medium, without degradation in 48B training tokens.

Conclusion: MERIT improves training stability for large-batch operations, promotes larger batch usability, and contributes to faster development of large language models.

Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of
deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and
generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation
during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck
in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While
the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still
face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are
less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.
Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks
relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm
to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more
effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to
provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.
Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2
models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the
training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance
degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.
This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and
finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves
the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling
faster development and iteration of large language models. Code is available at

### [223] [Local Virtual Nodes for Alleviating Over-Squashing in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20597)
*Tuğrul Hasan Karabulut,İnci M. Baytaş*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Local Virtual Nodes (LVNs) to tackle over-squashing in graph neural networks (GNNs) without altering the graph's global structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address over-squashing in GNNs caused by bottlenecks when passing messages through long-range dependencies, without corrupting domain-specific graph structures.

Method: Introduce LVNs with trainable embeddings based on node centrality to improve connectivity in high-bottleneck areas, aiding information exchange without extensive graph modifications.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate LVNs improve structural connectivity and achieve better graph and node classification performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: LVNs provide an effective solution to over-squashing in GNNs, enhancing performance while preserving the original graph topology for domain-specific tasks.

Abstract: Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks
involving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field
should be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,
gathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its
content into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable
to bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied
remedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate
over-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global
topology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph
structure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This
study presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate
the effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global
structure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the
node centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,
the proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with
likely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across
selected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without
adding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve
performance on graph and node classification tasks. The code can be found at

TL;DR: This paper explores adapting Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) with Vision Transformer (ViT) for self-supervised learning on one-dimensional ultrasound signals, showing significant performance improvements on downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to address the scarcity of labeled data and task-specific signal processing challenges in analyzing ultrasound signals, which are crucial in applications like non-destructive testing and structural health monitoring.

Method: The authors leveraged MAEs for self-supervised pre-training on synthetic ultrasound signals, systematically analyzing model size, patch size, and masking ratio for efficiency and accuracy in downstream tasks like ToF classification.

Result: Pre-trained models outperformed models trained from scratch and CNN baselines on the downstream task, and pre-training on synthetic data improved transferability to real-world signals.

Conclusion: MAEs show strong potential for advancing ultrasound signal analysis through scalable, self-supervised learning methodologies.

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)
with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation
learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have
demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their
use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely
unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as
non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where
labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We
propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic
ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that
enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)
classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model
size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream
accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform
models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)
baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on
synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured
signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study
underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis
through scalable, self-supervised learning.

Motivation: Despite the advancements of LLMs in multimodal reasoning, these models struggle with processing and reasoning over large-scale graph-structured data, motivating the need for a specialized system.

Method: The GDS agent is introduced as a system integrating graph algorithms as tools with a model context protocol (MCP) server, providing preprocessing, algorithm execution, and postprocessing functionalities, compatible with modern LLMs.

Result: The GDS agent can address a broad range of graph algorithm-based questions effectively, as shown through evaluation benchmarks and detailed case studies of both successful scenarios and areas of difficulty.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the GDS agent holds promise in enabling LLMs for graph reasoning tasks, though remaining challenges and areas for improvement in the system are acknowledged.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information
processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function
calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based
systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them.
However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale
graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this
technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph
algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing
of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can
be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any
question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning
about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also
introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as
final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide
spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more
open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we
discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VarDiU, a new method for one-step diffusion model distillation that improves over traditional approaches by using an unbiased gradient estimator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the bias in gradient estimates caused by the imperfect training in existing one-step diffusion model distillation methods, which leads to sub-optimal generation quality.

Method: The proposed method, VarDiU, introduces a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that allows unbiased gradient estimation, ensuring better learning during diffusion distillation.

Result: VarDiU achieves higher quality in generated samples compared to alternative methods like Diff-Instruct, while also enhancing training efficiency and stability.

Conclusion: VarDiU addresses the bias in gradient estimation in diffusion distillation, resulting in improved sample quality and more efficient training for one-step diffusion models.

Abstract: Recently, diffusion distillation methods have compressed thousand-step
teacher diffusion models into one-step student generators while preserving
sample quality. Most existing approaches train the student model using a
diffusive divergence whose gradient is approximated via the student's score
function, learned through denoising score matching (DSM). Since DSM training is
imperfect, the resulting gradient estimate is inevitably biased, leading to
sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose VarDiU (pronounced
/va:rdju:/), a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that admits an unbiased
gradient estimator and can be directly applied to diffusion distillation. Using
this objective, we compare our method with Diff-Instruct and demonstrate that
it achieves higher generation quality and enables a more efficient and stable
training procedure for one-step diffusion distillation.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework for improving neural operators using self-composition, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks and challenging problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency and accuracy of neural operators inspired by iterative numerical PDE methods.

Method: Introduce a neural operator design that deepens the model via self-composition and a train-and-unroll approach for adaptive depth training.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance in benchmarks and superior results in high-frequency USCT problems using a multigrid-inspired backbone.

Conclusion: The framework offers scalable, accurate, and computationally efficient solutions for scientific machine learning tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of neural operators through self-composition, offering both
theoretical guarantees and practical benefits. Inspired by iterative methods in
solving numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), we design a specific
neural operator by repeatedly applying a single neural operator block, we
progressively deepen the model without explicitly adding new blocks, improving
the model's capacity. To train these models efficiently, we introduce an
adaptive train-and-unroll approach, where the depth of the neural operator is
gradually increased during training. This approach reveals an accuracy scaling
law with model depth and offers significant computational savings through our
adaptive training strategy. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate its efficacy on a
challenging high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) problem, where
a multigrid-inspired backbone enables superior performance in resolving complex
wave phenomena. The proposed framework provides a computationally tractable,
accurate, and scalable solution for large-scale data-driven scientific machine
learning applications.

*Michael Hagmann,Michael Staniek,Stefan Riezler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores the generation and understanding of clinical time series through latent states to enable synthetic data generation, showing its effectiveness in forecasting and improving clinical predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand clinical time series through meaningful latent physiological states, enabling improved synthetic data generation for sparse and resource-limited scenarios.

Method: Conceptualizing compositionality in time series generation and employing data-driven procedures to reconstruct elementary states and composition rules, validated via domain adaptation tests.

Result: Synthetic data training achieved comparable or superior forecasting performance to original data, outperforming randomization approaches, specifically benefiting SOFA score prediction.

Conclusion: Synthetic compositionally generated data not only matches the forecasting performance of original clinical data but also improves specific prediction tasks, demonstrating its utility in clinical settings.

Abstract: This work investigates whether time series of natural phenomena can be
understood as being generated by sequences of latent states which are ordered
in systematic and regular ways. We focus on clinical time series and ask
whether clinical measurements can be interpreted as being generated by
meaningful physiological states whose succession follows systematic principles.
Uncovering the underlying compositional structure will allow us to create
synthetic data to alleviate the notorious problem of sparse and low-resource
data settings in clinical time series forecasting, and deepen our understanding
of clinical data. We start by conceptualizing compositionality for time series
as a property of the data generation process, and then study data-driven
procedures that can reconstruct the elementary states and composition rules of
this process. We evaluate the success of this methods using two empirical tests
originating from a domain adaptation perspective. Both tests infer the
similarity of the original time series distribution and the synthetic time
series distribution from the similarity of expected risk of time series
forecasting models trained and tested on original and synthesized data in
specific ways. Our experimental results show that the test set performance
achieved by training on compositionally synthesized data is comparable to
training on original clinical time series data, and that evaluation of models
on compositionally synthesized test data shows similar results to evaluating on
original test data, outperforming randomization-based data augmentation. An
additional downstream evaluation of the prediction task of sequential organ
failure assessment (SOFA) scores shows significant performance gains when model
training is entirely based on compositionally synthesized data compared to
training on original data.

*Weitao Feng,Lixu Wang,Tianyi Wei,Jie Zhang,Chongyang Gao,Sinong Zhan,Peizhuo Lv,Wei Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that adversaries can use reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune language models more effectively for harmful purposes than supervised fine-tuning (SFT). It proposes TokenBuncher, a new defense mechanism to nullify these threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the growing misuse of large language models (LLMs) for harmful tasks, particularly through advanced fine-tuning techniques like reinforcement learning, which are underexplored compared to SFT.

Method: The authors introduce TokenBuncher, a defensive strategy that reduces model response uncertainty through entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism. This limits an RL-based adversarial fine-tuning process from achieving distinct harmful behaviors.

Result: Experiments across various models and RL algorithms demonstrate that TokenBuncher effectively mitigates RL-based harmful fine-tuning without significantly impacting the models' ability to perform benign tasks.

Conclusion: RL-based methods represent a more significant threat than traditional SFT in the context of harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher provides a practical and robust defense mechanism against these threats.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the
risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume
that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we
systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries
to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task
assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging
threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically
targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation
on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,
RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the
model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through
entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the
escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates
harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.
Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater
systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general
defense.

### [231] [EEGDM: Learning EEG Representation with Latent Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20705)
*Shaocong Wang,Tong Liu,Ming Li,Minjing Yu,Yong-Jin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EEGDM leverages a latent diffusion model to improve EEG representation learning, overcoming challenges of generalizability and task diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in EEG signal analysis where current methods fail at generalizable representation learning, especially with limited data.

Method: Introduce EEGDM, a self-supervised learning method incorporating an EEG encoder that uses channel augmentations as conditional information for a latent diffusion model.

Result: EEGDM demonstrates robust representation learning, high-quality EEG signal reconstruction, and superior performance across tasks, with minimal pre-training data requirements.

Conclusion: EEGDM offers a novel, effective approach to EEG representation, proving generalizable utility for diverse applications using limited data.

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has
shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks,
particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning
methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked
reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic
information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we
propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based
on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a
self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong
representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates
an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a
compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the
diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a
compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative
process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results
show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively
learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with
modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its
generalizability and practical utility.

*Christoforos N. Spartalis,Theodoros Semertzidis,Petros Daras,Efstratios Gavves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents SAFEMax, an efficient machine unlearning method for diffusion models that ensures models generate noise for restricted classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for efficient methods to enable machine unlearning in diffusion models, allowing the forgetting of specific data or impermissible classes while retaining necessary knowledge.

Method: SAFEMax maximizes entropy in generated images, leading the model to produce Gaussian noise for impermissible classes. It focuses on early diffusion steps to control forgetting and retention, where class-specific information is most critical.

Result: SAFEMax is shown to be effective in unlearning tasks and significantly more efficient than existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The developed SAFEMax method addresses the challenge of selective forgetting in diffusion models, attaining a balance between effective unlearning and computational efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce SAFEMax, a novel method for Machine Unlearning in diffusion
models. Grounded in information-theoretic principles, SAFEMax maximizes the
entropy in generated images, causing the model to generate Gaussian noise when
conditioned on impermissible classes by ultimately halting its denoising
process. Also, our method controls the balance between forgetting and retention
by selectively focusing on the early diffusion steps, where class-specific
information is prominent. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of SAFEMax
and highlight its substantial efficiency gains over state-of-the-art methods.

### [233] [cMALC-D: Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with Diversity-Based Context Blending](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20818)
*Anirudh Satheesh,Keenan Powell,Hua Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework, cMALC-D, for training multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in variable environments using large language models (LLMs) and a diversity-based blending mechanism to enhance curriculum learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MARL algorithms trained in fixed simulations often fail in real-world scenarios due to complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL) aims to address this by enabling policies to generalize across diverse environments.

Method: The authors propose cMALC-D, a framework combining LLM-guided curriculum generation with diversity-based context blending to create robust training scenarios and improve generalization in MARL.

Result: Experiments in traffic signal control domains show that cMALC-D improves generalization and sample efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Using LLMs for curriculum generation and diversity-based blending enhances exploration and robustness in MARL training, leading to better real-world applicability.

Abstract: Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in
fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world
scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL)
addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and
training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment
configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to
help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on
unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage
estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to
inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we
propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with
Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and
provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage
exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism
that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts.
Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D
significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to
existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at

*Yang Gao,Dongjie Wang,Scott Piersall,Ye Zhang,Liqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework leveraging a revised GPT model for automated feature transformation processes, focusing on scalability, efficiency, and performance improvement in machine learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing feature transformation methods that rely on high computational costs and large parameter sizes in encoder-decoder structures.

Method: Propose a framework using a revised GPT model for embedding space construction, gradient-ascent search, and autoregressive reconstruction to optimize feature transformation.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate comparable or superior model performance to baselines, with remarkable improvements in computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Transformer-based architectures, such as the proposed framework using GPT, provide a scalable and efficient solution for automated feature transformation tasks.

Abstract: Feature transformation plays a critical role in enhancing machine learning
model performance by optimizing data representations. Recent state-of-the-art
approaches address this task as a continuous embedding optimization problem,
converting discrete search into a learnable process. Although effective, these
methods often rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high
computational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that
accomplishes automated feature transformation through four steps:
transformation records collection, embedding space construction with a revised
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, gradient-ascent search, and
autoregressive reconstruction. In our approach, the revised GPT model serves
two primary functions: (a) feature transformation sequence reconstruction and
(b) model performance estimation and enhancement for downstream tasks by
constructing the embedding space. Such a multi-objective optimization framework
reduces parameter size and accelerates transformation processes. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework matches or
exceeds baseline performance, with significant gains in computational
efficiency. This work highlights the potential of transformer-based
architectures for scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation.

*Zeyue Zhang,Lin Song,Erkang Bao,Xiaoling Lv,Xinyue Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ATM-GAD is a graph neural network designed for financial fraud detection by analyzing temporal motifs and adaptive time-window intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional models fail at detecting fraud in complex financial systems due to overlooked indicators like temporal motifs and account-specific activity bursts.

Method: Introduces ATM-GAD, combining a Temporal Motif Extractor and dual-attention blocks (IntraA and InterA), alongside an Adaptive Time-Window Learner for focusing on critical time intervals.

Result: ATM-GAD surpasses seven existing anomaly-detection models on real-world datasets in uncovering fraud patterns.

Conclusion: The model significantly enhances financial fraud detection through innovative use of temporal motifs and adaptive time-window learning.

Abstract: Financial fraud detection is essential to safeguard billions of dollars, yet
the intertwined entities and fast-changing transaction behaviors in modern
financial systems routinely defeat conventional machine learning models. Recent
graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks,
but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal
motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as
they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when
fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both
signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages
temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor
condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs,
preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed
by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single
motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step
fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner
tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus
precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world
datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong
anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier
methods.

*Yijia Guo,Junqing Zhang,Y. -W. Peter Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning-based scheme for physical layer authentication using CSI in mobile IoT scenarios, showcasing improved performance through simulations and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wireless IoT devices face vulnerability in authentication due to the broadcast nature of transmissions. Existing physical layer authentication solutions lack adaptability to dynamic channel variations.

Method: The researchers utilized a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based Siamese network to analyze CSI correlations, using synthetic datasets from WLAN TGn channel models, and evaluated the approach through simulation and practical experiments.

Result: The proposed technique showed superior generalization and authentication performance, improving AUC by 0.03 over an FCN-based Siamese model and by 0.06 over a correlation-based benchmark.

Conclusion: The study validates the deep learning-based CSI authentication method as an effective solution to enhance IoT security in dynamic wireless environments.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous thanks to the rapid development of
wireless technologies. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions
results in great vulnerability to device authentication. Physical layer
authentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel
characteristics. However, a practical scheme applicable to dynamic channel
variations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based
physical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile
scenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation
using IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated
based on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance
correlation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of
manually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial
correlation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their
similarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and
experimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT
development kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both
simulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization
performance of our proposed deep learning-based approach and excellent
authentication performance. Demonstrated by our practical measurement results,
our proposed scheme improved the area under the curve (AUC) by 0.03 compared to
the fully connected network-based (FCN-based) Siamese model and by 0.06
compared to the correlation-based benchmark algorithm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LeMat-Traj, a standardized dataset for machine learning interatomic potentials, aggregating over 120 million quantum mechanical atomic configurations. This aims to overcome inefficiencies in dataset formats and metadata for Density Functional Theory (DFT) derived data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fragmented and inconsistent availability of high-quality quantum mechanical trajectory datasets has constrained the development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Generating such datasets is costly, and difficulties in combining them hinder further advancement.

Method: The research aggregated atomic configurations from large repositories such as the Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD, ensuring standardized data representation and quality filtering. The presented dataset, LeMat-Traj, harmonizes results across diverse DFT functionals. Additionally, the LeMaterial-Fetcher library was developed to streamline the integration of new data sources.

Result: The dataset, encompassing varied energy and force states, significantly enhances MLIP training capabilities. Models fine-tuned using LeMat-Traj displayed a marked improvement in force prediction accuracy for relaxation tasks.

Conclusion: LeMat-Traj addresses critical issues in the MLIP field by providing a high-quality, standardized dataset, while the accompanying LeMaterial-Fetcher tool ensures reproducibility and ongoing dataset evolution. Both tools are publicly accessible to foster collective progress in materials science.

Abstract: The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs)
is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of
quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory
(DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to
variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we
introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic
configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the
Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data
representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations
across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It
significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs.
LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force
structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By
fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a
significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also
present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library
developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the
community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued
evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher

*Dmitry Eremeev,Gleb Bazhenov,Oleg Platonov,Artem Babenko,Liudmila Prokhorenkova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces G2T-FM, a graph foundation model leveraging TabPFNv2 to handle diverse node features in graph datasets, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of handling diverse node features in graph foundation models, a problem not fully explored but also present in tabular data machine learning.

Method: The method involves using TabPFNv2 as the backbone, augmenting node features with neighborhood aggregation, incorporating structural embeddings, and applying it to graph datasets.

Result: G2T-FM achieves notable results, surpassing current graph foundation models and performing on par or better than well-tuned GNNs, both in the in-context regime and after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The study identifies a novel direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for graph machine learning, demonstrating the effectiveness of the G2T-FM approach.

Abstract: While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language
processing and computer vision, their application and potential within graph
machine learning remain largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in
designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that
can vary across different graph datasets. Although many works on GFMs have been
focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling
arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed.
However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in
the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the
recent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a
simple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone.
Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood
feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to
the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our
model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available
GFMs and performing on par with well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover,
after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines, highlighting the
potential of the proposed approach. More broadly, our paper reveals a
previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for
graph machine learning tasks.

*Katherine B. Adams,Justin J. Boutilier,Qinyang He,Yonatan Mintz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for sequential resource allocation with nonstationary rewards, improving personalized interventions through adaptive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address practical settings like community health, digital advertising, and workforce retention where effects evolve dynamically and key objectives are balancing immediate and future outcomes.

Method: Develop combinatorial multi-armed bandit algorithms addressing nonstationary rewards, with theoretical guarantees and practical evaluations.

Result: Demonstrated up to three times improvement in program enrollment in a diabetes intervention case study compared to standard methods.

Conclusion: The framework efficiently addresses dynamic behavioral changes, offering significant real-world impact and bridging adaptive learning with practical applications.

Abstract: We study a sequential resource allocation problem where a decision maker
selects subsets of agents at each period to maximize overall outcomes without
prior knowledge of individual-level effects. Our framework applies to settings
such as community health interventions, targeted digital advertising, and
workforce retention programs, where intervention effects evolve dynamically.
Agents may exhibit habituation (diminished response from frequent selection) or
recovery (enhanced response from infrequent selection). The technical challenge
centers on nonstationary reward distributions that lead to changing
intervention effects over time. The problem requires balancing two key
competing objectives: heterogeneous individual rewards and the
exploration-exploitation tradeoff in terms of learning for improved future
decisions as opposed to maximizing immediate outcomes. Our contribution
introduces the first framework incorporating this form of nonstationary rewards
in the combinatorial multi-armed bandit literature. We develop algorithms with
theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret and demonstrate practical efficacy
through a diabetes intervention case study. Our personalized community
intervention algorithm achieved up to three times as much improvement in
program enrollment compared to baseline approaches, validating the framework's
potential for real-world applications. This work bridges theoretical advances
in adaptive learning with practical challenges in population-level behavioral
change interventions.

TL;DR: InSQuAD improves In-Context Learning performance by utilizing Submodular Mutual Information (SMI) to enhance quality and diversity in exemplar selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance the efficiency of In-Context Learning models by addressing the need for selecting relevant yet diverse in-context examples.

Method: Introduces a unified selection strategy based on Submodular Mutual Information, combining a combinatorial training paradigm with a novel likelihood-based loss and a dataset augmentation approach.

Result: Yields significant performance improvements in In-Context Learning on nine benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the efficacy of enforcing quality and diversity in exemplar selection for improved ICL performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce InSQuAD, designed to enhance the performance of
In-Context Learning (ICL) models through Submodular Mutual Information} (SMI)
enforcing Quality and Diversity among in-context exemplars. InSQuAD achieves
this through two principal strategies: First, we model the ICL task as a
targeted selection problem and introduce a unified selection strategy based on
SMIs which mines relevant yet diverse in-context examples encapsulating the
notions of quality and diversity. Secondly, we address a common pitfall in
existing retrieval models which model query relevance, often overlooking
diversity, critical for ICL. InSQuAD introduces a combinatorial training
paradigm which learns the parameters of an SMI function to enforce both quality
and diversity in the retrieval model through a novel likelihood-based loss. To
further aid the learning process we augment an existing multi-hop question
answering dataset with synthetically generated paraphrases. Adopting the
retrieval model trained using this strategy alongside the novel targeted
selection formulation for ICL on nine benchmark datasets shows significant
improvements validating the efficacy of our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), a method for dynamically improving and controlling alignment in diffusion generative models during inference. It offers better flexibility and performance without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of aligning diffusion-based generative models with complex downstream objectives and overcome the limitations of current reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods.

Method: Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG) is an inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance by combining base and RL fine-tuned model outputs via a geometric average, allowing dynamic control over alignment strength.

Result: Extensive experiments show that RLG consistently improves RL fine-tuned models across various tasks and architectures. It also enables both interpolation and extrapolation for better generative alignment control.

Conclusion: RLG provides a practical, flexible, and theoretically grounded solution for enhancing and dynamically controlling alignment in diffusion generative models, overcoming existing limitations in RL fine-tuning.

Abstract: Denoising-based generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching
algorithms, have achieved remarkable success. However, aligning their output
distributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences,
compositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While
reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL
from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to
these generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion
models and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after
fine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models
through the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward
conditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an
inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining
the outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our
theoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically
equivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL
objectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off
without further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG
consistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various
architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human
preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering.
Furthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby
offering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our
approach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing
and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference. The source code for RLG
is publicly available at the Github:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and infeasibility of retraining models from scratch for removing data traces, especially in large-scale datasets.

Method: LoTUS mitigates overconfidence due to data memorization by smoothing model prediction probabilities within an information-theoretic bound, and introduces the RF-JSD metric for evaluation.

Result: LoTUS was tested on various benchmark datasets, including ImageNet1k, and showed superior performance in efficiency and effectiveness compared to eight baselines.

Conclusion: LoTUS provides a practical and efficient approach for machine unlearning, making it viable for real-world large-scale applications.

Abstract: We present LoTUS, a novel Machine Unlearning (MU) method that eliminates the
influence of training samples from pre-trained models, avoiding retraining from
scratch. LoTUS smooths the prediction probabilities of the model up to an
information-theoretic bound, mitigating its over-confidence stemming from data
memorization. We evaluate LoTUS on Transformer and ResNet18 models against
eight baselines across five public datasets. Beyond established MU benchmarks,
we evaluate unlearning on ImageNet1k, a large-scale dataset, where retraining
is impractical, simulating real-world conditions. Moreover, we introduce the
novel Retrain-Free Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RF-JSD) metric to enable
evaluation under real-world conditions. The experimental results show that
LoTUS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and
effectiveness. Code: https://github.com/cspartalis/LoTUS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of organoids as adaptive bio-hybrid computational elements for tactile data processing and encoding.

Method: Organoids were stimulated using electrical patterns mapped from tactile sensor data to measure responses and analyze Braille classification accuracy in single and multi-organoid setups.

Result: Single organoid Braille classification showed 61% accuracy, which enhanced to 83% using three organoids, with better robustness to artificial noise.

Conclusion: Organoids can serve as scalable components for bio-hybrid computing systems, demonstrating adaptability and computational efficiency.

Abstract: This study proposes a generalizable encoding strategy that maps tactile
sensor data to electrical stimulation patterns, enabling neural organoids to
perform an open-loop artificial tactile Braille classification task. Human
forebrain organoids cultured on a low-density microelectrode array (MEA) are
systematically stimulated to characterize the relationship between electrical
stimulation parameters (number of pulse, phase amplitude, phase duration, and
trigger delay) and organoid responses, measured as spike activity and spatial
displacement of the center of activity. Implemented on event-based tactile
inputs recorded from the Evetac sensor, our system achieved an average Braille
letter classification accuracy of 61 percent with a single organoid, which
increased significantly to 83 percent when responses from a three-organoid
ensemble were combined. Additionally, the multi-organoid configuration
demonstrated enhanced robustness against various types of artificially
introduced noise. This research demonstrates the potential of organoids as
low-power, adaptive bio-hybrid computational elements and provides a
foundational encoding framework for future scalable bio-hybrid computing
architectures.

Motivation: Current OSFS methods struggle with data incompleteness and uncertain feature-label correlations, degrading performance.

Method: POS2FS incorporates PSO-driven supervision for reducing uncertainty and applies three-way decision theory to manage feature fuzziness.

Result: Experimental evaluation on six real-world datasets shows POS2FS outperforms traditional OSFS methods, achieving improved accuracy and feature selection robustness.

Conclusion: POS2FS provides a more reliable approach to online feature selection in high-dimensional streaming data, effectively addressing existing limitations.

Abstract: In real-world applications involving high-dimensional streaming data, online
streaming feature selection (OSFS) is widely adopted. Yet, practical
deployments frequently face data incompleteness due to sensor failures or
technical constraints. While online sparse streaming feature selection (OS2FS)
mitigates this issue via latent factor analysis-based imputation, existing
methods struggle with uncertain feature-label correlations, leading to
inflexible models and degraded performance. To address these gaps, this work
proposes POS2FS-an uncertainty-aware online sparse streaming feature selection
framework enhanced by particle swarm optimization (PSO). The approach
introduces: 1) PSO-driven supervision to reduce uncertainty in feature-label
relationships; 2) Three-way decision theory to manage feature fuzziness in
supervised learning. Rigorous testing on six real-world datasets confirms
POS2FS outperforms conventional OSFS and OS2FS techniques, delivering higher
accuracy through more robust feature subset selection.

*Yi Jiang,Malyaban Bal,Brian Matejek,Susmit Jha,Adam Cobb,Abhronil Sengupta*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel spatio-temporal pruning framework for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to create energy-efficient Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the energy consumption and latency challenges of deploying large LLMs in power-constrained environments by leveraging the energy efficiency of SNNs.

Method: A spatio-temporal pruning framework is designed to reduce active neurons, attention heads, and timesteps in Spiking LLMs. This approach is combined with extreme quantization and knowledge distillation to enhance computational efficiency.

Result: Experimental evaluation of the proposed method using SpikingBERT on the GLUE benchmark showed its effectiveness in reducing computational operations and inference latency while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework makes Spiking LLMs a practical solution for real-time, low-power NLP applications, enabling deployment on edge devices and in energy-constrained setups.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant challenges for deployment in
energy-constrained environments due to their large model sizes and high
inference latency. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the sparse
event-driven neural processing and energy-efficient information transmission in
the brain, offer a promising alternative for achieving low-power computing.
Integrating the event-driven efficiency of spiking neurons with the advanced
capabilities of LLMs represents a promising direction for power-efficient LLMs.
This work specifically delves into the design of compressed spiking LLMs. Here,
we revisit spatial and temporal pruning from the perspective of SNNs and
propose a novel spatio-temporal pruning framework for Spiking LLMs to optimize
computational efficiency while preserving high performance. Our spatial pruning
technique reduces the number of active neurons and attention heads, effectively
lowering the computational complexity of the model. Meanwhile, temporal pruning
minimizes inference latency by dynamically adjusting the number of timesteps
required for different layers. By combining these approaches with other
compression techniques, we present the first work in the domain of Spiking LLMs
to jointly explore spatial pruning, temporal pruning, extreme quantization and
knowledge distillation strategies. Extensive experimental evaluation of our
proposed framework for SpikingBERT on the large-scale GLUE benchmark
demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in terms of computational operations
and inference latency. Our approach offers a compelling solution for real-time,
low-power natural language processing applications, making Spiking LLMs more
practical for deployment on edge devices and in power-constrained settings.

*Naoki Kobayashi,Ryosuke Sato,Ayumi Shinohara,Ryo Yoshinaka*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Solvable Tuple Patterns (STPs) for efficient invariant generation in programs manipulating recursive data structures, utilizing an SMT solver and incorporating this method into CHC solvers, demonstrating its effectiveness in competition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated verification of programs handling recursive data structures remains challenging and requires efficient methods for invariant inference.

Method: Introduces STPs, capable of being inferred using positive samples only, and integrates their inference into CHC solvers backed by SMT solvers.

Result: The proposed CHC solver with STP inference won the ADT-LIN category of CHC-COMP 2025 by a large margin, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The approach significantly advances automated verification of programs with list-like recursive structures, offering a robust and competitive solution.

Abstract: Despite the recent progress of automated program verification techniques,
fully automated verification of programs manipulating recursive data structures
remains a challenge. We introduce the notion of solvable tuple patterns (STPs)
to express invariants between list-like recursive data structures. A
distinguishing feature of STPs is that they can be efficiently inferred from
only a small number of positive samples; no negative samples are required. An
SMT solver that supports the sequence theory can be used to check that an
inferred STP is indeed an inductive invariant. After presenting basic
properties of STPs and an STP inference algorithm, we show how to incorporate
the STP inference into a CHC (Constrained Horn Clauses) solver supporting
list-like data structures, which serves as a uniform backend for automated
program verification tools. A CHC solver incorporating the STP inference has
won the ADT-LIN category of CHC-COMP 2025 by a big margin.

### [248] [Static Factorisation of Probabilistic Programs With User-Labelled Sample Statements and While Loops](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20922)
*Markus Böck,Jürgen Cito*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper explores how probabilistic programs with advanced features can be graphically represented, extending Bayesian networks to a new domain by introducing a sound static analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether probabilistic programs with advanced language features (e.g., user-labeled samples and loops) can be graphically represented, a question not previously resolved.

Method: The authors extend operational semantics to handle advanced features in probabilistic programming. They developed a static analysis technique using a program's control-flow graph to approximate dependencies and transform them into a graphical structure. They also propose a slicing technique for optimization.

Result: Their approach allows for the graphical representation of programs with dynamic structures, enabling novel applications and optimizations. These include reducing gradient variance and improving efficiency in Metropolis Hastings and Monte Carlo methods. Empirical results validate the effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work expands the scope of graphical models to include dynamic probabilistic programs and demonstrates practical optimizations, establishing a new connection between probabilistic programs and Bayesian networks.

Abstract: It is commonly known that any Bayesian network can be implemented as a
probabilistic program, but the reverse direction is not so clear. In this work,
we address the open question to what extent a probabilistic program with
user-labelled sample statements and while loops - features found in languages
like Gen, Turing, and Pyro - can be represented graphically. To this end, we
extend existing operational semantics to support these language features. By
translating a program to its control-flow graph, we define a sound static
analysis that approximates the dependency structure of the random variables in
the program. As a result, we obtain a static factorisation of the implicitly
defined program density, which is equivalent to the known Bayesian network
factorisation for programs without loops and constant labels, but constitutes a
novel graphical representation for programs that define an unbounded number of
random variables via loops or dynamic labels. We further develop a sound
program slicing technique to leverage this structure to statically enable three
well-known optimisations for the considered program class: we reduce the
variance of gradient estimates in variational inference and we speed up both
single-site Metropolis Hastings and sequential Monte Carlo. These optimisations
are proven correct and empirically shown to match or outperform existing
techniques.

*Joonho Lee,Yunho Kim,Seokjoon Kim,Quan Nguyen,Youngjin Heo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a tool-aware collision avoidance system for collaborative robots that works in dynamic environments and adjusts to tool sizes and interactions, showing superior efficiency and accuracy over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to overcome limitations of current robot controllers, which assume static conditions and full visibility, leading to either collisions or overly cautious behavior in dynamic environments.

Method: The proposed method uses a learned perception model to process point clouds, predict collisions under partial visibility, and employs constrained reinforcement learning to train a control policy for real-time smooth maneuvers.

Result: The method outperformed traditional approaches like APF and MPPI in dynamic environments, achieved sub-millimeter accuracy, and reduced computational cost by approximately 60% compared to a GPU-based planner.

Conclusion: The system provides an efficient, modular, and practical collision avoidance solution, demonstrably improving safety and responsiveness for collaborative robots in dynamic settings.

Abstract: Ensuring safe and efficient operation of collaborative robots in human
environments is challenging, especially in dynamic settings where both obstacle
motion and tasks change over time. Current robot controllers typically assume
full visibility and fixed tools, which can lead to collisions or overly
conservative behavior. In our work, we introduce a tool-aware collision
avoidance system that adjusts in real time to different tool sizes and modes of
tool-environment interaction. Using a learned perception model, our system
filters out robot and tool components from the point cloud, reasons about
occluded area, and predicts collision under partial observability. We then use
a control policy trained via constrained reinforcement learning to produce
smooth avoidance maneuvers in under 10 milliseconds. In simulated and
real-world tests, our approach outperforms traditional approaches (APF, MPPI)
in dynamic environments, while maintaining sub-millimeter accuracy. Moreover,
our system operates with approximately 60% lower computational cost compared to
a state-of-the-art GPU-based planner. Our approach provides modular, efficient,
and effective collision avoidance for robots operating in dynamic environments.
We integrate our method into a collaborative robot application and demonstrate
its practical use for safe and responsive operation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPGrasp, a framework for real-time, prompt-driven grasp synthesis for dynamic objects with low-latency inference and strong accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the latency and interactivity trade-off in real-time grasp synthesis for dynamic objects, where existing methods fall short in achieving both low latency and user promptability.

Method: SPGrasp integrates user prompts with spatiotemporal context using an extended Segment Anything Model (SAMv2), allowing for real-time and temporally consistent dynamic object grasping.

Result: SPGrasp achieves high instance-level grasp accuracies (90.6% and 93.8% on OCID and Jacquard datasets, respectively), reduces latency by 58.5% compared to prior methods while maintaining accuracy, and achieves a 94.8% success rate in real-world experiments with dynamic objects.

Conclusion: The proposed SPGrasp framework resolves the challenge of balancing latency and interactivity in dynamic grasp synthesis and paves the way for more effective real-time applications.

Abstract: Real-time interactive grasp synthesis for dynamic objects remains challenging
as existing methods fail to achieve low-latency inference while maintaining
promptability. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGrasp (spatiotemporal
prompt-driven dynamic grasp synthesis), a novel framework extending segment
anything model v2 (SAMv2) for video stream grasp estimation. Our core
innovation integrates user prompts with spatiotemporal context, enabling
real-time interaction with end-to-end latency as low as 59 ms while ensuring
temporal consistency for dynamic objects. In benchmark evaluations, SPGrasp
achieves instance-level grasp accuracies of 90.6% on OCID and 93.8% on
Jacquard. On the challenging GraspNet-1Billion dataset under continuous
tracking, SPGrasp achieves 92.0% accuracy with 73.1 ms per-frame latency,
representing a 58.5% reduction compared to the prior state-of-the-art
promptable method RoG-SAM while maintaining competitive accuracy. Real-world
experiments involving 13 moving objects demonstrate a 94.8% success rate in
interactive grasping scenarios. These results confirm SPGrasp effectively
resolves the latency-interactivity trade-off in dynamic grasp synthesis. Code

*Kipp McAdam Freud,Yijiong Lin,Nathan F. Lepora*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SimShear, a sim-to-real pipeline for tactile control that uses shear information without directly simulating shear dynamics. It leverages a GAN-based method, shPix2pix, to transform simulated shear-absent tactile data into realistic shear-influenced images. The approach is validated through robotic control tasks, showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulating tactile shear information is challenging but important for tasks involving dynamic object interactions. The goal of this work is to address this gap and enable the use of shear information in tactile control tasks through a novel methodology.

Method: The methodology introduces a GAN-based model called shPix2pix that conditions on a simulated tactile image and a shear vector to generate realistic tactile images with shear deformations. This data is tested within a sim-to-real tactile framework on robotic tasks.

Result: The method outperforms baseline models in tasks such as simulating tactile images and in predicting pose/shear. When applied to real-world robotic control tasks like tactile tracking and co-lifting, the method showcases contact errors within 1-2 mm across complex trajectories.

Conclusion: SimShear demonstrates the feasibility of simulating shear data in rigid-body simulators, advancing sim-to-real tactile robotics. The method supports improved tactile data generation and control tasks, indicating potential future applications in dynamic interaction scenarios.

Abstract: We present SimShear, a sim-to-real pipeline for tactile control that enables
the use of shear information without explicitly modeling shear dynamics in
simulation. Shear, arising from lateral movements across contact surfaces, is
critical for tasks involving dynamic object interactions but remains
challenging to simulate. To address this, we introduce shPix2pix, a
shear-conditioned U-Net GAN that transforms simulated tactile images absent of
shear, together with a vector encoding shear information, into realistic
equivalents with shear deformations. This method outperforms baseline pix2pix
approaches in simulating tactile images and in pose/shear prediction. We apply
SimShear to two control tasks using a pair of low-cost desktop robotic arms
equipped with a vision-based tactile sensor: (i) a tactile tracking task, where
a follower arm tracks a surface moved by a leader arm, and (ii) a collaborative
co-lifting task, where both arms jointly hold an object while the leader
follows a prescribed trajectory. Our method maintains contact errors within 1
to 2 mm across varied trajectories where shear sensing is essential, validating
the feasibility of sim-to-real shear modeling with rigid-body simulators and
opening new directions for simulation in tactile robotics.

### [252] [Traversing the Narrow Path: A Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning Framework for Humanoid Beam Walking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20661)
*TianChen Huang,Wei Gao,Runchen Xu,Shiwu Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a two-stage framework for humanoid robots to traverse narrow beams by improving footstep placement using a hybrid approach combining a template and residual planner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the challenges humanoid robots face in traversing narrow beams, which involve sparse, safety-critical contacts and the limitations of learned policies.

Method: A two-stage framework is proposed: Stage-1 trains a low-level tracker on flat surfaces for robust target tracking, while Stage-2 trains a high-level residual planner to refine foot placements on a beam using minimal sensing.

Result: The proposed system can reliably traverse a 0.2 m-wide, 3 m-long beam on a Unitree G1 robot and consistently outperforms baseline approaches in simulation and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The structured framework not only enhances reliability and safety margin but also facilitates easier sim-to-real transfer and analysis, outperforming other methods.

Abstract: Traversing narrow beams is challenging for humanoids due to sparse,
safety-critical contacts and the fragility of purely learned policies. We
propose a physically grounded, two-stage framework that couples an XCoM/LIPM
footstep template with a lightweight residual planner and a simple low-level
tracker. Stage-1 is trained on flat ground: the tracker learns to robustly
follow footstep targets by adding small random perturbations to heuristic
footsteps, without any hand-crafted centerline locking, so it acquires stable
contact scheduling and strong target-tracking robustness. Stage-2 is trained in
simulation on a beam: a high-level planner predicts a body-frame residual
(Delta x, Delta y, Delta psi) for the swing foot only, refining the template
step to prioritize safe, precise placement under narrow support while
preserving interpretability. To ease deployment, sensing is kept minimal and
consistent between simulation and hardware: the planner consumes compact,
forward-facing elevation cues together with onboard IMU and joint signals. On a
Unitree G1, our system reliably traverses a 0.2 m-wide, 3 m-long beam. Across
simulation and real-world studies, residual refinement consistently outperforms
template-only and monolithic baselines in success rate, centerline adherence,
and safety margins, while the structured footstep interface enables transparent
analysis and low-friction sim-to-real transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational, bandwidth, and latency constraints in real-time human-device interaction within industrial Metaverse scenarios.

Method: Proposed an edge-assisted cross-system framework that uses digital twins and incorporates the Human-In-The-Loop Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (HITL-MAML) algorithm for motion prediction, proactive rendering, and preemptive remote control.

Result: In two evaluation tasks: achieved a reduction in RMSE from 0.0712 m to 0.0101 m for trajectory-based drawing and high metrics (PSNR 22.11, SSIM 0.8729, LPIPS 0.1298) in 3D scene representation.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates enhanced interaction precision and visual quality adaptation, making it suitable for high-risk industrial Metaverse settings.

Abstract: Real-time human-device interaction in industrial Metaverse faces challenges
such as high computational load, limited bandwidth, and strict latency. This
paper proposes a task-oriented edge-assisted cross-system framework using
digital twins (DTs) to enable responsive interactions. By predicting operator
motions, the system supports: 1) proactive Metaverse rendering for visual
feedback, and 2) preemptive control of remote devices. The DTs are decoupled
into two virtual functions-visual display and robotic control-optimizing both
performance and adaptability. To enhance generalizability, we introduce the
Human-In-The-Loop Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (HITL-MAML) algorithm, which
dynamically adjusts prediction horizons. Evaluation on two tasks demonstrates
the framework's effectiveness: in a Trajectory-Based Drawing Control task, it
reduces weighted RMSE from 0.0712 m to 0.0101 m; in a real-time 3D scene
representation task for nuclear decommissioning, it achieves a PSNR of 22.11,
SSIM of 0.8729, and LPIPS of 0.1298. These results show the framework's
capability to ensure spatial precision and visual fidelity in real-time,
high-risk industrial environments.

*Yuki Tanaka,Seiichiro Katsura*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of declining skilled workers by proposing a method to teach robots tasks using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), focusing on motion imitation and skill transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With a global decrease in skilled labor, there is a need to transfer expert skills to robots effectively, aiming for flexibility in task execution based on human intention.

Method: The authors employ Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to develop a flexible motion translation system where robots learn tasks and skills through input data and trained models.

Result: The approach was successfully evaluated on a 3-DOF calligraphy robot, demonstrating its capacity to reproduce human-like skills in both position and force-based tasks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that using GANs ensures more flexible and intentional skill translation between humans and robots, offering a promising solution for addressing the skilled worker shortage globally.

Abstract: Decreasing skilled workers is a very serious problem in the world. To deal
with this problem, the skill transfer from experts to robots has been
researched. These methods which teach robots by human motion are called
imitation learning. Experts' skills generally appear in not only position data,
but also force data. Thus, position and force data need to be saved and
reproduced. To realize this, a lot of research has been conducted in the
framework of a motion-copying system. Recent research uses machine learning
methods to generate motion commands. However, most of them could not change
tasks by following human intention. Some of them can change tasks by
conditional training, but the labels are limited. Thus, we propose the flexible
motion translation method by using Generative Adversarial Networks. The
proposed method enables users to teach robots tasks by inputting data, and
skills by a trained model. We evaluated the proposed system with a 3-DOF
calligraphy robot.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents the Uncertainty-Aware Predictive Control Barrier Functions (UA-PCBFs), a framework that integrates probabilistic human motion forecasting and formal safety guarantees, allowing robots to balance safety and effective interaction in shared human-robot workspaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current collaborative robot systems, especially the over-conservatism and ineffectiveness caused by worst-case human motion prediction approaches, and improve human-robot interaction fluidity in shared workspaces.

Method: The paper introduces UA-PCBFs, a framework combining probabilistic forecasting of human motion uncertainty with Control Barrier Functions, enabling dynamic safety margin adjustments and more informed motion planning.

Result: The framework was validated through real-world experiments with both automated setups and direct human-robot interactions, demonstrating improved performance in maintaining safety and usability compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: UA-PCBFs enhance safety, task-critical performance, and human confidence during interactions, enabling more responsive and effective human-robot collaboration.

Abstract: To enable flexible, high-throughput automation in settings where people and
robots share workspaces, collaborative robotic cells must reconcile stringent
safety guarantees with the need for responsive and effective behavior. A
dynamic obstacle is the stochastic, task-dependent variability of human motion:
when robots fall back on purely reactive or worst-case envelopes, they brake
unnecessarily, stall task progress, and tamper with the fluidity that true
Human-Robot Interaction demands. In recent years, learning-based human-motion
prediction has rapidly advanced, although most approaches produce worst-case
scenario forecasts that often do not treat prediction uncertainty in a
well-structured way, resulting in over-conservative planning algorithms,
limiting their flexibility. We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Predictive Control
Barrier Functions (UA-PCBFs), a unified framework that fuses probabilistic
human hand motion forecasting with the formal safety guarantees of Control
Barrier Functions. In contrast to other variants, our framework allows for
dynamic adjustment of the safety margin thanks to the human motion uncertainty
estimation provided by a forecasting module. Thanks to uncertainty estimation,
UA-PCBFs empower collaborative robots with a deeper understanding of future
human states, facilitating more fluid and intelligent interactions through
informed motion planning. We validate UA-PCBFs through comprehensive real-world
experiments with an increasing level of realism, including automated setups (to
perform exactly repeatable motions) with a robotic hand and direct human-robot
interactions (to validate promptness, usability, and human confidence).
Relative to state-of-the-art HRI architectures, UA-PCBFs show better
performance in task-critical metrics, significantly reducing the number of
violations of the robot's safe space during interaction with respect to the
state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: The integrated thermal-haptic feedback system proves effective in enhancing precision and success in virtual and teleoperation tasks, advancing human-machine interfaces.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel fabric-based thermal-haptic interface for virtual

up to 8.93~N at 50~kPa, while optimization of fingerpad-actuator clearance
enhances cooling efficiency with minimal force reduction. Experimental
validation conducted with two different user studies shows high temperature
identification accuracy (0.98 overall) across three thermal levels, and
significant manipulation improvements in a virtual pick-and-place tasks.
Results show enhanced success rates (88.5\% to 96.4\%, p = 0.029) and improved
force control precision (p = 0.013) when haptic feedback is enabled, validating
the effectiveness of the integrated thermal-haptic approach for advanced

Result: Confirmed ESC's potential in flapping robots for controlled hovering and source seeking within 1D setups.

Conclusion: ESC is a promising natural control method for biomimicry applications in flapping flight and robotics, showing significant experimental promise.

Abstract: In a recent effort, we successfully proposed a categorically novel approach

hummingbirds using a new extremum seeking control (ESC) approach. Said ESC
approach was shown capable of characterizing the physics of hovering and source
seeking by flapping systems, providing at the same time uniquely novel
opportunity for a model-free, real-time biomimicry control design. In this
paper, we experimentally test and verify, for the first time in the literature,
the potential of ESC in flapping robots to achieve model-free, real-time
controlled hovering and source seeking. The results of this paper, while being
restricted to 1D, confirm the premise of introducing ESC as a natural control

Conclusion: PEWM enhances the scalability, interpretability, and generalization capability of embodied intelligence, enabling fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning.

Abstract: While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing
attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a
key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality
of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language
and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video
generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the
embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data
far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on
this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive
Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short
horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic
concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning
complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4)
decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model
(VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further
enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization
of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework
leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic
awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction
and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and
general-purpose embodied intelligence.

*Liding Zhang,Kuanqi Cai,Zhenshan Bing,Chaoqun Wang,Alois Knoll*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Genetic Informed Trees (GIT*), which enhances path planning by integrating diverse environmental data and using reinforced genetic programming to refine heuristics, outperforming existing planners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing path planning methods often oversimplify heuristic functions and fail to fully utilize available environmental data, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: The authors developed GIT*, which integrates detailed environmental inputs like obstacle forces and vertex importance, and employs Reinforced Genetic Programming (RGP) to mutate heuristic functions for optimization.

Result: GIT* outperformed current single-query, sampling-based planners in environments ranging from R^4 to R^16, demonstrating superior computational efficiency and solution quality.

Conclusion: GIT* represents a significant advancement in path planning, leveraging robust environmental data and innovative genetic programming to deliver better guidance and results.

Abstract: Optimal path planning involves finding a feasible state sequence between a
start and a goal that optimizes an objective. This process relies on heuristic
functions to guide the search direction. While a robust function can improve
search efficiency and solution quality, current methods often overlook
available environmental data and simplify the function structure due to the
complexity of information relationships. This study introduces Genetic Informed
Trees (GIT*), which improves upon Effort Informed Trees (EIT*) by integrating a
wider array of environmental data, such as repulsive forces from obstacles and
the dynamic importance of vertices, to refine heuristic functions for better
guidance. Furthermore, we integrated reinforced genetic programming (RGP),
which combines genetic programming with reward system feedback to mutate
genotype-generative heuristic functions for GIT*. RGP leverages a multitude of
data types, thereby improving computational efficiency and solution quality
within a set timeframe. Comparative analyses demonstrate that GIT* surpasses
existing single-query, sampling-based planners in problems ranging from R^4 to
R^16 and was tested on a real-world mobile manipulation task. A video

Motivation: The paper aims to improve sampling-based motion planning by addressing the lack of adaptability to different obstacle distributions in environments.

Method: It uses a deep fuzzy learning approach to dynamically adjust batch size and nearest neighbor parameters based on obstacle density.

Result: LIT* demonstrates faster convergence and higher solution quality compared to other planners, validated in R^8 to R^14 spaces and dual-arm robot manipulation.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances motion planning efficiency and adaptability, showcasing potential for broad applications in robotics.

Abstract: Efficient motion planning algorithms are essential in robotics. Optimizing
essential parameters, such as batch size and nearest neighbor selection in
sampling-based methods, can enhance performance in the planning process.
However, existing approaches often lack environmental adaptability. Inspired by
the method of the deep fuzzy neural networks, this work introduces
Learning-based Informed Trees (LIT*), a sampling-based deep fuzzy
learning-based planner that dynamically adjusts batch size and nearest neighbor
parameters to obstacle distributions in the configuration spaces. By encoding
both global and local ratios via valid and invalid states, LIT* differentiates
between obstacle-sparse and obstacle-dense regions, leading to lower-cost paths
and reduced computation time. Experimental results in high-dimensional spaces
demonstrate that LIT* achieves faster convergence and improved solution
quality. It outperforms state-of-the-art single-query, sampling-based planners
in environments ranging from R^8 to R^14 and is successfully validated on a
dual-arm robot manipulation task. A video showcasing our experimental results

Result: Experimental results show CoCoL significantly reduces communication demands and bandwidth, maintaining high accuracy across diverse, challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: CoCoL demonstrates its suitability for real-world multi-robot collaborative tasks, excelling in efficiency and robustness under complex conditions.

Abstract: Collaborative learning enhances the performance and adaptability of
multi-robot systems in complex tasks but faces significant challenges due to
high communication overhead and data heterogeneity inherent in multi-robot
tasks. To this end, we propose CoCoL, a Communication efficient decentralized
Collaborative Learning method tailored for multi-robot systems with
heterogeneous local datasets. Leveraging a mirror descent framework, CoCoL
achieves remarkable communication efficiency with approximate Newton-type
updates by capturing the similarity between objective functions of robots, and
reduces computational costs through inexact sub-problem solutions. Furthermore,
the integration of a gradient tracking scheme ensures its robustness against
data heterogeneity. Experimental results on three representative multi robot
collaborative learning tasks show the superiority of the proposed CoCoL in
significantly reducing both the number of communication rounds and total
bandwidth consumption while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy. These
benefits are particularly evident in challenging scenarios involving non-IID
(non-independent and identically distributed) data distribution, streaming
data, and time-varying network topologies.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called GODHS that merges semantic perception and spatial reasoning using language models to efficiently guide robots in object search within complex environments. It demonstrates improved search efficiency over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance robots' ability to search and identify objects in complex, unstructured environments by moving beyond static semantics and incorporating contextual reasoning.

Method: The proposed method, GODHS, is a hierarchical navigation framework that uses large language models for scene semantics and a heuristic-based motion planner for exploration. Structured prompts and logical constraints are employed for reliable reasoning.

Result: Evaluations in Isaac Sim revealed that GODHS significantly outperformed conventional, non-semantic search strategies in terms of search efficiency.

Conclusion: GODHS effectively integrates semantic and spatial reasoning to address object search challenges, demonstrating its potential for improving navigation and exploration in unfamiliar environments.

Abstract: Enabling robots to efficiently search for and identify objects in complex,
unstructured environments is critical for diverse applications ranging from
household assistance to industrial automation. However, traditional scene
representations typically capture only static semantics and lack interpretable
contextual reasoning, limiting their ability to guide object search in
completely unfamiliar settings. To address this challenge, we propose a
language-enhanced hierarchical navigation framework that tightly integrates
semantic perception and spatial reasoning. Our method, Goal-Oriented
Dynamically Heuristic-Guided Hierarchical Search (GODHS), leverages large
language models (LLMs) to infer scene semantics and guide the search process
through a multi-level decision hierarchy. Reliability in reasoning is achieved
through the use of structured prompts and logical constraints applied at each
stage of the hierarchy. For the specific challenges of mobile manipulation, we
introduce a heuristic-based motion planner that combines polar angle sorting
with distance prioritization to efficiently generate exploration paths.
Comprehensive evaluations in Isaac Sim demonstrate the feasibility of our
framework, showing that GODHS can locate target objects with higher search
efficiency compared to conventional, non-semantic search strategies. Website

*Curtis C. Johnson,Daniel Webb,David Hill,Marc D. Killpack*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a scalable tactile sensing architecture addressing wiring, throughput, and reliability challenges. It uses a novel daisy-chained SPI bus topology for synchronized, real-time data streaming from thousands of tactile sensors, enabling precise manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tactile sensing systems for whole-body manipulation face challenges with wiring complexity, data throughput, and system reliability.

Method: The authors developed an architecture combining fabric-based sensors, custom readout electronics to minimize signal crosstalk, and a daisy-chained SPI bus topology for efficient communication.

Result: The system streams data from over 8,000 sensors covering 1 square meter at over 50 FPS, allowing real-time control. It demonstrated success in a robot grasping task, showing improved performance with tactile feedback.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture overcomes traditional barriers to tactile sensing scalability and enables robust, real-time control for advanced robotic manipulation and human-robot interaction research.

Abstract: Scaling tactile sensing for robust whole-body manipulation is a significant
challenge, often limited by wiring complexity, data throughput, and system
reliability. This paper presents a complete architecture designed to overcome
these barriers. Our approach pairs open-source, fabric-based sensors with
custom readout electronics that reduce signal crosstalk to less than 3.3%
through hardware-based mitigation. Critically, we introduce a novel,
daisy-chained SPI bus topology that avoids the practical limitations of common
wireless protocols and the prohibitive wiring complexity of USB hub-based
systems. This architecture streams synchronized data from over 8,000 taxels
across 1 square meter of sensing area at update rates exceeding 50 FPS,
confirming its suitability for real-time control. We validate the system's
efficacy in a whole-body grasping task where, without feedback, the robot's
open-loop trajectory results in an uncontrolled application of force that
slowly crushes a deformable cardboard box. With real-time tactile feedback, the
robot transforms this motion into a gentle, stable grasp, successfully
manipulating the object without causing structural damage. This work provides a
robust and well-characterized platform to enable future research in advanced
whole-body control and physical human-robot interaction.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ActLoc is an active viewpoint-aware planning framework that enhances robot localization by selecting optimal viewing angles based on predicted accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unreliable robot localization in ambiguous regions or from uninformative viewing directions during navigation.

Method: ActLoc uses an attention-based model that encodes metric maps and camera poses, predicting localization accuracy across yaw and pitch at 3D locations. These predictions are used in a path planner.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results for single viewpoint selection and generalizes well to full trajectory planning.

Conclusion: The framework improves localization accuracy while adhering to task constraints, making it applicable for diverse navigation and inspection tasks.

Abstract: Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation, yet most existing
systems implicitly assume that all viewing directions at a location are equally
informative. In practice, localization becomes unreliable when the robot
observes unmapped, ambiguous, or uninformative regions. To address this, we
present ActLoc, an active viewpoint-aware planning framework for enhancing
localization accuracy for general robot navigation tasks. At its core, ActLoc
employs a largescale trained attention-based model for viewpoint selection. The
model encodes a metric map and the camera poses used during map construction,
and predicts localization accuracy across yaw and pitch directions at arbitrary
3D locations. These per-point accuracy distributions are incorporated into a
path planner, enabling the robot to actively select camera orientations that
maximize localization robustness while respecting task and motion constraints.
ActLoc achieves stateof-the-art results on single-viewpoint selection and
generalizes effectively to fulltrajectory planning. Its modular design makes it
readily applicable to diverse robot navigation and inspection tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces UltraTac, a visuotactile sensor that integrates ultrasound sensing to enhance object material and texture recognition. It achieves high accuracy in multiple tasks including material classification and robotic manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visuotactile sensors lack the capability to identify material features, which limits their application in object recognition and interaction.

Method: UltraTac integrates visuotactile imaging with ultrasound sensing using a coaxial optoacoustic design. Acoustic matching is employed to preserve visuotactile performance while enabling ultrasound sensing.

Result: Systematic experiments show UltraTac performs proximity sensing (3-8 cm range, $R^2=0.90$), material classification (99.20% accuracy), and dual-mode object recognition (92.11% accuracy on 15 classes).

Conclusion: UltraTac successfully bridges the gap between tactile sensing and material recognition, demonstrating advanced functionalities suitable for precise robotic manipulation and human-machine interaction.

Abstract: Visuotactile sensors provide high-resolution tactile information but are
incapable of perceiving the material features of objects. We present UltraTac,
an integrated sensor that combines visuotactile imaging with ultrasound sensing
through a coaxial optoacoustic architecture. The design shares structural
components and achieves consistent sensing regions for both modalities.
Additionally, we incorporate acoustic matching into the traditional
visuotactile sensor structure, enabling integration of the ultrasound sensing
modality without compromising visuotactile performance. Through tactile
feedback, we dynamically adjust the operating state of the ultrasound module to
achieve flexible functional coordination. Systematic experiments demonstrate
three key capabilities: proximity sensing in the 3-8 cm range ($R^2=0.90$),
material classification (average accuracy: 99.20%), and texture-material
dual-mode object recognition achieving 92.11% accuracy on a 15-class task.
Finally, we integrate the sensor into a robotic manipulation system to
concurrently detect container surface patterns and internal content, which
verifies its potential for advanced human-machine interaction and precise
robotic manipulation.

*Mateusz Jaszczuk,Nadia Figueroa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Rapid Mismatch Estimation (RME), a probabilistic framework for estimating dynamics mismatches in robots during physical human-robot interaction without external force-torque sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure safe and effective interactions in human-centric environments, torque-controlled robots need accurate dynamics models, as mismatches can lead to unsafe behavior and task failures.

Method: RME leverages a Neural Network Model Mismatch Estimator to generate a prior for a Variational Inference solver, which estimates unknown dynamics parameters online using the robot's proprioceptive feedback.

Result: The proposed RME adapts to sudden changes in mass and center of mass of a 7-DoF manipulator's end-effector within approximately 400 ms, including in collaborative scenarios with dynamic changes.

Conclusion: RME enables robots to adapt quickly and safely to changing dynamics without relying on external sensory systems, enhancing physical interaction capabilities in dynamic, human-centric tasks.

Abstract: With robots increasingly operating in human-centric environments, ensuring
soft and safe physical interactions, whether with humans, surroundings, or
other machines, is essential. While compliant hardware can facilitate such
interactions, this work focuses on impedance controllers that allow
torque-controlled robots to safely and passively respond to contact while
accurately executing tasks. From inverse dynamics to quadratic
programming-based controllers, the effectiveness of these methods relies on
accurate dynamics models of the robot and the object it manipulates. Any model
mismatch results in task failures and unsafe behaviors. Thus, we introduce
Rapid Mismatch Estimation (RME), an adaptive, controller-agnostic,
probabilistic framework that estimates end-effector dynamics mismatches online,
without relying on external force-torque sensors. From the robot's
proprioceptive feedback, a Neural Network Model Mismatch Estimator generates a
prior for a Variational Inference solver, which rapidly converges to the
unknown parameters while quantifying uncertainty. With a real 7-DoF manipulator
driven by a state-of-the-art passive impedance controller, RME adapts to sudden
changes in mass and center of mass at the end-effector in $\sim400$ ms, in
static and dynamic settings. We demonstrate RME in a collaborative scenario
where a human attaches an unknown basket to the robot's end-effector and
dynamically adds/removes heavy items, showcasing fast and safe adaptation to
changing dynamics during physical interaction without any external sensory
system.

TL;DR: The paper presents a hierarchical framework for humanoid robots to play table tennis effectively, achieving up to 106 consecutive shots with a human opponent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots struggle with tasks demanding rapid interaction in dynamic environments, such as table tennis, which requires agility, precision, and sub-second reaction times.

Method: The framework combines a model-based planner for trajectory prediction and racket planning with a reinforcement learning-based whole-body controller, incorporating human motion references during training.

Result: The humanoid robot achieved up to 106 consecutive shots against a human opponent and sustained exchanges with another humanoid robot, showcasing sub-second reactive control.

Conclusion: The study marks progress towards agile and interactive humanoid behaviors, demonstrating real-world effectiveness in high-speed manipulation tasks like table tennis.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have recently achieved impressive progress in locomotion and
whole-body control, yet they remain constrained in tasks that demand rapid
interaction with dynamic environments through manipulation. Table tennis
exemplifies such a challenge: with ball speeds exceeding 5 m/s, players must
perceive, predict, and act within sub-second reaction times, requiring both
agility and precision. To address this, we present a hierarchical framework for
humanoid table tennis that integrates a model-based planner for ball trajectory
prediction and racket target planning with a reinforcement learning-based
whole-body controller. The planner determines striking position, velocity and
timing, while the controller generates coordinated arm and leg motions that
mimic human strikes and maintain stability and agility across consecutive
rallies. Moreover, to encourage natural movements, human motion references are
incorporated during training. We validate our system on a general-purpose
humanoid robot, achieving up to 106 consecutive shots with a human opponent and
sustained exchanges against another humanoid. These results demonstrate
real-world humanoid table tennis with sub-second reactive control, marking a
step toward agile and interactive humanoid behaviors.

Abstract: Creating assembly products demands significant manual effort and expert
knowledge in 1) designing the assembly and 2) constructing the product. This
paper introduces Prompt-to-Product, an automated pipeline that generates
real-world assembly products from natural language prompts. Specifically, we
leverage LEGO bricks as the assembly platform and automate the process of
creating brick assembly structures. Given the user design requirements,
Prompt-to-Product generates physically buildable brick designs, and then
leverages a bimanual robotic system to construct the real assembly products,

TL;DR: The paper introduces an online adaptive learning framework to improve real-world adaptation of robot control policies trained in simulation by combining residual dynamics learning with differentiable simulation for rapid policy updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivating issue is the challenge of transferring robot control policies trained in simulation to the real world due to the sim-to-real gap, where unmodeled dynamics and disturbances degrade performance.

Method: The method involves an online adaptive learning framework that combines residual dynamics learning and real-time policy adaptation using a continuously refined dynamics model embedded in a differentiable simulation environment.

Result: The proposed approach reduced hovering error by up to 81% compared to L1-MPC and 55% compared to DATT, with enhancements in vision-based control robustness without explicit state estimation.

Conclusion: By rapidly adapting policies in the real world and efficiently addressing unmodeled dynamics, the framework effectively bridges the sim-to-real gap, making it a promising solution for agile robotic operations.

Abstract: Learning control policies in simulation enables rapid, safe, and
cost-effective development of advanced robotic capabilities. However,
transferring these policies to the real world remains difficult due to the
sim-to-real gap, where unmodeled dynamics and environmental disturbances can
degrade policy performance. Existing approaches, such as domain randomization
and Real2Sim2Real pipelines, can improve policy robustness, but either struggle
under out-of-distribution conditions or require costly offline retraining. In
this work, we approach these problems from a different perspective. Instead of
relying on diverse training conditions before deployment, we focus on rapidly
adapting the learned policy in the real world in an online fashion. To achieve
this, we propose a novel online adaptive learning framework that unifies
residual dynamics learning with real-time policy adaptation inside a
differentiable simulation. Starting from a simple dynamics model, our framework
refines the model continuously with real-world data to capture unmodeled
effects and disturbances such as payload changes and wind. The refined dynamics
model is embedded in a differentiable simulation framework, enabling gradient
backpropagation through the dynamics and thus rapid, sample-efficient policy
updates beyond the reach of classical RL methods like PPO. All components of
our system are designed for rapid adaptation, enabling the policy to adjust to
unseen disturbances within 5 seconds of training. We validate the approach on
agile quadrotor control under various disturbances in both simulation and the
real world. Our framework reduces hovering error by up to 81% compared to
L1-MPC and 55% compared to DATT, while also demonstrating robustness in
vision-based control without explicit state estimation.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLM capabilities in generating code for microservice-based applications, finding mixed performance based on difficulty and identifying key challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess how well LLMs, like GPT-3o-mini, can generate functional code for real-world microservice-based applications, and identify their limitations.

Method: Define a difficulty metric for code synthesis, use a standardized template for specifications, and implement a framework with unit tests to evaluate LLM-generated code.

Result: LLMs perform well on medium difficulty tasks but struggle with high-difficulty specifications involving complex business logic, external services, database integration, and non-functional features.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for improvements in LLMs to handle complex, real-world coding tasks and provides insights for future research.

Abstract: In this paper we evaluate how far LLMs have advanced in generating code for
real-world problems. Specifically, we explore code synthesis for
microservice-based applications, a widely used architecture pattern. We define
a standard template for specifying these applications, and we propose a metric
for judging the difficulty level of a specification. The higher the score, the
more difficult it is to generate code for the specification. We develop a
framework to automate the process of testing LLM-synthesized code for a
microservice using unit tests. Our experimental results show that strong LLMs
(like GPT-3o-mini) do fairly well on medium difficulty specifications but do
very poorly on those of higher difficulty levels. This is due to more intricate
business logic, a greater use of external services, database integration and
inclusion of non-functional capabilities such as authentication. We analyzed
the errors in LLM-synthesized code and report on the key challenges LLMs face
in generating code for these specifications thereby suggesting future research
directions to improve code synthesis for real-world problems.

It introduces methods like dynamic exploration and error-insensitive reinforcement learning to achieve balanced correctness and efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the observation that generated code from large language models suffers from poor runtime efficiency, which limits its practical usability in performance-sensitive environments.

Method: An efficiency-oriented reinforcement learning framework is developed, incorporating dynamic exploration, error-insensitive learning, high-contrast efficiency signals, and an optimized two-stage tuning methodology.

Result: The proposed method improves code correctness by 10.18% and runtime efficiency by 7.75% on a 7B model, achieving performance comparable to much larger models.

Conclusion: The paper presents a promising approach to overcoming runtime inefficiency in code generation, showcasing how reinforcement learning techniques can yield significant improvements in both correctness and efficiency for large language models.

Abstract: While code large language models have demonstrated remarkable progress in
code generation, the generated code often exhibits poor runtime efficiency,
limiting its practical application in performance-sensitive scenarios. To
address this limitation, we propose an efficiency-oriented reinforcement
learning framework guided by a novel performance reward. Based on this
framework, we take a deeper dive into the code efficiency problem, identifying
then proposing methods to overcome key bottlenecks: (1) Dynamic exploration
overcomes the static data constraints of offline fine-tuning, enabling the
discovery of more efficient code implementations. (2) The error-insensitive
reinforcement learning method and high-contrast efficiency signals are crucial
for mitigating systematic errors and achieving effective optimization. (3)
Online exploration is most effective when starting from a high-correctness
baseline, as this allows for efficiency improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. With these discoveries, we finally propose a two-stage tuning method,
which achieves high and balanced performance across correctness and efficiency.
The results of experiments show the effectiveness of the method, which improves
code correctness by 10.18\% and runtime efficiency by 7.75\% on a 7B model,
achieving performance comparable to much larger model.

*Maolin Sun,Yibiao Yang,Yuming Zhou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents Chimera, a framework leveraging LLMs for generating valid and semantically diverse test formulas for SMT solvers, significantly reducing runtime costs and identifying several solver bugs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Testing SMT solvers is critical as they form the backbone of symbolic execution and automated verification tasks. Existing techniques struggle to sustain quality testing with evolving solver features.

Method: Chimera uses LLMs to extract context-free grammars for SMT theories and synthesize reusable Boolean term generators. It populates formula skeletons with syntactically valid and semantically diverse terms during fuzzing, ensuring reduced computational costs.

Result: Chimera uncovered 43 bugs in two SMT solvers (Z3 and cvc5), with developers fixing 40 of them, demonstrating the framework’s effectiveness.

Conclusion: Chimera enhances SMT solver testing by ensuring syntactic validity, promoting semantic diversity, and reducing runtime overhead through efficient use of LLMs.

Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers are foundational to modern systems
and programming languages research, providing the foundation for tasks like
symbolic execution and automated verification. Because these solvers sit on the
critical path, their correctness is essential, and high-quality test formulas
are key to uncovering bugs. However, while prior testing techniques performed
well on earlier solver versions, they struggle to keep pace with rapidly
evolving features. Recent approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) show
promise in exploring advanced solver capabilities, but two obstacles remain:
nearly half of the generated formulas are syntactically invalid, and iterative
interactions with the LLMs introduce substantial computational overhead. In
this study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that
addresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the
synthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators. Particularly,
Chimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for
SMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2)
synthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars.
During fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing
formulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators.
This design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity.
Notably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment,
dramatically reducing runtime cost. We evaluated Chimera on two leading SMT
solvers: Z3 and cvc5. Our experiments show that Chimera has identified 43
confirmed bugs, 40 of which have already been fixed by developers.

### [275] [Adaptive Root Cause Localization for Microservice Systems with Multi-Agent Recursion-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20370)
*Lingzhe Zhang,Tong Jia,Kangjin Wang,Weijie Hong,Chiming Duan,Minghua He,Ying Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces RCLAgent, a new adaptive method for root cause localization in microservice systems using a multi-agent recursion-of-thought framework, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while requiring fewer data inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of accurately localizing root causes in complex microservice systems, which face frequent failures. Existing solutions either depend too much on pre-defined schemas or lack interpretability, leaving SREs unsupported.

Method: RCLAgent uses a multi-agent recursion-of-thought framework to guide reasoning processes. It integrates data across multiple agents and tools to accurately pinpoint root causes in a system. The method employs human-inspired characteristics such as recursive, multi-dimensional, and cross-modal reasoning.

Result: Experimental results indicate that RCLAgent outperforms state-of-the-art methods, successfully localizing root causes based on a single request without needing to aggregate multiple ones. This highlights its efficiency and precision.

Conclusion: RCLAgent enhances root cause localization in microservice systems by achieving superior performance with less data input. The approach improves adaptability, interpretability, and accuracy for complex environments.

Abstract: As contemporary microservice systems become increasingly popular and
complex-often comprising hundreds or even thousands of fine-grained,
interdependent subsystems-they are facing more frequent failures. Ensuring
system reliability thus demands accurate root cause localization. While traces
and metrics have proven to be effective data sources for this task, existing
methods either heavily rely on pre-defined schemas, which struggle to adapt to
evolving operational contexts, or lack interpretability in their reasoning
process, thereby leaving Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) confused. In this
paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on how SREs localize the root cause of
failures, drawing insights from multiple professional SREs across different
organizations. Our investigation reveals that human root cause analysis
exhibits three key characteristics: recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion,
and cross-modal reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we introduce RCLAgent,
an adaptive root cause localization method for microservice systems that
leverages a multi-agent recursion-of-thought framework. RCLAgent employs a
novel recursion-of-thought strategy to guide the LLM's reasoning process,
effectively integrating data from multiple agents and tool-assisted analysis to
accurately pinpoint the root cause. Experimental evaluations on various public
datasets demonstrate that RCLAgent achieves superior performance by localizing
the root cause using only a single request-outperforming state-of-the-art
methods that depend on aggregating multiple requests. These results underscore
the effectiveness of RCLAgent in enhancing the efficiency and precision of root
cause localization in complex microservice environments.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges in testing LLM-based applications by proposing a three-layer architecture and introducing a quality assurance framework alongside the AICL protocol for standardized testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address quality assurance challenges in Large Language Model (LLM) applications, which have grown more dynamic, complex, and context-dependent.

Method: The authors decompose LLM applications into a three-layer architecture, analyze traditional software testing methods and AI safety analyses, outline structural disconnects, and propose collaborative strategies and a protocol (AICL).

Result: The study identifies four foundational differences and six core challenges in LLM application testing, proposing a quality assurance framework and the AICL protocol for effective testing practices.

Conclusion: A trustworthy testing framework combining pre-deployment validation and runtime monitoring, with a standardized protocol (AICL), is advocated to enhance quality assurance in LLM deployments.

Abstract: Applications of Large Language Models~(LLMs) have evolved from simple text
generators into complex software systems that integrate retrieval augmentation,
tool invocation, and multi-turn interactions. Their inherent non-determinism,
dynamism, and context dependence pose fundamental challenges for quality
assurance. This paper decomposes LLM applications into a three-layer
architecture: \textbf{\textit{System Shell Layer}}, \textbf{\textit{Prompt
Orchestration Layer}}, and \textbf{\textit{LLM Inference Core}}. We then assess
the applicability of traditional software testing methods in each layer:
directly applicable at the shell layer, requiring semantic reinterpretation at
the orchestration layer, and necessitating paradigm shifts at the inference
core. A comparative analysis of Testing AI methods from the software
engineering community and safety analysis techniques from the AI community
reveals structural disconnects in testing unit abstraction, evaluation metrics,
and lifecycle management. We identify four fundamental differences that
underlie 6 core challenges. To address these, we propose four types of
collaborative strategies (\emph{Retain}, \emph{Translate}, \emph{Integrate},
and \emph{Runtime}) and explore a closed-loop, trustworthy quality assurance
framework that combines pre-deployment validation with runtime monitoring.
Based on these strategies, we offer practical guidance and a protocol proposal
to support the standardization and tooling of LLM application testing. We
propose a protocol \textbf{\textit{Agent Interaction Communication Language}}
(AICL) that is used to communicate between AI agents. AICL has the
test-oriented features and is easily integrated in the current agent framework.

### [278] [From Law to Gherkin: A Human-Centred Quasi-Experiment on the Quality of LLM-Generated Behavioural Specifications from Food-Safety Regulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20744)
*Shabnam Hassani,Mehrdad Sabetzadeh,Daniel Amyot*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude and Llama for automating the generation of developer-friendly specifications from legal texts, yielding promising results in terms of relevance, clarity, and time savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal texts are often written in technology-neutral language, making it difficult for engineers to translate them into actionable requirements and acceptance criteria manually. The study aims to explore if LLMs can automate this labor-intensive, error-prone process.

Method: A human-subject quasi-experimental study was conducted with 10 participants evaluating 60 specifications generated by Llama and Claude from food-safety regulations, using Gherkin (a structured BDD language). Each specification was assessed on five criteria, with a total of 120 evaluations.

Result: 75% of relevance, 90% of clarity, 75% of completeness, 82% of singularity, and 68% of time-saving ratings were the highest. No lowest ratings were recorded. Llama slightly exceeded Claude in most aspects, except in singularity where Claude performed better.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that LLMs can effectively generate high-quality Gherkin specifications from legal texts, reducing manual effort and providing useful structured artifacts for implementation, verification, and test creation.

Abstract: Context: Laws and regulations increasingly affect software design and quality
assurance, but legal texts are written in technology-neutral language. This
creates challenges for engineers who must develop compliance artifacts such as
requirements and acceptance criteria. Manual creation is labor-intensive,
error-prone, and requires domain expertise. Advances in Generative AI (GenAI),
especially Large Language Models (LLMs), offer a way to automate deriving such
artifacts.
  Objective: We present the first systematic human-subject study of LLMs'
ability to derive behavioral specifications from legal texts using a
quasi-experimental design. These specifications translate legal requirements
into a developer-friendly form.
  Methods: Ten participants evaluated specifications generated from food-safety
regulations by Claude and Llama. Using Gherkin, a structured BDD language, 60
specifications were produced. Each participant assessed 12 across five
criteria: Relevance, Clarity, Completeness, Singularity, and Time Savings. Each
specification was reviewed by two participants, yielding 120 assessments.
  Results: For Relevance, 75% of ratings were highest and 20% second-highest.
Clarity reached 90% highest. Completeness: 75% highest, 19% second.
Singularity: 82% highest, 12% second. Time Savings: 68% highest, 24% second. No
lowest ratings occurred. Mann-Whitney U tests showed no significant differences
across participants or models. Llama slightly outperformed Claude in Clarity,
Completeness, and Time Savings, while Claude was stronger in Singularity.
Feedback noted hallucinations and omissions but confirmed the utility of the
specifications.
  Conclusion: LLMs can generate high-quality Gherkin specifications from legal
texts, reducing manual effort and providing structured artifacts useful for
implementation, assurance, and test generation.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a vision for a sustainability perspective in software architecture, utilizing evidence from literature and expert focus groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software architects need structured guidance to incorporate sustainability throughout the design phase.

Method: The authors used snowballing on seminal literature and organized focus groups with experts to shape their sustainability perspective vision.

Result: The findings validated the relevance of components for a sustainability perspective in practical scenarios, addressing sustainability concerns effectively.

Conclusion: A sustainability perspective can bridge architectural frameworks and industry settings to address emerging quality properties like sustainability effectively.

Abstract: Sustainability is increasingly recognized as an emerging quality property in
software-intensive systems, yet architects lack structured guidance to address
it effectively throughout the software design phase. Architectural
perspectives-an architectural knowledge artifact composed of concerns,
activities, tactics, pitfalls, and checklists-offer a promising approach to
tackle such emerging quality properties across architectural views and are also
independent of architecture frameworks and industry contexts. In this paper, we
present a sustainability perspective vision, i.e., a revised notion of
architectural perspective meant to be filled with its own elements to target
sustainability concerns. We formulate our sustainability perspective vision
through evidence from applying snowballing to seminal literature and from
conducting a focus group with experts in the field. Our findings confirm the
relevance of the different perspective elements in practice and highlight
implications for shaping a sustainability perspective that meets industrial
needs.

### [280] [Automated Test Oracles for Flaky Cyber-Physical System Simulators: Approach and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20902)
*Baharin A. Jodat,Khouloud Gaaloul,Mehrdad Sabetzadeh,Shiva Nejati*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses costly and flaky simulation-based testing for cyber-physical systems by introducing assertion-based test oracles. These oracles predict test outcomes without system execution, with notable accuracy and robustness, particularly using Genetic Programming (GP) with Ochiai.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulation-based testing in cyber-physical systems is expensive and unreliable due to time-consuming simulators and inconsistent outcomes. There's a need for automated oracles that reduce costs, are interpretable, and handle flaky simulators.

Method: Proposes assertion-based test oracles defined using logical and arithmetic predicates. Methods for generation include genetic programming with SBFL ranking formulas (Ochiai, Tarantula, Naish) and decision tree/rule-based approaches. Evaluates the methods in aerospace, networking, and autonomous driving systems.

Result: GP with Ochiai significantly outperforms other methods (Tarantula, Naish, DT, and DR) in accuracy and remains robust against simulator flakiness, with a minimal accuracy variation of 4% across systems.

Conclusion: Assertion-based test oracles generated by GP with Ochiai offer high accuracy, are interpretable, reduce reliance on flaky simulators, and effectively lower testing costs for cyber-physical systems.

Abstract: Simulation-based testing of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is costly due to the
time-consuming execution of CPS simulators. In addition, CPS simulators may be
flaky, leading to inconsistent test outcomes and requiring repeated test
re-execution for reliable test verdicts. Automated test oracles that do not
require system execution are therefore crucial for reducing testing costs.
Ideally, such test oracles should be interpretable to facilitate human
understanding of test verdicts, and they must be robust against the potential
flakiness of CPS simulators. In this article, we propose assertion-based test
oracles for CPS as sets of logical and arithmetic predicates defined over the
inputs of the system under test. Given a test input, our assertion-based test
oracle determines, without requiring test execution, whether the test passes,
fails, or if the oracle is inconclusive in predicting a verdict. We describe
two methods for generating assertion-based test oracles: one using genetic
programming~(GP) that employs well-known spectrum-based fault localization
(SBFL) ranking formulas, namely Ochiai, Tarantula, and Naish, as fitness
functions; and the other using decision trees (DT) and decision rules (DR). We
evaluate our assertion-based test oracles through case studies in the domains
of aerospace, networking and autonomous driving. We show that test oracles
generated using GP with Ochiai are significantly more accurate than those
obtained using GP with Tarantula and Naish or using DT or DR. Moreover, this
accuracy advantage remains even when accounting for the flakiness of the system
under test. We further show that the assertion-based test oracles generated by
GP with Ochiai are robust against flakiness with only 4% average variation in
their accuracy results across four different network and autonomous driving
systems with flaky behaviours.

*Zuocheng Feng,Kaiwen Zhang,Miaomiao Wang,Yiming Cheng,Yuandao Cai,Xiaofeng Li,Guanjun Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving the detection and localization of concurrency bugs using a novel method with a dedicated dataset, a new graph representation, and interpretability techniques, achieving better accuracy, precision, and recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concurrency bugs are difficult to detect in multi-threaded or distributed systems and existing deep learning methods have limitations such as lack of datasets, insufficient representation of concurrency semantics, and inability to provide fine-grained debug information.

Method: The authors created a dedicated concurrency bug dataset, introduced a Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG), integrated it with a pre-trained model and a heterogeneous GNN, and utilized the SubgraphX interpretability method to localize bugs in source code.

Result: The proposed method achieved an average improvement of 10% in accuracy and precision, and 26% in recall compared to state-of-the-art methods in diverse evaluation settings.

Conclusion: The novel method effectively enhances concurrency bug detection and localization, addressing important limitations in existing approaches, and provides detailed debugging information for software reliability and security.

Abstract: Concurrency bugs, caused by improper synchronization of shared resources in
multi-threaded or distributed systems, are notoriously hard to detect and thus
compromise software reliability and security. The existing deep learning
methods face three main limitations. First, there is an absence of large and
dedicated datasets of diverse concurrency bugs for them. Second, they lack
sufficient representation of concurrency semantics. Third, binary
classification results fail to provide finer-grained debug information such as
precise bug lines. To address these problems, we propose a novel method for
effective concurrency bug detection as well as localization. We construct a
dedicated concurrency bug dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation.
We then integrate a pre-trained model with a heterogeneous graph neural network
(GNN), by incorporating a new Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG) that
concisely and effectively characterizes concurrency semantics. To further
facilitate debugging, we employ SubgraphX, a GNN-based interpretability method,
which explores the graphs to precisely localize concurrency bugs, mapping them
to specific lines of source code. On average, our method demonstrates an
improvement of 10\% in accuracy and precision and 26\% in recall compared to
state-of-the-art methods across diverse evaluation settings.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConfLogger, a tool integrating static taint analysis and LLM-based log generation to improve diagnosing configuration-related software issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems face challenges from configuration-related failures with insufficient diagnostic support in existing tools.

Method: ConfLogger identifies configuration-sensitive code and generates diagnostic log statements by marrying static analysis and LLM-driven log generation.

Result: ConfLogger achieved 100% error localization in case studies, improved existing log coverage by up to 30%, and demonstrated significant precision, recall, and F1-score improvements.

Conclusion: ConfLogger enhances software diagnosability, accelerates debugging, and sets a higher standard for configuration-aware logging practices.

Abstract: Modern configurable systems offer customization via intricate configuration
spaces, yet such flexibility introduces pervasive configuration-related issues
such as misconfigurations and latent softwarebugs. Existing diagnosability
supports focus on post-failure analysis of software behavior to identify
configuration issues, but none of these approaches look into whether the
software clue sufficient failure information for diagnosis. To fill in the
blank, we propose the idea of configuration logging to enhance existing logging
practices at the source code level. We develop ConfLogger, the first tool that
unifies configuration-aware static taint analysis with LLM-based log generation
to enhance software configuration diagnosability. Specifically, our method 1)
identifies configuration-sensitive code segments by tracing
configuration-related data flow in the whole project, and 2) generates
diagnostic log statements by analyzing configuration code contexts. Evaluation
results on eight popular software systems demonstrate the effectiveness of
ConfLogger to enhance configuration diagnosability. Specifically,
ConfLogger-enhanced logs successfully aid a log-based misconfiguration
diagnosis tool to achieve 100% accuracy on error localization in 30 silent
misconfiguration scenarios, with 80% directly resolvable through explicit
configuration information exposed. In addition, ConfLogger achieves 74%
coverage of existing logging points, outperforming baseline LLM-based loggers
by 12% and 30%. It also gains 8.6% higher in precision, 79.3% higher in recall,
and 26.2% higher in F1 compared to the state-of-the-art baseline in terms of
variable logging while also augmenting diagnostic value. A controlled user
study on 22 cases further validated its utility, speeding up diagnostic time by
1.25x and improving troubleshooting accuracy by 251.4%.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified theory combining Bayesian cognitive models with sexual selection for intelligence display, explaining linguistic phenomena, diversity, and learning mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the major facts of language (speed, expressivity, diversity) and its foundational role in human culture by integrating cognitive processing and evolutionary perspectives.

Method: The theory utilizes Construction Grammars with graph-like feature representations, unification for rapid learning, and Bayesian inference to model language processing and pragmatics.

Result: The theory successfully integrates different aspects of language (syntax, semantics, pragmatics) into a seamless computational model based on Bayesian pattern matching.

Conclusion: Language evolution and processing bridge human cognitive and social capabilities, and this model offers a comprehensive explanation for linguistic complexity and its societal significance.

Abstract: A unified theory of language combines a Bayesian cognitive linguistic model
of language processing, with the proposal that language evolved by sexual
selection for the display of intelligence. The theory accounts for the major
facts of language, including its speed and expressivity, and data on language
diversity, pragmatics, syntax and semantics. The computational element of the
theory is based on Construction Grammars. These give an account of the syntax
and semantics of the worlds languages, using constructions and unification. Two
novel elements are added to construction grammars: an account of language
pragmatics, and an account of fast, precise language learning. Constructions
are represented in the mind as graph like feature structures. People use slow
general inference to understand the first few examples they hear of any
construction. After that it is learned as a feature structure, and is rapidly
applied by unification. All aspects of language (phonology, syntax, semantics,
and pragmatics) are seamlessly computed by fast unification; there is no
boundary between semantics and pragmatics. This accounts for the major puzzles
of pragmatics, and for detailed pragmatic phenomena. Unification is Bayesian
maximum likelihood pattern matching. This gives evolutionary continuity between
language processing in the human brain, and Bayesian cognition in animal
brains. Language is the basis of our mind reading abilities, our cooperation,
self esteem and emotions; the foundations of human culture and society.

TL;DR: The paper investigates motivation and value alignment in AI through entropy maximization, focusing on the essence of living agents' entropy-driven actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of true endogenous motivation in AI systems, which can lead to issues like reward hacking, by exploring entropy maximization in physical and cognitive systems.

Method: The author uses thermodynamic and cognitive perspectives to understand the dynamics of motivation and value alignment in AI systems, comparing them to living agents.

Result: The research highlights differences between simulated agents and living entities, emphasizing the role of entropy in endogenous action generation and its connection to motivation.

Conclusion: True motivation in AI systems requires the integration of thermodynamic principles, as seen in living agents, to avoid pathologies like reward hacking.

Abstract: I consider motivation and value-alignment in AI systems from the perspective
of (constrained) entropy maximization. Though the structures encoding knowledge
in any physical system can be understood as energetic constraints, only living
agents harness entropy in the endogenous generation of actions. I argue that
this exploitation of "mortal" or thermodynamic computation, in which cognitive
and physical dynamics are inseparable, is of the essence of desire, motivation,
and value, while the lack of true endogenous motivation in simulated "agents"
predicts pathologies like reward hacking.

TL;DR: The paper examines stochastic gradient optimization in learning problems with nuisance parameters, showing convergence guarantees under certain conditions, including Neyman orthogonality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by nuisance parameters in stochastic gradient optimization and ensure convergence for learning problems.

Method: Analyzed classical stochastic gradient algorithms and introduced a variant with approximately orthogonalized updates to handle nuisance parameters more effectively.

Result: Provided non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for classical and modified stochastic gradient algorithms under conditions like Neyman orthogonality.

Conclusion: Classical stochastic gradient algorithms can still converge despite nuisance parameters under appropriate conditions, and modified variants enhance robustness by integrating orthogonal updates.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient optimization is the dominant learning paradigm for a
variety of scenarios, from classical supervised learning to modern
self-supervised learning. We consider stochastic gradient algorithms for
learning problems whose objectives rely on unknown nuisance parameters, and
establish non-asymptotic convergence guarantees. Our results show that, while
the presence of a nuisance can alter the optimum and upset the optimization
trajectory, the classical stochastic gradient algorithm may still converge
under appropriate conditions, such as Neyman orthogonality. Moreover, even when
Neyman orthogonality is not satisfied, we show that an algorithm variant with
approximately orthogonalized updates (with an approximately orthogonalized
gradient oracle) may achieve similar convergence rates. Examples from
orthogonal statistical learning/double machine learning and causal inference
are discussed.

TL;DR: The paper introduces self-consistency (SC) to enhance Amortized Bayesian Model Comparison (BMC) under simulation model misspecification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of neural surrogate reliability degrading under simulation model misspecification.

Method: The authors added a self-consistency loss to the simulation-based neural surrogate training process, leveraging unlabeled real data.

Result: SC improves calibration for BMC when analytic likelihoods are available but provides limited benefits when using neural surrogate likelihoods.

Conclusion: SC enhances BMC reliability, particularly with exact analytic likelihoods, providing practical utility despite limited impact on neural surrogate likelihoods.

Abstract: Amortized Bayesian model comparison (BMC) enables fast probabilistic ranking
of models via simulation-based training of neural surrogates. However, the
reliability of neural surrogates deteriorates when simulation models are
misspecified - the very case where model comparison is most needed. Thus, we
supplement simulation-based training with a self-consistency (SC) loss on
unlabeled real data to improve BMC estimates under empirical distribution
shifts. Using a numerical experiment and two case studies with real data, we
compare amortized evidence estimates with and without SC against analytic or
bridge sampling benchmarks. SC improves calibration under model
misspecification when having access to analytic likelihoods. However, it offers
limited gains with neural surrogate likelihoods, making it most practical for
trustworthy BMC when likelihoods are exact.

TL;DR: This paper introduces polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) as a method for operator learning (OL) in scientific machine learning (SciML), focusing on the solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore alternative operator learning methods beyond deep neural networks like DeepONet and Fourier Neural Operator, and to leverage PCE for its promising potential in uncertainty quantification and SciML.

Method: The framework leverages PCE to approximate operators in data-driven and physics-informed settings by solving a system of equations for PCE coefficients. It also facilitates uncertainty quantification through post-processing these coefficients without extra computational cost.

Result: The PCE-based approach demonstrated strong numerical accuracy, computational efficiency, and robust performance in both operator learning and uncertainty quantification across diverse PDE problems.

Conclusion: This study highlights that PCE is an effective and computationally efficient method for operator learning, offering accurate results and integrated uncertainty quantification with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Operator learning (OL) has emerged as a powerful tool in scientific machine
learning (SciML) for approximating mappings between infinite-dimensional
functional spaces. One of its main applications is learning the solution
operator of partial differential equations (PDEs). While much of the progress
in this area has been driven by deep neural network-based approaches such as
Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), recent
work has begun to explore traditional machine learning methods for OL. In this
work, we introduce polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) as an OL method. PCE has
been widely used for uncertainty quantification (UQ) and has recently gained
attention in the context of SciML. For OL, we establish a mathematical
framework that enables PCE to approximate operators in both purely data-driven
and physics-informed settings. The proposed framework reduces the task of
learning the operator to solving a system of equations for the PCE
coefficients. Moreover, the framework provides UQ by simply post-processing the
PCE coefficients, without any additional computational cost. We apply the
proposed method to a diverse set of PDE problems to demonstrate its
capabilities. Numerical results demonstrate the strong performance of the
proposed method in both OL and UQ tasks, achieving excellent numerical accuracy
and computational efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the transfer learning framework to include decision rules by addressing posterior drift, improving the methodology through Bayes decision rules, and geometric boundary transformations.

Method: Reformulates posterior drift modeling as a low-dimensional empirical risk minimization problem, ensuring estimator consistency and deriving theoretical risk bounds under regularity conditions.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance and robustness through extensive simulations and real-world data analyses, showing its broad applicability.

Conclusion: The methodology advances decision rule modeling in transfer learning, proving effective for tasks like estimating optimal individualized treatment rules while maintaining theoretical soundness and practical robustness.

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the transfer learning classification framework from
regression function-based methods to decision rules. We propose a novel
methodology for modeling posterior drift through Bayes decision rules. By
exploiting the geometric transformation of the Bayes decision boundary, our
method reformulates the problem as a low-dimensional empirical risk
minimization problem. Under mild regularity conditions, we establish the
consistency of our estimators and derive the risk bounds. Moreover, we
illustrate the broad applicability of our method by adapting it to the
estimation of optimal individualized treatment rules. Extensive simulation
studies and analyses of real-world data further demonstrate both superior
performance and robustness of our approach.

### [290] [Mitigating Distribution Shift in Stock Price Data via Return-Volatility Normalization for Accurate Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20108)
*Hyunwoo Lee,Jihyeong Jeon,Jaemin Hong,U Kang*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReVol, a method to improve stock price predictions disrupted by distribution shifts using normalization, attention modules, and model integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stock price prediction models struggle with distribution shifts between training and test data, weakening their predictive performance.

Method: ReVol uses feature normalization, attention-based modules for estimating sample characteristics, reintegrates traits, and combines Brownian motion modeling with neural networks for prediction.

Result: ReVol significantly improves prediction metrics like IC (>0.03) and SR (>0.7) across diverse datasets compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed ReVol approach effectively handles distribution shifts, showcasing enhanced stock prediction accuracy in various scenarios.

Abstract: How can we address distribution shifts in stock price data to improve stock
price prediction accuracy? Stock price prediction has attracted attention from
both academia and industry, driven by its potential to uncover complex market
patterns and enhance decisionmaking. However, existing methods often fail to
handle distribution shifts effectively, focusing on scaling or representation
adaptation without fully addressing distributional discrepancies and shape
misalignments between training and test data. We propose ReVol
(Return-Volatility Normalization for Mitigating Distribution Shift in Stock
Price Data), a robust method for stock price prediction that explicitly
addresses the distribution shift problem. ReVol leverages three key strategies
to mitigate these shifts: (1) normalizing price features to remove
sample-specific characteristics, including return, volatility, and price scale,
(2) employing an attention-based module to estimate these characteristics
accurately, thereby reducing the influence of market anomalies, and (3)
reintegrating the sample characteristics into the predictive process, restoring
the traits lost during normalization. Additionally, ReVol combines geometric
Brownian motion for long-term trend modeling with neural networks for
short-term pattern recognition, unifying their complementary strengths.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ReVol enhances
the performance of the state-of-the-art backbone models in most cases,
achieving an average improvement of more than 0.03 in IC and over 0.7 in SR
across various settings.

### [291] [Differentially Private Federated Quantum Learning via Quantum Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20310)
*Atit Pokharel,Ratun Rahman,Shaba Shaon,Thomas Morris,Dinh C. Nguyen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a differential privacy mechanism for quantum federated learning (QFL), using intrinsic quantum noise on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices to safeguard model updates during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of quantum federated learning models to adversarial attacks and the challenge of enforcing privacy using inherent quantum noise on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

Method: The study defines a novel differential privacy mechanism by adjusting quantum noise parameters like measurement shots and depolarizing channel strength, and investigates the trade-off between privacy and robustness.

Result: Simulations validate the framework's effectiveness in achieving differential privacy while safeguarding against adversarial attacks, showing tunable trade-offs between privacy levels and training accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables secure quantum federated learning on NISQ devices, balancing privacy and robustness, and unlocks potential for reliable quantum computing applications.

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) enables collaborative training of quantum
machine learning (QML) models across distributed quantum devices without raw
data exchange. However, QFL remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where
shared QML model updates can be exploited to undermine information privacy. In
the context of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, a key question
arises: How can inherent quantum noise be leveraged to enforce differential
privacy (DP) and protect model information during training and communication?
This paper explores a novel DP mechanism that harnesses quantum noise to
safeguard quantum models throughout the QFL process. By tuning noise variance
through measurement shots and depolarizing channel strength, our approach
achieves desired DP levels tailored to NISQ constraints. Simulations
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness by examining the relationship between
differential privacy budget and noise parameters, as well as the trade-off
between security and training accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate the
framework's robustness against an adversarial attack designed to compromise
model performance using adversarial examples, with evaluations based on
critical metrics such as accuracy on adversarial examples, confidence scores
for correct predictions, and attack success rates. The results reveal a tunable
trade-off between privacy and robustness, providing an efficient solution for
secure QFL on NISQ devices with significant potential for reliable quantum
computing applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLM performance in assisting developers by improving the quality and executability of Qiskit quantum code.

Method: They implemented quantum verification, created synthetic data pipelines, and trained LLMs using DPO and GRPO with quantum-verifiable rewards.

Result: The combined DPO and GRPO model outperformed open-source baselines on the Qiskit-HumanEval-hard benchmark.

Conclusion: Advanced training methods and quantum verification significantly enhance LLM-assisted development for quantum computing.

Abstract: Qiskit is an open-source quantum computing framework that allows users to
design, simulate, and run quantum circuits on real quantum hardware. We explore
post-training techniques for LLMs to assist in writing Qiskit code. We
introduce quantum verification as an effective method for ensuring code quality
and executability on quantum hardware. To support this, we developed a
synthetic data pipeline that generates quantum problem-unit test pairs and used
it to create preference data for aligning LLMs with DPO. Additionally, we
trained models using GRPO, leveraging quantum-verifiable rewards provided by
the quantum hardware. Our best-performing model, combining DPO and GRPO,
surpasses the strongest open-source baselines on the challenging
Qiskit-HumanEval-hard benchmark.

*Boaz Taitler,Omer Ben-Porat*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper examines the impact of Generative AI on collaborative work, highlighting its potential to alter worker effort and team dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Generative AI can reshape collaboration, productivity, and team management in mixed settings of human and AI involvement.

Method: A theoretical model was proposed where a manager selects a team to work with GenAI substituting for unselected workers. The model analyzes workers' effort levels and computational challenges in optimizing team selection.

Result: The study found that GenAI might discourage worker effort even when its efficacy is low. It also revealed that managing team selection with GenAI is computationally challenging, but efficient solutions exist for specific cases.

Conclusion: The inclusion or exclusion of workers, especially those of low perceived value, can critically impact team output and dynamics, emphasizing the importance of balanced collaboration strategies.

Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) is reshaping how workers contribute to
shared projects. While workers can use GenAI to boost productivity or reduce
effort, managers may use it to replace some workers entirely. We present a
theoretical framework to analyze how GenAI affects collaboration in such
settings. In our model, the manager selects a team to work on a shared task,
with GenAI substituting for unselected workers. Each worker selects how much
effort to exert, and incurs a cost that increases with the level of effort. We
show that GenAI can lead workers to exert no effort, even if GenAI is almost
ineffective. We further show that the manager's optimization problem is
NP-complete, and provide an efficient algorithm for the special class of
(almost-) linear instances. Our analysis shows that even workers with low
individual value may play a critical role in sustaining overall output, and
excluding such workers can trigger a cascade. Finally, we conduct extensive
simulations to illustrate our theoretical findings.

*Michal Bujak,Rafal Kucharski*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive pricing policy for ride-pooling systems to personalize fares, improving both user utility and operator profit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of individual pricing preferences in ride-pooling systems, aiming to balance perceived costs with attractive prices.

Method: An adaptive pricing policy that learns individual acceptance levels through daily offer adjustments, optimizing personalized fares over time.

Result: Over 90% accuracy in predicting pooled travelers' acceptance levels within 10 days, leading to increased demand, utility, and operator profit.

Conclusion: Learning individual traveler behavior can significantly enhance ride-pooling system efficiency and profitability while offering better user experiences.

Abstract: Ride-pooling systems, to succeed, must provide an attractive service, namely
compensate perceived costs with an appealing price. However, because of a
strong heterogeneity in a value-of-time, each traveller has his own acceptable
price, unknown to the operator. Here, we show that individual acceptance levels
can be learned by the operator (over $90\%$ accuracy for pooled travellers in
$10$ days) to optimise personalised fares. We propose an adaptive pricing
policy, where every day the operator constructs an offer that progressively
meets travellers' expectations and attracts a growing demand. Our results
suggest that operators, by learning behavioural traits of individual
travellers, may improve performance not only for travellers (increased utility)
but also for themselves (increased profit). Moreover, such knowledge allows the
operator to remove inefficient pooled rides and focus on attractive and
profitable combinations.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces a speech recognition dataset, OLMoASR-Pool, consisting of 3M hours of English audio and 17M transcripts, which is refined to create OLMoASR-Mix with 1M hours of high-quality pairs. It develops OLMoASR models, performing comparably to OpenAI's Whisper benchmarks, and makes resources publicly available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of exploration into the impact of large-scale, high-quality training data in speech recognition research.

Method: The paper relies on a curation pipeline involving heuristic filters to refine the dataset and trains OLMoASR models ranging from 39M to 1.5B parameters, evaluating their performance on speech benchmarks.

Result: OLMoASR models demonstrate performance comparable to OpenAI's Whisper models in both short and long-form speech recognition, with notable achievements in word error rates (WER).

Conclusion: OLMoASR-Pool, OLMoASR models, and associated code are openly provided to advance research in robust speech recognition techniques.

Abstract: Improvements in training data scale and quality have led to significant
advances, yet its influence in speech recognition remains underexplored. In
this paper, we present a large-scale dataset, OLMoASR-Pool, and series of
models, OLMoASR, to study and develop robust zero-shot speech recognition
models. Beginning from OLMoASR-Pool, a collection of 3M hours of English audio
and 17M transcripts, we design text heuristic filters to remove low-quality or
mistranscribed data. Our curation pipeline produces a new dataset containing 1M
hours of high-quality audio-transcript pairs, which we call OLMoASR-Mix. We use
OLMoASR-Mix to train the OLMoASR-Mix suite of models, ranging from 39M
(tiny.en) to 1.5B (large.en) parameters. Across all model scales, OLMoASR
achieves comparable average performance to OpenAI's Whisper on short and
long-form speech recognition benchmarks. Notably, OLMoASR-medium.en attains a
12.8\% and 11.0\% word error rate (WER) that is on par with Whisper's largest
English-only model Whisper-medium.en's 12.4\% and 10.5\% WER for short and
long-form recognition respectively (at equivalent parameter count).
OLMoASR-Pool, OLMoASR models, and filtering, training and evaluation code will
be made publicly available to further research on robust speech processing.

### [296] [Flowing Straighter with Conditional Flow Matching for Accurate Speech Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20584)
*Mattias Cross,Anton Ragni*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper studies the effect of probability path straightness in flow-based generative speech enhancement and proposes a solution using independent conditional flow-matching for better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While current flow-based speech enhancement methods show good performance, curved probability paths have unexplored implications. Straight paths may be easier to train and generalize better, prompting the need for a quantitative analysis.

Method: The authors investigated Schrodinger bridges to quantify path straightness and developed a novel independent conditional flow-matching method to model straight paths. They also introduced a one-step solution for inference to improve practicality.

Result: The paper finds that straighter paths, achieved through time-independent variance, yield better speech enhancement quality. Additionally, conditional flow-matching improves speech metrics but initially required multiple steps, which was alleviated by a one-step inference solution.

Conclusion: Straighter and time-independent probability paths improve generative speech enhancement quality, presenting a promising alternative to curved, time-dependent paths in this domain.

Abstract: Current flow-based generative speech enhancement methods learn curved
probability paths which model a mapping between clean and noisy speech. Despite
impressive performance, the implications of curved probability paths are
unknown. Methods such as Schrodinger bridges focus on curved paths, where
time-dependent gradients and variance do not promote straight paths. Findings
in machine learning research suggest that straight paths, such as conditional
flow matching, are easier to train and offer better generalisation. In this
paper we quantify the effect of path straightness on speech enhancement
quality. We report experiments with the Schrodinger bridge, where we show that
certain configurations lead to straighter paths. Conversely, we propose
independent conditional flow-matching for speech enhancement, which models
straight paths between noisy and clean speech. We demonstrate empirically that
a time-independent variance has a greater effect on sample quality than the
gradient. Although conditional flow matching improves several speech quality
metrics, it requires multiple inference steps. We rectify this with a one-step
solution by inferring the trained flow-based model as if it was directly
predictive. Our work suggests that straighter time-independent probability
paths improve generative speech enhancement over curved time-dependent paths.

### [297] [Amadeus: Autoregressive Model with Bidirectional Attribute Modelling for Symbolic Music](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20665)
*Hongju Su,Ke Li,Lan Yang,Honggang Zhang,Yi-Zhe Song*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces Amadeus, a new framework for symbolic music generation that uses a two-level model combining an autoregressive sequence approach with a bidirectional diffusion model for attributes. It significantly surpasses state-of-the-art models while allowing faster generation and fine-grained control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous symbolic music generation models overly rely on fixed dependency structures and temporal unidirectional dependencies, despite observations that music attributes are inherently unordered. The authors aim to redefine this paradigm.

Method: Amadeus employs a two-level architecture with an autoregressive model for sequencing and a bidirectional diffusion model for attributes. Performance is enhanced with a Music Latent Space Discriminability Enhancement Strategy (contrastive learning) and a Conditional Information Enhancement Module (attention mechanisms).

Result: Amadeus outperforms state-of-the-art models in both unconditional and text-conditioned symbolic music generation tasks, achieves a 4x speed-up, and supports training-free, precise note attribute control.

Conclusion: The Amadeus framework provides a novel and superior method for symbolic music generation. By challenging traditional architecture, it demonstrates more flexible, efficient, and controllable music generation, supported by the largest symbolic music dataset, AMD.

Abstract: Existing state-of-the-art symbolic music generation models predominantly
adopt autoregressive or hierarchical autoregressive architectures, modelling
symbolic music as a sequence of attribute tokens with unidirectional temporal
dependencies, under the assumption of a fixed, strict dependency structure
among these attributes. However, we observe that using different attributes as
the initial token in these models leads to comparable performance. This
suggests that the attributes of a musical note are, in essence, a concurrent
and unordered set, rather than a temporally dependent sequence. Based on this
insight, we introduce Amadeus, a novel symbolic music generation framework.
Amadeus adopts a two-level architecture: an autoregressive model for note
sequences and a bidirectional discrete diffusion model for attributes. To
enhance performance, we propose Music Latent Space Discriminability Enhancement
Strategy(MLSDES), incorporating contrastive learning constraints that amplify
discriminability of intermediate music representations. The Conditional
Information Enhancement Module (CIEM) simultaneously strengthens note latent
vector representation via attention mechanisms, enabling more precise note
decoding. We conduct extensive experiments on unconditional and
text-conditioned generation tasks. Amadeus significantly outperforms SOTA
models across multiple metrics while achieving at least 4$\times$ speed-up.
Furthermore, we demonstrate training-free, fine-grained note attribute control
feasibility using our model. To explore the upper performance bound of the
Amadeus architecture, we compile the largest open-source symbolic music dataset
to date, AMD (Amadeus MIDI Dataset), supporting both pre-training and
fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: MARVEL is a multitask learning framework designed for voice-based health assessment, capable of detecting nine diverse disorders using acoustic features without raw audio, showcasing high diagnostic performance on multiple conditions through a shared model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable voice-based scalable and non-invasive health diagnostics for multiple disorders, leveraging rich acoustic information while ensuring privacy and addressing limitations of single-condition models.

Method: Developed a multitask learning framework, MARVEL, using specialized encoders and a shared acoustic backbone to simultaneously screen for nine conditions using derived acoustic features, and tested on Bridge2AI-Voice v2.0 dataset.

Result: MARVEL achieved an overall AUROC of 0.78, excelling in neurological disorders (AUROC 0.89) and Alzheimer's/mild cognitive impairment (AUROC 0.97), outperforming single-modality baselines by 5–19% and surpassing state-of-the-art models on 7 of 9 tasks.

Conclusion: MARVEL demonstrates that a unified voice-based diagnostic model can effectively screen diverse medical conditions, with potential for deployment in resource-limited and remote health settings.

Abstract: Voice-based health assessment offers unprecedented opportunities for
scalable, non-invasive disease screening, yet existing approaches typically
focus on single conditions and fail to leverage the rich, multi-faceted
information embedded in speech. We present MARVEL (Multi-task Acoustic
Representations for Voice-based Health Analysis), a privacy-conscious multitask
learning framework that simultaneously detects nine distinct neurological,
respiratory, and voice disorders using only derived acoustic features,
eliminating the need for raw audio transmission. Our dual-branch architecture
employs specialized encoders with task-specific heads sharing a common acoustic
backbone, enabling effective cross-condition knowledge transfer. Evaluated on
the large-scale Bridge2AI-Voice v2.0 dataset, MARVEL achieves an overall AUROC
of 0.78, with exceptional performance on neurological disorders (AUROC = 0.89),
particularly for Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment (AUROC = 0.97).
Our framework consistently outperforms single-modal baselines by 5-19% and
surpasses state-of-the-art self-supervised models on 7 of 9 tasks, while
correlation analysis reveals that the learned representations exhibit
meaningful similarities with established acoustic features, indicating that the
model's internal representations are consistent with clinically recognized
acoustic patterns. By demonstrating that a single unified model can effectively
screen for diverse conditions, this work establishes a foundation for
deployable voice-based diagnostics in resource-constrained and remote
healthcare settings.

TL;DR: This paper explores using feature distillation during pretraining to develop spatial representations for binaural speech and demonstrates its effectiveness for direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation in challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the underexplored area of learning spatial representations from multichannel audio using deep learning, focusing on binaural speech.

Method: A pretraining stage via feature distillation is used to learn spatial representations from clean binaural speech. A neural network is trained to predict clean features from augmented speech. The learned encoder weights are then fine-tuned on a DoA estimation task.

Result: Pretrained models improve DoA estimation performance in noisy and reverberant environments compared to fully supervised models and conventional signal processing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed pretraining framework effectively enhances feature robustness for DoA estimation, demonstrating strong adaptability even in challenging acoustic conditions.

Abstract: Recently, deep representation learning has shown strong performance in
multiple audio tasks. However, its use for learning spatial representations
from multichannel audio is underexplored. We investigate the use of a
pretraining stage based on feature distillation to learn a robust spatial
representation of binaural speech without the need for data labels. In this
framework, spatial features are computed from clean binaural speech samples to
form prediction labels. These clean features are then predicted from
corresponding augmented speech using a neural network. After pretraining, we
throw away the spatial feature predictor and use the learned encoder weights to
initialize a DoA estimation model which we fine-tune for DoA estimation. Our
experiments demonstrate that the pretrained models show improved performance in
noisy and reverberant environments after fine-tuning for direction-of-arrival
estimation, when compared to fully supervised models and classic signal
processing methods.

*ChenYi Chua,JunKai Wong,Chengxin Chen,Xiaoxiao Miao*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for speech emotion recognition using multimodal predictions combining speech (wav2vec2.0) and text (RoBERTa-XLM) data, enhanced by entropy-aware score fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotion recognition from speech is challenging due to the limited reliability of single-modality systems. Leveraging multimodal data can improve prediction reliability, especially for complex datasets.

Method: The framework relies on two pipelines: an acoustic pipeline using wav2vec2.0 and a textual pipeline using Whisper-large-v3 for transcription and RoBERTa-XLM for sentiment analysis. Predictions are combined using entropy and varentropy-based score fusion.

Result: Experiments on the IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV datasets reveal improved performance compared to single-modality systems, demonstrating enhanced prediction reliability.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal predictions with entropy-aware scores significantly enhances the practicality and reliability of speech emotion recognition systems compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework for speech emotion
recognition that leverages entropy-aware score selection to combine speech and
textual predictions. The proposed method integrates a primary pipeline that
consists of an acoustic model based on wav2vec2.0 and a secondary pipeline that
consists of a sentiment analysis model using RoBERTa-XLM, with transcriptions
generated via Whisper-large-v3. We propose a late score fusion approach based
on entropy and varentropy thresholds to overcome the confidence constraints of
primary pipeline predictions. A sentiment mapping strategy translates three
sentiment categories into four target emotion classes, enabling coherent
integration of multimodal predictions. The results on the IEMOCAP and
MSP-IMPROV datasets show that the proposed method offers a practical and
reliable enhancement over traditional single-modality systems.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces the World-of-Whale benchmark to assess large audio language models' ability in fine-grained auditory perception and cognition using marine mammal sounds. Current models struggle at low-level auditory tasks and score far below human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-level auditory detection, such as pitch and duration understanding, is an underexplored but vital capability for Large Audio Language Models. This ability is essential for handling novel and unfamiliar sounds in real-world scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes the World-of-Whale benchmark (WoW-Bench) comprising two sub-benchmarks: Perception for novel sound categorization and Cognition, inspired by Bloom's taxonomy, to test memory, understanding, application, and analysis. Distractor questions are included to ensure true listening-based problem-solving.

Result: State-of-the-art Large Audio Language Models were tested on WoW-Bench and exhibited performance far below human levels, highlighting weaknesses in auditory grounding.

Conclusion: The study underscores the necessity for better auditory grounding in LALMs to improve their performance in fine-grained auditory tasks critical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large audio language models (LALMs) extend language understanding into the
auditory domain, yet their ability to perform low-level listening, such as
pitch and duration detection, remains underexplored. However, low-level
listening is critical for real-world, out-of-distribution tasks where models
must reason about unfamiliar sounds based on fine-grained acoustic cues. To
address this gap, we introduce the World-of-Whale benchmark (WoW-Bench) to
evaluate low-level auditory perception and cognition using marine mammal
vocalizations. WoW-bench is composed of a Perception benchmark for categorizing
novel sounds and a Cognition benchmark, inspired by Bloom's taxonomy, to assess
the abilities to remember, understand, apply, and analyze sound events. For the
Cognition benchmark, we additionally introduce distractor questions to evaluate
whether models are truly solving problems through listening rather than relying
on other heuristics. Experiments with state-of-the-art LALMs show performance
far below human levels, indicating a need for stronger auditory grounding in
LALMs.

### [302] [Latent Factor Point Processes for Patient Representation in Electronic Health Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20327)
*Parker Knight,Doudou Zhou,Zongqi Xia,Tianxi Cai,Junwei Lu*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model for analyzing electronic health records (EHR) that preserves temporal information and accurately identifies patterns in patient data using latent factor point processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR systems store valuable temporal patient data, but existing methods often simplify this information, losing temporal richness and clinical insights. The authors aim to address these limitations for enhanced understanding and application of patient-level data.

Method: The authors propose the latent factor point process model, which uses a low-dimensional latent Poisson process to represent high-dimensional EHR data, paired with Fourier-Eigen embeddings derived from spectral density matrices for patient representation.

Result: The framework shows improved statistical efficiency and captures subgroup-specific temporal patterns effectively. Application to Alzheimer’s EHR case studies demonstrated clinically relevant results and diagnostic insights.

Conclusion: This method preserves temporal richness, efficiently represents patients, and uncovers meaningful clinical patterns, offering advantages for classification, clustering, and longitudinal healthcare analysis.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHR) contain valuable longitudinal patient-level
information, yet most statistical methods reduce the irregular timing of EHR
codes into simple counts, thereby discarding rich temporal structure. Existing
temporal models often impose restrictive parametric assumptions or are tailored
to code level rather than patient-level tasks. We propose the latent factor
point process model, which represents code occurrences as a high-dimensional
point process whose conditional intensity is driven by a low dimensional latent
Poisson process. This low-rank structure reflects the clinical reality that
thousands of codes are governed by a small number of underlying disease
processes, while enabling statistically efficient estimation in high
dimensions. Building on this model, we introduce the Fourier-Eigen embedding, a
patient representation constructed from the spectral density matrix of the
observed process. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that these
embeddings efficiently capture subgroup-specific temporal patterns for
downstream classification and clustering. Simulations and an application to an
Alzheimer's disease EHR cohort demonstrate the practical advantages of our
approach in uncovering clinically meaningful heterogeneity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To aid users in better managing and achieving conversational goals during long and complex interactions with large language models.

Method: The OnGoal system offers real-time feedback on goal alignment, explanations with examples, and visual overviews of progression. It was compared to a baseline interface in a writing task study with 20 participants.

Result: Participants using OnGoal spent less effort and time achieving their goals, explored better strategies, and addressed miscommunications effectively.

Conclusion: Including goal tracking features in LLM interfaces improves user engagement, reduces cognitive load, and supports better interaction and feedback for goal-oriented tasks.

Abstract: As multi-turn dialogues with large language models (LLMs) grow longer and
more complex, how can users better evaluate and review progress on their
conversational goals? We present OnGoal, an LLM chat interface that helps users
better manage goal progress. OnGoal provides real-time feedback on goal
alignment through LLM-assisted evaluation, explanations for evaluation results
with examples, and overviews of goal progression over time, enabling users to
navigate complex dialogues more effectively. Through a study with 20
participants on a writing task, we evaluate OnGoal against a baseline chat
interface without goal tracking. Using OnGoal, participants spent less time and
effort to achieve their goals while exploring new prompting strategies to
overcome miscommunication, suggesting tracking and visualizing goals can
enhance engagement and resilience in LLM dialogues. Our findings inspired
design implications for future LLM chat interfaces that improve goal
communication, reduce cognitive load, enhance interactivity, and enable
feedback to improve LLM performance.

### [305] [Unifying Diarization, Separation, and ASR with Multi-Speaker Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20474)
*Muhammad Shakeel,Yui Sudo,Yifan Peng,Chyi-Jiunn Lin,Shinji Watanabe*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This study introduces UME, a unified encoder architecture designed to improve the performance of speaker diarization, speech separation, and multi-speaker ASR by leveraging shared foundational representations and joint training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in processing overlapping speech data and highlight the interdependencies among speaker diarization, speech separation, and multi-speaker ASR tasks.

Method: The UME utilizes a shared foundational encoder supported by residual weighted-sum encoding (RWSE) from multiple layers to integrate semantic information bottom-up across tasks, enabling joint training to capture task interdependencies.

Result: UME delivers superior performance against single-task baselines, achieving impressively low diarization error rates of 1.37% and 2.29% on the Libri2Mix and Libri3Mix datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: The unified architecture of UME substantially enhances the processing of overlapping speech and joint learning provides a scalable approach for multi-task integration in speech applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified multi-speaker encoder (UME), a novel
architecture that jointly learns representations for speaker diarization (SD),
speech separation (SS), and multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR)
tasks using a shared speech foundational encoder. We leverage the hidden
representations from multiple layers of UME as a residual weighted-sum encoding
(RWSE) to effectively use information from different semantic levels,
contributing to bottom-up alignment between tasks. This joint training approach
captures the inherent interdependencies among the tasks, enhancing overall
performance on overlapping speech data. Our evaluations demonstrate that UME
substantially improves over the single-task baselines dedicated to SD, SS, and
multi-speaker ASR on LibriMix evaluation sets. Notably, for SD, UME outperforms
the previous studies, achieving diarization error rates of 1.37% and 2.29% on
Libri2Mix and Libri3Mix evaluation sets, respectively.

### [306] [Is Audio Spoof Detection Robust to Laundering Attacks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14712)
*Hashim Ali,Surya Subramani,Shefali Sudhir,Raksha Varahamurthy,Hafiz Malik*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper examines the diminished performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) audio spoof detection systems when exposed to laundering attacks, using a newly created ASVSpoof Laundering Database.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the advancements in voice-cloning (VC) technology, its potential misuse raises significant ethical and security concerns. Current audio spoof detection systems are not robustly tested against real-world conditions like laundering attacks.

Method: The authors created a new database—ASVSpoof Laundering Database—derived from ASVSpoof 2019 and tested seven SOTA audio spoof detection approaches under various laundering attacks (e.g., reverberation and additive noise).

Result: The experiments revealed that SOTA spoof detection systems struggle when subjected to aggressive laundering attacks, showing poor performance compared to tests on clean datasets.

Conclusion: There is a pressing need to develop more robust audio spoof detection techniques to address laundering attacks and ensure reliable detection in real-world applications.

Abstract: Voice-cloning (VC) systems have seen an exceptional increase in the realism
of synthesized speech in recent years. The high quality of synthesized speech
and the availability of low-cost VC services have given rise to many potential
abuses of this technology. Several detection methodologies have been proposed
over the years that can detect voice spoofs with reasonably good accuracy.
However, these methodologies are mostly evaluated on clean audio databases,
such as ASVSpoof 2019. This paper evaluates SOTA Audio Spoof Detection
approaches in the presence of laundering attacks. In that regard, a new
laundering attack database, called the ASVSpoof Laundering Database, is
created. This database is based on the ASVSpoof 2019 (LA) eval database
comprising a total of 1388.22 hours of audio recordings. Seven SOTA audio spoof
detection approaches are evaluated on this laundered database. The results
indicate that SOTA systems perform poorly in the presence of aggressive
laundering attacks, especially reverberation and additive noise attacks. This
suggests the need for robust audio spoof detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to reduce labor and improve preventive maintenance for equipment inspections by replacing manual visual checks with IoT-driven solutions.

Method: The solution involves using cameras and microphones in 'NS' electric point machines to remotely monitor conditions and detect equipment failures through sound information, beginning in 2019.

Result: The proposed sound-based turnout error detection method showed expected test results, reducing equipment failure downtime and minimizing the need for manual visual inspections.

Conclusion: The method allows for real-time failure detection, contributing to automation and efficiency in inspecting electric point machines.

Abstract: Since 2018, East Japan Railway Company and Hitachi, Ltd. have been working to
replace human inspections with IoT-based monitoring. The purpose is
Labor-saving required for equipment inspections and provide appropriate
preventive maintenance. As an alternative to visual inspection, it has been
difficult to substitute electrical characteristic monitoring, and the
introduction of new high-performance sensors has been costly. In 2019, we
implemented cameras and microphones in an ``NS'' electric point machines to
reduce downtime from equipment failures, allowing for remote monitoring of
lock-piece conditions. This method for detecting turnout switching errors based
on sound information was proposed, and the expected test results were obtained.
The proposed method will make it possible to detect equipment failures in real
time, thereby reducing the need for visual inspections. This paper presents the
results of our technical studies aimed at automating the inspection of
electronic point machines using sound, specifically focusing on ``switch
sound'' beginning in 2019.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates large language models (LLMs) in analyzing U.S. tax-minimization strategies, demonstrating their capacity to discover novel approaches to tax strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LLMs can address complex real-world problems, specifically U.S. tax-minimization, and reduce revenue loss from well-advised taxpayers.

Method: Evaluated LLMs on their ability to verify, complete, and generate end-to-end tax strategies, leveraging their capability to process and navigate extensive tax law materials.

Result: The study revealed that LLMs could identify new and complete tax strategies, including a novel tax approach not previously recognized.

Conclusion: LLMs hold significant potential in aiding tax agencies to combat tax abuses and navigate challenging domains like U.S. tax law.

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models can discover and analyze U.S.
tax-minimization strategies. This real-world domain challenges even seasoned
human experts, and progress can reduce tax revenue lost from well-advised,
wealthy taxpayers. We evaluate the most advanced LLMs on their ability to (1)
interpret and verify tax strategies, (2) fill in gaps in partially specified
strategies, and (3) generate complete, end-to-end strategies from scratch. This
domain should be of particular interest to the LLM reasoning community: unlike
synthetic challenge problems or scientific reasoning tasks, U.S. tax law
involves navigating hundreds of thousands of pages of statutes, case law, and
administrative guidance, all updated regularly. Notably, LLM-based reasoning
identified an entirely novel tax strategy, highlighting these models' potential
to revolutionize tax agencies' fight against tax abuse.

and discuss research directions that promise further advancements. This
includes ML methods, such as graph neural networks and transformers, which can
be further advanced through the incorporation of physicochemical knowledge in a
hybrid or physics-informed fashion. Then, we consider leveraging molecular ML
at the chemical process scale, which is highly desirable yet rather unexplored.
We discuss how molecular ML can be integrated into process design and
optimization formulations, promising to accelerate the identification of novel
molecules and processes. To this end, it will be essential to create molecule

### [311] [MM-HSD: Multi-Modal Hate Speech Detection in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20546)
*Berta Céspedes-Sarrias,Carlos Collado-Capell,Pablo Rodenas-Ruiz,Olena Hrynenko,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper introduces MM-HSD, a model for hate speech detection in videos, integrating audio, video frames, and text through Cross-Modal Attention (CMA), achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for hate speech detection in multi-modal content, particularly in videos, often overlook key modalities like on-screen text and audio or fail to capture dependencies between modalities effectively.

Method: The paper proposes MM-HSD, a model that leverages video frames, audio, speech transcripts, and on-screen text with Cross-Modal Attention (CMA) as an early feature extractor to enhance multi-modal hate speech detection.

Result: MM-HSD achieves a competitive M-F1 score of 0.874 on the HateMM dataset by combining all modalities and applying CMA for feature extraction.

Conclusion: MM-HSD demonstrates the importance of using on-screen text and Cross-Modal Attention for efficient inter-modal interaction, outperforming previous methods in multi-modal hate speech detection in videos.

Abstract: While hate speech detection (HSD) has been extensively studied in text,
existing multi-modal approaches remain limited, particularly in videos. As
modalities are not always individually informative, simple fusion methods fail
to fully capture inter-modal dependencies. Moreover, previous work often omits
relevant modalities such as on-screen text and audio, which may contain subtle
hateful content and thus provide essential cues, both individually and in
combination with others. In this paper, we present MM-HSD, a multi-modal model
for HSD in videos that integrates video frames, audio, and text derived from
speech transcripts and from frames (i.e.~on-screen text) together with features
extracted by Cross-Modal Attention (CMA). We are the first to use CMA as an
early feature extractor for HSD in videos, to systematically compare query/key
configurations, and to evaluate the interactions between different modalities
in the CMA block. Our approach leads to improved performance when on-screen
text is used as a query and the rest of the modalities serve as a key.
Experiments on the HateMM dataset show that MM-HSD outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on M-F1 score (0.874), using concatenation of transcript, audio, video,
on-screen text, and CMA for feature extraction on raw embeddings of the
modalities. The code is available at https://github.com/idiap/mm-hsd

### [312] [Operator learning meets inverse problems: A probabilistic perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20207)
*Nicholas H. Nelsen,Yunan Yang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The chapter examines operator learning for solving inverse problems, focusing on end-to-end methods and measure-centric formulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the use of operator learning techniques for solving complex inverse problems efficiently and robustly, particularly in noisy data settings.

Method: The chapter analyzes probabilistic and deterministic approaches to inverse problems and explores end-to-end operator learning methods, structure-aware architectures, and classical estimation techniques.

Result: It identifies challenges like noise in data-driven inversion and surveys theoretical frameworks and architectural innovations to address linear and nonlinear inverse problems.

Conclusion: Operator learning holds promise as a versatile tool for tackling inverse problems, blending new paradigms with classical methods to account for noise and uncertainty effectively.

Abstract: Operator learning offers a robust framework for approximating mappings
between infinite-dimensional function spaces. It has also become a powerful
tool for solving inverse problems in the computational sciences. This chapter
surveys methodological and theoretical developments at the intersection of
operator learning and inverse problems. It begins by summarizing the
probabilistic and deterministic approaches to inverse problems, and pays
special attention to emerging measure-centric formulations that treat observed
data or unknown parameters as probability distributions. The discussion then
turns to operator learning by covering essential components such as data
generation, loss functions, and widely used architectures for representing
function-to-function maps. The core of the chapter centers on the end-to-end
inverse operator learning paradigm, which aims to directly map observed data to
the solution of the inverse problem without requiring explicit knowledge of the
forward map. It highlights the unique challenge that noise plays in this
data-driven inversion setting, presents structure-aware architectures for both
point predictions and posterior estimates, and surveys relevant theory for
linear and nonlinear inverse problems. The chapter also discusses the
estimation of priors and regularizers, where operator learning is used more
selectively within classical inversion algorithms.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Long video generation requires improved memory handling; the proposed Mixture of Contexts (MoC) module addresses this with sparse attention routing for efficient and consistent long-term video synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating long-context videos without computational collapse or memory inefficiency due to the quadratic cost of self-attention in diffusion transformers.

Method: The MoC module dynamically selects and attends to a few informative memory chunks and mandatory anchors, utilizing sparse attention routing with causal routing to ensure computational efficiency and long-term coherence.

Result: The model achieves near-linear scaling in resource usage, efficiently maintaining identities, actions, and scenes over minutes of generated video content.

Conclusion: The MoC module enables practical training and synthesis of long videos with improved efficiency and memory consistency, marking a step forward in long-context video generation.

Abstract: Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models
must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing
or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context
videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which
makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long
sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information
retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module,
Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine.
In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory
anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that
prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the
routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities,
actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct
of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and
synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.

*Francesco Prignoli,Francesco Borrelli,Paolo Falcone,Mark Pustilnik*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a motion planning system for autonomous racing that integrates regulations into a game-theoretic framework to enhance safe and effective overtaking strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the need for safe, regulation-compliant motion planning in competitive autonomous racing, where traditional models often ignore racing rules or interactions with other agents.

Method: The authors frame motion planning as a Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem, incorporate regulations via Mixed Logical Dynamical constraints, and solve this problem iteratively. The resulting Regulation-Aware Game-Theoretic Planner reasons over adversaries' constrained behavior to create overtaking strategies.

Result: Simulations show that the proposed RA-GTP system outperforms rule-agnostic or non-interactive models, yielding safer and more effective maneuvers that adhere to racing regulations.

Conclusion: The RA-GTP framework successfully integrates regulatory compliance and interaction modeling into autonomous racing, enabling superior and safer planning over baseline methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a regulation-aware motion planning framework for
autonomous racing scenarios. Each agent solves a Regulation-Compliant Model
Predictive Control problem, where racing rules - such as right-of-way and
collision avoidance responsibilities - are encoded using Mixed Logical
Dynamical constraints. We formalize the interaction between vehicles as a
Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP) and approximate its solution using
an Iterative Best Response scheme. Building on this, we introduce the
Regulation-Aware Game-Theoretic Planner (RA-GTP), in which the attacker reasons
over the defender's regulation-constrained behavior. This game-theoretic layer
enables the generation of overtaking strategies that are both safe and
non-conservative. Simulation results demonstrate that the RA-GTP outperforms
baseline methods that assume non-interacting or rule-agnostic opponent models,
leading to more effective maneuvers while consistently maintaining compliance
with racing regulations.

*Xianyue Peng,Shenyang Chen,H. Michael Zhang*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hierarchical traffic signal coordination scheme featuring model-based optimization and reinforcement learning to address urban traffic challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the dual challenge in urban traffic signal control: maintaining arterial progression and adapting to varying local demand.

Method: The method involves hierarchical reinforcement learning with Proximal Policy Optimization, integrating three components: a High-Level Coordinator, Corridor Coordinator, and Hybrid Signal Agents.

Result: Case studies show that different strategies (MFC, GWC, PAC) perform well under specific traffic conditions, enabling tailored responses to demand levels.

Conclusion: The hierarchical framework effectively balances corridor and network performance, making it adaptable across diverse traffic scenarios.

Abstract: Signal control in urban corridors faces the dual challenge of maintaining
arterial traffic progression while adapting to demand variations at local
intersections. We propose a hierarchical traffic signal coordination and
control scheme that integrates model-based optimization with reinforcement
learning. The system consists of: (i) a High-Level Coordinator (HLC) that
selects coordination strategies based on observed and predicted demand; (ii) a
Corridor Coordinator that derives phase constraints from the selected
strategy-either Max-Flow Coordination (MFC) or Green-Wave Coordination (GWC);
and (iii) Hybrid Signal Agents (HSAs) that determine signal phases via
reinforcement learning with action masking to enforce feasibility. Hierarchical
reinforcement learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is used to train
HSA and HLC policies. At the lower level, three HSA policies-MFC-aware,
GWC-aware, and pure agent control (PAC) are trained in conjunction with their
respective coordination strategies. At the higher level, the HLC is trained to
dynamically switch strategies using a multi-objective reward balancing
corridor-level and network-wide performance. The proposed scheme was developed
and evaluated on a SUMO-RLlib platform. Case results show that hybrid MFC
maximizes throughput under heavy demand; hybrid GWC consistently minimizes
arterial stops and maintains progression across diverse traffic conditions but
can reduce network-wide efficiency; and PAC improves network-wide travel time
in moderate demand but is less effective under heavy demand. The hierarchical
design enables adaptive strategy selection, achieving robust performance across
all demand levels.

*Zhuoyuan Wang,Raffaele Romagnoli,Kamyar Azizzadenesheli,Yorie Nakahira*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper introduces Neural Spline Operators (NeSO), a physics-informed neural operator framework, for quantifying risk probabilities in systems with functional and dynamic variations, enhancing training efficiency and condition enforcement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with complex and varying system dynamics when quantifying long-term risk in stochastic systems, highlighting the need for more robust approaches.

Method: The authors proposed Neural Spline Operators (NeSO), which integrate B-spline representations within physics-informed neural operator methods to quantify risks effectively. The approach leverages theoretical guarantees and practical benchmarks.

Result: NeSO demonstrated universal approximation capabilities, efficiency in online implementation, and significant improvements over existing methods in two case studies involving functional dynamics and multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: The framework contributes to the field by providing a scalable and accurate risk quantification method, potentially benefiting broader control and PDE-related challenges.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying long-term risk probabilities in diverse stochastic
systems is essential for safety-critical control. However, existing
sampling-based and partial differential equation (PDE)-based methods often
struggle to handle complex varying dynamics. Physics-informed neural networks
learn surrogate mappings for risk probabilities from varying system parameters
of fixed and finite dimensions, yet can not account for functional variations
in system dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce physics-informed
neural operator (PINO) methods to risk quantification problems, to learn
mappings from varying \textit{functional} system dynamics to corresponding risk
probabilities. Specifically, we propose Neural Spline Operators (NeSO), a PINO
framework that leverages B-spline representations to improve training
efficiency and achieve better initial and boundary condition enforcements,
which are crucial for accurate risk quantification. We provide theoretical
analysis demonstrating the universal approximation capability of NeSO. We also
present two case studies, one with varying functional dynamics and another with
high-dimensional multi-agent dynamics, to demonstrate the efficacy of NeSO and
its significant online speed-up over existing methods. The proposed framework
and the accompanying universal approximation theorem are expected to be
beneficial for other control or PDE-related problems beyond risk
quantification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to solve the challenge of implementing predictor feedback controllers in nonlinear systems with unknown and arbitrarily long actuator delays, which are difficult to address analytically.

Method: The method introduces an offline-trained neural operator to approximate a predictor for these systems, providing theoretical stability analysis using the universal approximation theorem and Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals.

Result: Validated on a biological system, the method achieves significant speedups (15 times faster) over traditional numerical approaches while maintaining convergence and stability.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses actuator delays in nonlinear systems using neural operators, offering both computational efficiency and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a rigorous method for implementing predictor
feedback controllers in nonlinear systems with unknown and arbitrarily long
actuator delays. To address the analytically intractable nature of the
predictor, we approximate it using a learned neural operator mapping. This
mapping is trained once, offline, and then deployed online, leveraging the fast
inference capabilities of neural networks. We provide a theoretical stability
analysis based on the universal approximation theorem of neural operators and
the transport partial differential equation (PDE) representation of the delay.
We then prove, via a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, semi-global practical
convergence of the dynamical system dependent on the approximation error of the
predictor and delay bounds. Finally, we validate our theoretical results using
a biological activator/repressor system, demonstrating speedups of 15 times
compared to traditional numerical methods.

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of DNN inferencing accuracy degradation in ReRAM hardware due to stochastic noise. It proposes a noise-aware training method and an optimization algorithm to effectively design high-performance hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to tackle the challenge of stochastic noise in ReRAM crossbars which negatively affects DNN inferencing accuracy, and to optimize hardware design for accuracy and efficiency.

Method: The authors proposed ReSNA, a noise-aware training method, and CF-MESMO, an information-theoretic optimization algorithm to trade off multiple objectives such as accuracy, area, execution time, and energy. A continuous-fidelity evaluation approach is employed to handle computational cost challenges.

Result: The proposed method achieved a 2.57% improvement in inferencing accuracy for ResNet20 on CIFAR-10 and reduced computation costs by 90.91% compared to NSGA-II for multi-objective optimization.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that their noise-aware training and optimization techniques can robustly improve DNN accuracy and reduce computation costs, offering a valuable strategy for ReRAM-based hardware design when stochastic noise is present.

Abstract: Resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) is a promising technology for
designing hardware accelerators for deep neural network (DNN) inferencing.
However, stochastic noise in ReRAM crossbars can degrade the DNN inferencing
accuracy. We propose the design and optimization of a high-performance,
area-and energy-efficient ReRAM-based hardware accelerator to achieve robust
DNN inferencing in the presence of stochastic noise. We make two key technical
contributions. First, we propose a stochastic-noise-aware training method,
referred to as ReSNA, to improve the accuracy of DNN inferencing on ReRAM
crossbars with stochastic noise. Second, we propose an information-theoretic
algorithm, referred to as CF-MESMO, to identify the Pareto set of solutions to
trade-off multiple objectives, including inferencing accuracy, area overhead,
execution time, and energy consumption. The main challenge in this context is
that executing the ReSNA method to evaluate each candidate ReRAM design is
prohibitive. To address this challenge, we utilize the continuous-fidelity
evaluation of ReRAM designs associated with prohibitive high computation cost
by varying the number of training epochs to trade-off accuracy and cost.
CF-MESMO iteratively selects the candidate ReRAM design and fidelity pair that
maximizes the information gained per unit computation cost about the optimal
Pareto front. Our experiments on benchmark DNNs show that the proposed

### [319] [MicroLad: 2D-to-3D Microstructure Reconstruction and Generation via Latent Diffusion and Score Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20138)
*Kang-Hyun Lee,Faez Ahmed*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: This paper introduces MicroLad, a framework that uses latent diffusion models to generate 3D microstructures from 2D data, addressing challenges in materials engineering like limited datasets and poor control over microstructure design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to overcome obstacles in establishing reliable structure-property linkages due to the lack of diverse 3D microstructure datasets and limited exploration of design spaces.

Method: MicroLad employs latent diffusion-based reconstruction augmented with multi-plane denoising diffusion sampling and score distillation sampling for generating coherent 3D microstructures based on 2D data.

Result: MicroLad successfully generates statistically consistent 3D volumes from 2D data and permits guided generation aligned with descriptors and material properties.

Conclusion: The framework expands the scope for 3D microstructure analysis and design, enabling inverse-controlled 2D-to-3D microstructure generation with broader exploration capabilities.

Abstract: A major obstacle to establishing reliable structure-property (SP) linkages in
materials engineering is the scarcity of diverse 3D microstructure datasets.
Limited dataset availability and insufficient control over the analysis and
design space restrict the variety of achievable microstructure morphologies,
hindering progress in solving the inverse (property-to-structure) design
problem. To address these challenges, we introduce MicroLad, a latent diffusion
framework specifically designed for reconstructing 3D microstructures from 2D
data. Trained on 2D images and employing multi-plane denoising diffusion
sampling in the latent space, the framework reliably generates stable and
coherent 3D volumes that remain statistically consistent with the original
data. While this reconstruction capability enables dimensionality expansion
(2D-to-3D) for generating statistically equivalent 3D samples from 2D data,
effective exploration of microstructure design requires methods to guide the
generation process toward specific objectives. To achieve this, MicroLad
integrates score distillation sampling (SDS), which combines a differentiable
score loss with microstructural descriptor-matching and property-alignment
terms. This approach updates encoded 2D slices of the 3D volume in the latent
space, enabling robust inverse-controlled 2D-to-3D microstructure generation.
Consequently, the method facilitates exploration of an expanded 3D
microstructure analysis and design space in terms of both microstructural
descriptors and material properties.

### [320] [Studying Effective String Theory using deep generative models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20610)
*Michele Caselle,Elia Cellini,Alessandro Nada*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper investigates using Effective String Theory (EST) to describe quark confinement and introduces deep learning to solve analytical challenges, particularly focusing on flux tube width.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in describing confinement in Yang-Mills theory with Effective String Theory, focusing on problems like calculating the flux tube width, which are difficult to solve analytically.

Method: The paper combines Effective String Theory with numerical methods based on deep learning and generative algorithms to overcome analytical challenges.

Result: Results are presented for the width of the Nambu-Goto Effective String Theory's flux tube, using the introduced numerical methods.

Conclusion: The study showcases the capability of deep learning techniques to enhance EST calculations and addresses complex analytical problems, such as the flux tube width determination.

Abstract: Effective String Theory (EST) offers a robust non-perturbative framework for
describing confinement in Yang-Mills theory by treating the confining flux tube
between a static quark-antiquark pair as a thin, vibrating string. While EST
calculations are typically carried out using zeta-function regularization,
certain problems-such as determining the flux tube width-are too complex to
solve analytically. However, recent studies have demonstrated that EST can be
explored numerically by employing deep learning techniques based on generative
algorithms. In this work, we provide a brief introduction to EST and this novel
numerical approach. Finally, we present results for the width of the
Nambu-Got\"o EST.

### [321] [The Mathematician's Assistant: Integrating AI into Research Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20236)
*Jonas Henkel*

Main category: math.HO

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of large language models (LLMs) on mathematical research, noting their strengths and systematic flaws. A framework based on 'augmented mathematician' is proposed to integrate AI in research workflows responsibly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how AI, particularly large language models, can alter mathematical research practices, identify their current capabilities, limitations, and propose a strategic framework for integration.

Method: The paper analyzes benchmarks like MathArena and Open Proof Corpus, identifies the strengths and flaws of state-of-the-art LLMs, and develops a framework with guiding principles for AI's use in research.

Result: The study finds that LLMs excel in problem-solving and proof evaluation but exhibit flaws like lack of self-critique and discrepancy between answer accuracy and proof validity. A framework for integrating AI in research is proposed with practical applications.

Conclusion: AI's role in mathematics is seen as augmentative rather than fully automating. Effective use demands new skills such as strategic prompting and critical analysis.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), marked by
breakthroughs like 'AlphaEvolve' and 'Gemini Deep Think', is beginning to offer
powerful new tools that have the potential to significantly alter the research
practice in many areas of mathematics. This paper explores the current
landscape of publicly accessible large language models (LLMs) in a mathematical
research context, based on developments up to August 2, 2025. Our analysis of
recent benchmarks, such as MathArena and the Open Proof Corpus (Balunovi\'c et
al., 2025; Dekoninck et al., 2025), reveals a complex duality: while
state-of-the-art models demonstrate strong abilities in solving problems and
evaluating proofs, they also exhibit systematic flaws, including a lack of
self-critique and a model depending discrepancy between final-answer accuracy
and full-proof validity.
  Based on these findings, we propose a durable framework for integrating AI
into the research workflow, centered on the principle of the augmented
mathematician. In this model, the AI functions as a copilot under the critical
guidance of the human researcher, an approach distilled into five guiding
principles for effective and responsible use. We then systematically explore
seven fundamental ways AI can be applied across the research lifecycle, from
creativity and ideation to the final writing process, demonstrating how these
principles translate into concrete practice.
  We conclude that the primary role of AI is currently augmentation rather than
automation. This requires a new skill set focused on strategic prompting,
critical verification, and methodological rigor in order to effectively use
these powerful tools.

### [322] [FlowMalTrans: Unsupervised Binary Code Translation for Malware Detection Using Flow-Adapter Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20212)
*Minghao Hu,Junzhe Wang,Weisen Zhao,Qiang Zeng,Lannan Luo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to enhance malware detection across multiple ISAs using deep learning. It leverages Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Normalizing Flows (NFs) to translate malware data from one ISA to another, reducing the need for extensive data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of detecting malware across multiple ISAs without the labor-intensive process of collecting and labeling samples for each ISA.

Method: The paper proposes using Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to transform malware from one ISA to another where sufficient labeled samples are available. Normalizing Flows (NFs) are utilized to support this translation and enable cross-ISA malware detection.

Result: It shows that the proposed technique allows deep learning models trained for one ISA to effectively detect malware for other ISAs, significantly cutting down the data collection effort.

Conclusion: The approach facilitates scalable, efficient, and multi-ISA compatible malware detection by leveraging a single ISA-trained model, addressing one of the pressing challenges in IoT cybersecurity.

Abstract: Applying deep learning to malware detection has drawn great attention due to
its notable performance. With the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks
targeting IoT devices, there is a parallel rise in the development of malware
across various Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs). It is thus important to
extend malware detection capacity to multiple ISAs. However, training a deep
learning-based malware detection model usually requires a large number of
labeled malware samples. The process of collecting and labeling sufficient
malware samples to build datasets for each ISA is labor-intensive and
time-consuming. To reduce the burden of data collection, we propose to leverage
the ideas of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Normalizing Flows (NFs) for
malware detection. Specifically, when dealing with malware in a certain ISA, we
translate it to an ISA with sufficient malware samples (like X86-64). This
allows us to apply a model trained on one ISA to analyze malware from another
ISA. Our approach reduces the data collection effort by enabling malware
detection across multiple ISAs using a model trained on a single ISA.

*Weijie Liu,Hongbo Chen,Shuo Huai,Zhen Xu,Wenhao Wang,Zhi Li,Zheli Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effectiveness of TEE containers, highlights their security shortcomings, and proposes guidelines and insights for improved design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze and improve the security and reliability of TEE containers designed to protect applications against malicious systems and interfaces.

Method: Developed an automated analyzer to evaluate isolation strategies and identify flaws in existing TEE containers.

Result: Found critical design and implementation flaws in some TEE containers, leading to security risks such as information leakage, rollback attacks, denial-of-service, and Iago attacks.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights and recommendations for designing more secure TEE container solutions, emphasizing the need for addressing identified vulnerabilities and exploring new design trends.

Abstract: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have emerged as a cornerstone of
confidential computing, garnering significant attention from both academia and
industry. To enable the secure development, execution, and deployment, of
applications on TEE platforms, TEE containers have been introduced as
middleware solutions. These containers aim to shield applications from
potentially malicious operating systems and orchestration interfaces while
maintaining usability and reliability. In this paper, we analyze the isolation
strategies employed by existing TEE containers to protect secure applications.
To address the challenges in analyzing these interfaces, we designed an
automated analyzer to precisely identify and evaluate their isolation
boundaries. We observed that some TEE containers fail to achieve their intended
goals due to critical design and implementation flaws, such as information
leakage, rollback attacks, denial-of-service, and Iago attacks, which pose
significant security risks. Drawing from our findings, we share key lessons to
guide the development of more secure container solutions and discuss emerging
trends in TEE containerization design.

### [324] [AI Propaganda factories with language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20186)
*Lukasz Olejnik*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores how small language models can generate automated, persona-driven political messaging, revealing behavioral patterns and offering insights for defense strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the viability and impact of AI-powered, automated influence operations using small language models.

Method: Experimentation to observe behavioral outcomes when generating persona-driven political messages using small language models.

Result: Key findings include persona playing a larger role in behavior than the model itself, and higher engagement strengthening ideological adherence and extreme content.

Conclusion: Fully automated AI influence operations are feasible for even small-scale actors. Defense should focus on detecting and disrupting coordinated campaigns rather than solely restricting model access.

Abstract: AI-powered influence operations can now be executed end-to-end on commodity
hardware. We show that small language models produce coherent, persona-driven
political messaging and can be evaluated automatically without human raters.
Two behavioural findings emerge. First, persona-over-model: persona design
explains behaviour more than model identity. Second, engagement as a stressor:
when replies must counter-arguments, ideological adherence strengthens and the
prevalence of extreme content increases. We demonstrate that fully automated
influence-content production is within reach of both large and small actors.
Consequently, defence should shift from restricting model access towards
conversation-centric detection and disruption of campaigns and coordination
infrastructure. Paradoxically, the very consistency that enables these
operations also provides a detection signature.

*Hyejun Jeong,Mohammadreze Teymoorianfard,Abhinav Kumar,Amir Houmansadr,Eugene Badasarian*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper highlights vulnerabilities in Web and Research Agents (WRAs) to inference attacks that exploit network metadata like visited IP addresses and timings, enabling fingerprinting of user prompts and traits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate potential privacy risks posed by Web and Research Agents (WRAs) given their intensive browsing patterns, which create opportunities for passive network adversaries to conduct inference attacks.

Method: The authors introduced a novel prompt and user trait leakage attack using network metadata from WRAs. They created a new dataset of WRA browsing traces based on real and synthetic queries, defined a behavioral similarity metric (OBELS), and analyzed attack effectiveness under various conditions.

Result: The attack achieves 73% recovery of user prompt functional and domain knowledge, and in multi-session settings, identifies up to 19 out of 32 latent user traits accurately. Mitigation strategies reduce attack success by 29% with minimal impact on utility.

Conclusion: WRAs are susceptible to network-level inference attacks, but strategies like constraining domain diversity or obfuscating traces can mitigate risks while maintaining functionality.

Abstract: We show that Web and Research Agents (WRAs) -- language model-based systems
that investigate complex topics on the Internet -- are vulnerable to inference
attacks by passive network adversaries such as ISPs. These agents could be
deployed \emph{locally} by organizations and individuals for privacy, legal, or
financial purposes. Unlike sporadic web browsing by humans, WRAs visit
$70{-}140$ domains with distinguishable timing correlations, enabling unique
fingerprinting attacks.
  Specifically, we demonstrate a novel prompt and user trait leakage attack
against WRAs that only leverages their network-level metadata (i.e., visited IP
addresses and their timings). We start by building a new dataset of WRA traces
based on user search queries and queries generated by synthetic personas. We
define a behavioral metric (called OBELS) to comprehensively assess similarity
between original and inferred prompts, showing that our attack recovers over
73\% of the functional and domain knowledge of user prompts. Extending to a
multi-session setting, we recover up to 19 of 32 latent traits with high
accuracy. Our attack remains effective under partial observability and noisy
conditions. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies that constrain domain
diversity or obfuscate traces, showing negligible utility impact while reducing
attack effectiveness by an average of 29\%.

*Xia Han,Qi Li,Jianbing Ni,Mohammad Zulkernine*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper critiques SynthID-Text for its vulnerability to meaning-preserving attacks and introduces SynGuard, a hybrid framework improving watermark robustness by integrating semantic and lexical embedding techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current watermark methods for AI-generated text, such as SynthID-Text, lack robustness against meaning-preserving modifications like paraphrasing or back-translation, necessitating advanced solutions.

Method: SynGuard uses a hybrid approach by combining semantic alignment techniques (via Semantic Information Retrieval) with probabilistic watermarking, embedding watermarks at both semantic and lexical levels.

Result: SynGuard demonstrates a significant improvement, with an 11.1% average increase in F1 score for watermark recovery across multiple attack scenarios compared to SynthID-Text.

Conclusion: SynGuard achieves superior robustness in provenance tracking of AI-generated text, highlighting the potential of semantic-aware watermarking to resist real-world tampering.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM watermarking methods such as SynthID-Text by Google
DeepMind offer promising solutions for tracing the provenance of AI-generated
text. However, our robustness assessment reveals that SynthID-Text is
vulnerable to meaning-preserving attacks, such as paraphrasing, copy-paste
modifications, and back-translation, which can significantly degrade watermark
detectability. To address these limitations, we propose SynGuard, a hybrid
framework that combines the semantic alignment strength of Semantic Information
Retrieval (SIR) with the probabilistic watermarking mechanism of SynthID-Text.
Our approach jointly embeds watermarks at both lexical and semantic levels,
enabling robust provenance tracking while preserving the original meaning.
Experimental results across multiple attack scenarios show that SynGuard
improves watermark recovery by an average of 11.1\% in F1 score compared to
SynthID-Text. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of semantic-aware
watermarking in resisting real-world tampering. All code, datasets, and
evaluation scripts are publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cybersecurity assessments fail to address the unique threats of AI-integration, highlighting a critical gap in defending these systems.

Method: The authors analyze operational and supply chain risks across the AI lifecycle, referencing past exploitations and insights gained from experience.

Result: The paper identifies new risks in AI-driven systems, such as performance manipulation and false outputs, showcasing the vulnerabilities of AI's unique architecture.

Conclusion: Organizations must adopt customized security frameworks to safeguard AI systems, ensuring their resilience and reliability against evolving cyber threats.

Abstract: The rise of AI has transformed the software and hardware landscape, enabling
powerful capabilities through specialized infrastructures, large-scale data
storage, and advanced hardware. However, these innovations introduce unique
attack surfaces and objectives which traditional cybersecurity assessments
often overlook. Cyber attackers are shifting their objectives from conventional
goals like privilege escalation and network pivoting to manipulating AI outputs
to achieve desired system effects, such as slowing system performance, flooding
outputs with false positives, or degrading model accuracy. This paper serves to
raise awareness of the novel cyber threats that are introduced when
incorporating AI into a software system. We explore the operational
cybersecurity and supply chain risks across the AI lifecycle, emphasizing the
need for tailored security frameworks to address evolving threats in the
AI-driven landscape. We highlight previous exploitations and provide insights
from working in this area. By understanding these risks, organizations can
better protect AI systems and ensure their reliability and resilience.

*Dan Lin,Shunfeng Lu,Ziyan Liu,Jiajing Wu,Junyuan Fang,Kaixin Lin,Bowen Song,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents BridgeShield, a detection framework for securing cross-chain blockchain bridges, achieving an F1-score of 92.58% to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the inadequacy of existing detection methods, which focus on single-chain behaviors and fail to capture cross-chain semantics despite the vulnerability of cross-chain bridges to hacker attacks.

Method: The method involves leveraging heterogeneous graph attention networks suitable for modeling multi-typed entities and relations in cross-chain behaviors. The framework, called BridgeShield, uses a unified heterogeneous graph representation incorporating intra-meta-path and inter-meta-path attention mechanisms.

Result: The results show that BridgeShield achieves an average F1-score of 92.58%, marking a significant 24.39% improvement over state-of-the-art baseline methods.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that BridgeShield provides an effective, practical solution for securing cross-chain bridges and improving the resilience of multi-chain blockchain ecosystems.

Abstract: Cross-chain bridges play a vital role in enabling blockchain
interoperability. However, due to the inherent design flaws and the enormous
value they hold, they have become prime targets for hacker attacks. Existing
detection methods show progress yet remain limited, as they mainly address
single-chain behaviors and fail to capture cross-chain semantics. To address
this gap, we leverage heterogeneous graph attention networks, which are
well-suited for modeling multi-typed entities and relations, to capture the
complex execution semantics of cross-chain behaviors. We propose BridgeShield,
a detection framework that jointly models the source chain, off-chain
coordination, and destination chain within a unified heterogeneous graph
representation. BridgeShield incorporates intra-meta-path attention to learn
fine-grained dependencies within cross-chain paths and inter-meta-path
attention to highlight discriminative cross-chain patterns, thereby enabling
precise identification of attack behaviors. Extensive experiments on 51
real-world cross-chain attack events demonstrate that BridgeShield achieves an
average F1-score of 92.58%, representing a 24.39% improvement over
state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate the effectiveness of
BridgeShield as a practical solution for securing cross-chain bridges and
enhancing the resilience of multi-chain ecosystems.

TL;DR: The paper reviews Federated Learning (FL) in medical imaging, offering privacy-preserving AI model training across distributed datasets and analyzing FL's role in upstream and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of developing AI models in medical imaging caused by patient privacy regulations and data-sharing restrictions.

Method: Survey and analysis of FL's application in the medical imaging pipeline, focusing on upstream reconstruction tasks and downstream clinical tasks like diagnosis and segmentation.

Result: Federated Learning enables robust and privacy-preserving collaborations on large-scale, multi-institutional datasets, thus improving the training and adaptation of AI models in medical imaging.

Conclusion: FL is a promising framework for overcoming data privacy challenges in medical imaging, with potential across the full-stack analysis pipeline, and future research opportunities are outlined to advance its application.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated considerable potential in the
realm of medical imaging. However, the development of high-performance AI
models typically necessitates training on large-scale, centralized datasets.
This approach is confronted with significant challenges due to strict patient
privacy regulations and legal restrictions on data sharing and utilization.
These limitations hinder the development of large-scale models in medical
domains and impede continuous updates and training with new data. Federated
Learning (FL), a privacy-preserving distributed training framework, offers a
new solution by enabling collaborative model development across fragmented
medical datasets. In this survey, we review FL's contributions at two stages of
the full-stack medical analysis pipeline. First, in upstream tasks such as CT
or MRI reconstruction, FL enables joint training of robust reconstruction
networks on diverse, multi-institutional datasets, alleviating data scarcity
while preserving confidentiality. Second, in downstream clinical tasks like
tumor diagnosis and segmentation, FL supports continuous model updating by
allowing local fine-tuning on new data without centralizing sensitive images.
We comprehensively analyze FL implementations across the medical imaging
pipeline, from physics-informed reconstruction networks to diagnostic AI
systems, highlighting innovations that improve communication efficiency, align
heterogeneous data, and ensure secure parameter aggregation. Meanwhile, this
paper provides an outlook on future research directions, aiming to serve as a
valuable reference for the field's development.

TL;DR: MAPTA is an autonomous system for security auditing of AI-generated code. It achieves strong vulnerability detection across various benchmarks, highlighting the scalability and cost efficiency of this approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The democratization of software development through AI-powered platforms has created a security auditing scalability crisis, as vulnerabilities appear faster than they can be assessed.

Method: MAPTA employs a multi-agent system combining large language model orchestration, tool-grounded execution, and exploit validation to autonomously assess web application security.

Result: MAPTA achieved a 76.9% success rate on a standardized benchmark for detecting vulnerabilities and demonstrated cost-efficiency, with a low median cost of $0.073 for successful challenges.

Conclusion: MAPTA proves scalable and cost-effective for autonomous security assessment of web applications. Its practical findings, including critical vulnerabilities, emphasize its real-world impact and efficiency.

Abstract: AI-powered development platforms are making software creation accessible to a
broader audience, but this democratization has triggered a scalability crisis
in security auditing. With studies showing that up to 40% of AI-generated code
contains vulnerabilities, the pace of development now vastly outstrips the
capacity for thorough security assessment.
  We present MAPTA, a multi-agent system for autonomous web application
security assessment that combines large language model orchestration with
tool-grounded execution and end-to-end exploit validation. On the 104-challenge
XBOW benchmark, MAPTA achieves 76.9% overall success with perfect performance
on SSRF and misconfiguration vulnerabilities, 83% success on broken
authorization, and strong results on injection attacks including server-side
template injection (85%) and SQL injection (83%). Cross-site scripting (57%)
and blind SQL injection (0%) remain challenging. Our comprehensive cost
analysis across all challenges totals $21.38 with a median cost of $0.073 for
successful attempts versus $0.357 for failures. Success correlates strongly
with resource efficiency, enabling practical early-stopping thresholds at
approximately 40 tool calls or $0.30 per challenge.
  MAPTA's real-world findings are impactful given both the popularity of the
respective scanned GitHub repositories (8K-70K stars) and MAPTA's low average
operating cost of $3.67 per open-source assessment: MAPTA discovered critical
vulnerabilities including RCEs, command injections, secret exposure, and
arbitrary file write vulnerabilities. Findings are responsibly disclosed, 10
findings are under CVE review.

*Junjie Chu,Mingjie Li,Ziqing Yang,Ye Leng,Chenhao Lin,Chao Shen,Michael Backes,Yun Shen,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces JADES, a framework for assessing jailbreak attempts on language models, achieving high alignment with human evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating jailbreak attempts yield inconsistent and subjective results, misaligned with human perception, necessitating improved evaluation approaches.

Method: JADES uses a decompositional scoring system that breaks down harmful questions into weighted sub-questions, scores their answers, aggregates them, and incorporates optional fact-checking for hallucinations.

Result: JADES achieves 98.5% agreement with human evaluators, significantly outperforming baselines, and reveals overestimation in attack success rates on LLMs.

Conclusion: JADES offers a reliable, universal evaluation framework for future jailbreak attempts with accurate, consistent, and interpretable results.

Abstract: Accurately determining whether a jailbreak attempt has succeeded is a
fundamental yet unresolved challenge. Existing evaluation methods rely on
misaligned proxy indicators or naive holistic judgments. They frequently
misinterpret model responses, leading to inconsistent and subjective
assessments that misalign with human perception. To address this gap, we
introduce JADES (Jailbreak Assessment via Decompositional Scoring), a universal
jailbreak evaluation framework. Its key mechanism is to automatically decompose
an input harmful question into a set of weighted sub-questions, score each
sub-answer, and weight-aggregate the sub-scores into a final decision. JADES
also incorporates an optional fact-checking module to strengthen the detection
of hallucinations in jailbreak responses. We validate JADES on JailbreakQR, a
newly introduced benchmark proposed in this work, consisting of 400 pairs of
jailbreak prompts and responses, each meticulously annotated by humans. In a
binary setting (success/failure), JADES achieves 98.5% agreement with human
evaluators, outperforming strong baselines by over 9%. Re-evaluating five
popular attacks on four LLMs reveals substantial overestimation (e.g., LAA's
attack success rate on GPT-3.5-Turbo drops from 93% to 69%). Our results show
that JADES could deliver accurate, consistent, and interpretable evaluations,
providing a reliable basis for measuring future jailbreak attacks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for creating realistic and category-specific vulnerability datasets by injecting vulnerabilities into secure codebases, leveraging AI agents and advanced techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to increasing software complexity and sophisticated cyber-attacks, there is a need for automated systems for vulnerability detection and repair. Traditional methods struggle with scalability and accuracy, and AI-driven methods depend heavily on quality datasets.

Method: The framework simulates expert reasoning using coordinated AI agents, combines functional agents, Retrieval-Augmented Generation for context, and Low-Rank approximation for efficient model fine-tuning.

Result: The framework was tested on 116 code samples across three benchmarks, achieving 89% to 95% success rates in function-level vulnerability injection, surpassing other techniques in dataset accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable, accurate solution to generate high-quality datasets, improving the foundation for AI-based vulnerability detection and repair systems.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems and the sophistication of
cyber-attacks have underscored the critical need for effective automated
vulnerability detection and repair systems. Traditional methods, such as static
program analysis, face significant challenges related to scalability,
adaptability, and high false-positive and false-negative rates. AI-driven
approaches, particularly those using machine learning and deep learning models,
show promise but are heavily reliant on the quality and quantity of training
data. This paper introduces a novel framework designed to automatically
introduce realistic, category-specific vulnerabilities into secure C/C++
codebases to generate datasets. The proposed approach coordinates multiple AI
agents that simulate expert reasoning, along with function agents and
traditional code analysis tools. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation
for contextual grounding and employs Low-Rank approximation of weights for
efficient model fine-tuning. Our experimental study on 116 code samples from
three different benchmarks suggests that our approach outperforms other
techniques with regard to dataset accuracy, achieving between 89\% and 95\%
success rates in injecting vulnerabilities at function level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finding and integrating relevant ecological datasets is hindered by fragmented metadata standards and varying platform structures.

Result: The tool successfully extracts metadata with accuracy, enables dataset linkage using embedding similarity and rule-based processing, and supports advanced queries for ecological data.

Conclusion: This LLM-powered tool simplifies finding and integrating ecological datasets, paving the way for ontology creation and network-based querying in research environments.

Abstract: Large, open datasets can accelerate ecological research, particularly by
enabling researchers to develop new insights by reusing datasets from multiple
sources. However, to find the most suitable datasets to combine and integrate,
researchers must navigate diverse ecological and environmental data provider
platforms with varying metadata availability and standards. To overcome this
obstacle, we have developed a large language model (LLM)-based metadata
harvester that flexibly extracts metadata from any dataset's landing page, and
converts these to a user-defined, unified format using existing metadata
standards. We validate that our tool is able to extract both structured and
unstructured metadata with equal accuracy, aided by our LLM post-processing
protocol. Furthermore, we utilise LLMs to identify links between datasets, both
by calculating embedding similarity and by unifying the formats of extracted
metadata to enable rule-based processing. Our tool, which flexibly links the
metadata of different datasets, can therefore be used for ontology creation or
graph-based queries, for example, to find relevant ecological and environmental
datasets in a virtual research environment.

### [335] [Leveraging Large Language Models for Generating Research Topic Ontologies: A Multi-Disciplinary Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20693)
*Tanay Aggarwal,Angelo Salatino,Francesco Osborne,Enrico Motta*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to identify relationships among research topics across biomedicine, physics, and engineering. Fine-tuning LLMs on PEM-Rel-8K (a novel dataset) significantly improves their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ontologies and taxonomies are vital for organizing scientific knowledge, but their creation and upkeep are costly, uneven, and infrequent.

Method: The study evaluated LLMs using zero-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and fine-tuning on PEM-Rel-8K, a dataset with 8,000 extracted relationships from established taxonomies. Cross-domain transferability was also tested by fine-tuning models in one domain and applying them in another.

Result: Fine-tuning LLMs on the newly introduced PEM-Rel-8K dataset resulted in excellent performance across biomedicine, physics, and engineering.

Conclusion: LLMs, when fine-tuned with dedicated datasets like PEM-Rel-8K, have significant potential for enhancing ontology creation and maintenance efficiently across diverse scientific disciplines.

Abstract: Ontologies and taxonomies of research fields are critical for managing and
organising scientific knowledge, as they facilitate efficient classification,
dissemination and retrieval of information. However, the creation and
maintenance of such ontologies are expensive and time-consuming tasks, usually
requiring the coordinated effort of multiple domain experts. Consequently,
ontologies in this space often exhibit uneven coverage across different
disciplines, limited inter-domain connectivity, and infrequent updating cycles.
In this study, we investigate the capability of several large language models
to identify semantic relationships among research topics within three academic
domains: biomedicine, physics, and engineering. The models were evaluated under
three distinct conditions: zero-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and
fine-tuning on existing ontologies. Additionally, we assessed the cross-domain
transferability of fine-tuned models by measuring their performance when
trained in one domain and subsequently applied to a different one. To support
this analysis, we introduce PEM-Rel-8K, a novel dataset consisting of over
8,000 relationships extracted from the most widely adopted taxonomies in the
three disciplines considered in this study: MeSH, PhySH, and IEEE. Our
experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on PEM-Rel-8K yields excellent
performance across all disciplines.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a data-efficient pipeline for point cloud segmentation, boosting segmentation accuracy and generalization using minimal labeled data from a target domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust and accurate point cloud segmentation in scenarios with scarce in-domain labeled data, particularly for unimproved roads and other categories.

Method: The authors developed a two-stage training framework involving pre-training on mixed data and fine-tuning on in-domain data. Novel regularizers like Point Prompt Training and Manifold Mixup were explored to enhance performance.

Result: Using only 50 labeled point clouds, their method improved mean Intersection-over-Union from 33.5% to 51.8% and overall accuracy from 85.5% to 90.8%, compared to naive training approaches.

Conclusion: Pre-training on multiple datasets significantly improves generalization and segmentation robustness under limited labeled data scenarios, providing a practical solution for 3D semantic segmentation in low-data environments.

Abstract: In this case study, we present a data-efficient point cloud segmentation
pipeline and training framework for robust segmentation of unimproved roads and
seven other classes. Our method employs a two-stage training framework: first,
a projection-based convolutional neural network is pre-trained on a mixture of
public urban datasets and a small, curated in-domain dataset; then, a
lightweight prediction head is fine-tuned exclusively on in-domain data. Along
the way, we explore the application of Point Prompt Training to batch
normalization layers and the effects of Manifold Mixup as a regularizer within
our pipeline. We also explore the effects of incorporating histogram-normalized
ambients to further boost performance. Using only 50 labeled point clouds from
our target domain, we show that our proposed training approach improves mean
Intersection-over-Union from 33.5% to 51.8% and the overall accuracy from 85.5%
to 90.8%, when compared to naive training on the in-domain data. Crucially, our
results demonstrate that pre-training across multiple datasets is key to
improving generalization and enabling robust segmentation under limited
in-domain supervision. Overall, this study demonstrates a practical framework
for robust 3D semantic segmentation in challenging, low-data scenarios. Our

including multiscale analysis, attention mechanisms, and the integration of
prior knowledge, across the encoder, bottleneck, skip connections, and decoder
components of segmentation networks. Our discussion is organized around seven
key dimensions: (1) the shift from supervised to semi-/unsupervised learning,
(2) the transition from organ segmentation to lesion-focused tasks, (3)
advances in multi-modality integration and domain adaptation, (4) the role of
foundation models and transfer learning, (5) the move from deterministic to
probabilistic segmentation, (6) the progression from 2D to 3D and 4D
segmentation, and (7) the trend from model invocation to segmentation agents.
Together, these perspectives provide a holistic overview of the trajectory of

*Yihan Zhou,Haocheng Huang,Yue Yu,Jianhui Shang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a CNN-based framework for precise pulmonary nodule volume estimation in CT scans, significantly reducing error and speed compared to current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional lung nodule assessment methods have inconsistent volume estimates due to shape and density variability, necessitating a more accurate and efficient solution.

Method: The paper employs a multi-scale 3D CNN with subtype-specific bias correction, trained on 364 CT cases, for volume estimation.

Result: The proposed approach achieved an 8.0% error rate, which is better than the 25-30% of existing methods, and processed each scan in under 20 seconds.

Conclusion: This framework offers a scalable, efficient, and accurate tool for lung cancer detection, promising significant clinical benefits in early detection and monitoring.

Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is crucial for effective treatment and relies
on accurate volumetric assessment of pulmonary nodules in CT scans. Traditional
methods, such as consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR) and spherical
approximation, are limited by inconsistent estimates due to variability in
nodule shape and density. We propose an advanced framework that combines a
multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) with subtype-specific bias
correction for precise volume estimation. The model was trained and evaluated
on a dataset of 364 cases from Shanghai Chest Hospital. Our approach achieved a
mean absolute deviation of 8.0 percent compared to manual nonlinear regression,
with inference times under 20 seconds per scan. This method outperforms
existing deep learning and semi-automated pipelines, which typically have
errors of 25 to 30 percent and require over 60 seconds for processing. Our
results show a reduction in error by over 17 percentage points and a threefold
acceleration in processing speed. These advancements offer a highly accurate,
efficient, and scalable tool for clinical lung nodule screening and monitoring,
with promising potential for improving early lung cancer detection.

*Jessica Kinnevan,Naifa Alqahtani,Toral Chauhan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the use of LiDAR technology in mobile devices for background removal, highlighting its independence from lighting conditions, and provides a real-time implementation on the iPhone 15 Pro Max.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a lighting-independent and efficient alternative for background removal, overcoming constraints of traditional methods like chroma keying and AI models.

Method: Integrated LiDAR and color camera data with GPU-based processing and implemented image enhancement using Apple development tools and Metal Shader Language on the iPhone 15 Pro Max.

Result: Achieved real-time background removal at 60 frames per second with a limitation of 320x240 resolution for depth maps, highlighting potential improvements if LiDAR resolution matches color image resolution.

Conclusion: LiDAR holds promise to become the leading method for background removal in consumer devices, contingent on resolution and material-specific depth accuracy improvements.

Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology in consumer-grade mobile
devices can be used as a replacement for traditional background removal and
compositing techniques. Unlike approaches such as chroma keying and trained AI
models, LiDAR's depth information is independent of subject lighting, and
performs equally well in low-light and well-lit environments. We integrate the
LiDAR and color cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro Max with GPU-based image
processing. We use Apple's SwiftUI and Swift frameworks for user interface and
backend development, and Metal Shader Language (MSL) for realtime image
enhancement at the standard iPhone streaming frame rate of 60 frames per
second. The only meaningful limitations of the technology are the streaming
bandwidth of the depth data, which currently reduces the depth map resolution
to 320x240, and any pre-existing limitations of the LiDAR IR laser to reflect
accurate depth from some materials. If the LiDAR resolution on a mobile device
like the iPhone can be improved to match the color image resolution, LiDAR
could feasibly become the preeminent method of background removal for video
applications and photography.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GENRE-CMR, a GAN-based framework for improving CMR image reconstruction, achieving superior results in terms of SSIM and PSNR across diverse data distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of balancing reduced scan time and maintaining image quality in CMR reconstruction motivates the development of a new methodology for generalization across diverse acquisition settings.

Method: GENRE-CMR uses a GAN-based architecture with a residual deep unrolled framework, incorporating iterative optimization cascades and two specialized loss functions: Edge-Aware Region (EAR) loss and Statistical Distribution Alignment (SDA) loss.

Result: GENRE-CMR demonstrated better performance than current state-of-the-art techniques, achieving 0.9552 SSIM and 38.90 dB PSNR on unseen data distributions, validated through extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a robust and adaptable solution for high-quality CMR image reconstruction, supporting clinical applications across heterogeneous acquisition protocols.

Abstract: Accelerated Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) image reconstruction
remains a critical challenge due to the trade-off between scan time and image
quality, particularly when generalizing across diverse acquisition settings. We
propose GENRE-CMR, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based architecture
employing a residual deep unrolled reconstruction framework to enhance
reconstruction fidelity and generalization. The architecture unrolls iterative
optimization into a cascade of convolutional subnetworks, enriched with
residual connections to enable progressive feature propagation from shallow to
deeper stages. To further improve performance, we integrate two loss functions:
(1) an Edge-Aware Region (EAR) loss, which guides the network to focus on
structurally informative regions and helps prevent common reconstruction
blurriness; and (2) a Statistical Distribution Alignment (SDA) loss, which
regularizes the feature space across diverse data distributions via a symmetric
KL divergence formulation. Extensive experiments confirm that GENRE-CMR
surpasses state-of-the-art methods on training and unseen data, achieving
0.9552 SSIM and 38.90 dB PSNR on unseen distributions across various
acceleration factors and sampling trajectories. Ablation studies confirm the
contribution of each proposed component to reconstruction quality and
generalization. Our framework presents a unified and robust solution for
high-quality CMR reconstruction, paving the way for clinically adaptable
deployment across heterogeneous acquisition protocols.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the performance of DINOv3-H+ vision transformer for classifying atypical mitotic figures using parameter-efficient fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately detecting atypical mitotic figures is challenging due to low prevalence, subtle morphology, and variability in human interpretation, and addressing these challenges is critical because AMFs are markers of poor prognosis.

Method: The authors utilized the DINOv3-H+ vision transformer pretrained on natural images and fine-tuned it with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and extensive data augmentation for application in histopathology.

Result: The DINOv3 model achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.8871 on the preliminary test set, showing its effectiveness despite the domain gap.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the robustness of DINOv3 pretraining, indicating that it can serve as a strong and efficient baseline for classifying atypical mitotic figures in MIDOG 2025.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are markers of abnormal cell division
associated with poor prognosis, yet their detection remains difficult due to
low prevalence, subtle morphology, and inter-observer variability. The MIDOG
2025 challenge introduces a benchmark for AMF classification across multiple
domains. In this work, we evaluate the recently published DINOv3-H+ vision
transformer, pretrained on natural images, which we fine-tuned using low-rank
adaptation (LoRA, 650k trainable parameters) and extensive augmentation.
Despite the domain gap, DINOv3 transfers effectively to histopathology,
achieving a balanced accuracy of 0.8871 on the preliminary test set. These
results highlight the robustness of DINOv3 pretraining and show that, when
combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, it provides a strong baseline
for atypical mitosis classification in MIDOG 2025.

*Yoshiaki Horiike,Shin Fujishiro*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The paper studies human brain computation, showing functional tasks alter subtle antisymmetric brain region interactions, enabling energy-efficient computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how the human brain achieves diverse functional computations without significantly increasing energy consumption.

Method: Analyzed spontaneous and task-induced whole-cerebral-cortex activity to identify state transition patterns using probability fluxes and modeled interactions using asymmetric Ising spin systems.

Result: Task-specific antisymmetric brain region interactions were identified as subtle yet key in reproducing observed state transition flux patterns.

Conclusion: Functional brain computation is achieved through small energy adjustments via antisymmetric brain-region interaction modifications.

Abstract: The functional computation of the human brain arises from the collective
behaviour of the underlying neural network. The emerging technology enables the
recording of population activity in neurons, and the theory of neural networks
is expected to explain and extract functional computations from the data.
Thermodynamically, a large proportion of the whole-body energy is consumed by
the brain, and functional computation of the human brain seems to involve high
energy consumption. The human brain, however, does not increase its energy
consumption with its function, and most of its energy consumption is not
involved in specific brain function: how can the human brain perform its wide
repertoire of functional computations without drastically changing its energy
consumption? Here, we present a mechanism to perform functional computation by
subtle modification of the interaction network among the brain regions. We
first show that, by analyzing the data of spontaneous and task-induced
whole-cerebral-cortex activity, the probability fluxes, which are the
microscopic irreversible measure of state transitions, exhibit unique patterns
depending on the task being performed, indicating that the human brain function
is a distinct sequence of the brain state transitions. We then fit the
parameters of Ising spin systems with asymmetric interactions, where we reveal
that the symmetric interactions among the brain regions are strong and
task-independent, but the antisymmetric interactions are subtle and
task-dependent, and the inferred model reproduces most of the observed
probability flux patterns. Our results indicate that the human brain performs
its functional computation by subtly modifying the antisymmetric interaction
among the brain regions, which might be possible with a small amount of energy.

Motivation: The motivation behind the research is to handle the challenge posed by petabyte-scale data volumes generated in modern astronomy and astrophysics, which require advanced tools for efficient storage, access, and analysis.

Method: The paper discusses the use of VisIVO software, leveraging containerization, virtualization, distributed computing infrastructures like EOSC, and collaborations with projects such as SPACE Center of Excellence and the H2020 EUPEX Project.

Result: The advancement of VisIVO aims to make it portable, maintainable, and capable of exploiting heterogeneous HPC infrastructures effectively while addressing data-movement overheads and I/O performance limitations.

Conclusion: The outlined evolution of VisIVO supports high-performance visualization and analysis of massive astrophysical datasets, paving the way for its broader use in next-generation computing systems in astronomy and cosmology.

Abstract: Petabyte-scale data volumes are generated by observations and simulations in
modern astronomy and astrophysics. Storage, access, and data analysis are
significantly hampered by such data volumes and are leading to the development
of a new generation of software tools. The Visualization Interface for the
Virtual Observatory (VisIVO) has been designed, developed and maintained by
INAF since 2005 to perform multi-dimensional data analysis and knowledge
discovery in multivariate astrophysical datasets. Utilizing containerization
and virtualization technologies, VisIVO has already been used to exploit
distributed computing infrastructures including the European Open Science Cloud
(EOSC).
  We intend to adapt VisIVO solutions for high performance visualization of
data generated on the (pre-)Exascale systems by HPC applications in
Astrophysics and Cosmology (A\&C), including GADGET (GAlaxies with Dark matter
and Gas) and PLUTO simulations, thanks to the collaboration within the SPACE
Center of Excellence, the H2020 EUPEX Project, and the ICSC National Research
Centre. In this work, we outline the evolution's course as well as the
execution strategies designed to achieve the following goals: enhance the
portability of the VisIVO modular applications and their resource requirements;
foster reproducibility and maintainability; take advantage of a more flexible
resource exploitation over heterogeneous HPC facilities; and, finally, minimize
data-movement overheads and improve I/O performances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the regulatory issues and compliance challenges in integrating deep learning-based automated visual inspection systems for high-risk medical devices.

Method: The paper provides a high-level technical assessment identifying challenges related to risk management, datasets, model validation, explainability, and monitoring regulations.

Result: Potential implementation strategies were proposed, gaps in compliance requirements (like statistical significance and data retention) were identified, and global regulatory implications highlighted.

Conclusion: Although deep learning shows promise in enhancing medical device inspections, manufacturers face significant compliance hurdles under the EU AI Act, requiring additional preparation and regulatory consultation.

Abstract: As deep learning (DL) technologies advance, their application in automated
visual inspection for Class III medical devices offers significant potential to
enhance quality assurance and reduce human error. However, the adoption of such
AI-based systems introduces new regulatory complexities--particularly under the
EU Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act, which imposes high-risk system obligations
that differ in scope and depth from established regulatory frameworks such as
the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and the U.S. FDA Quality System Regulation
(QSR). This paper presents a high-level technical assessment of the
foresee-able challenges that manufacturers are likely to encounter when
qualifying DL-based automated inspections within the existing medical device
compliance landscape. It examines divergences in risk management principles,
dataset governance, model validation, explainability requirements, and
post-deployment monitoring obligations. The discussion also explores potential
implementation strategies and highlights areas of uncertainty, including data
retention burdens, global compliance implications, and the practical
difficulties of achieving statistical significance in validation with limited
defect data. Disclaimer: This publication is in-tended solely as an academic

TL;DR: The paper examines challenges and implications in recruitment methodologies for involving stakeholders in Participatory AI projects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of engaging diverse stakeholder groups in AI systems, ensuring equity and reflecting their values.

Method: Analyzing a corpus of 37 AI projects and conducting interviews with five researchers to study recruitment methodologies and outcomes.

Result: Recruitment outcomes are affected by structural work conditions, researchers' expectations, and relationships formed during collaborations.

Conclusion: Recommendations are provided to improve relationship-focused recruitment methods and encourage reflective documentation practices for AI researchers.

Abstract: Participatory AI, in which impacted community members and other stakeholders
are involved in the design and development of AI systems, holds promise as a
way to ensure AI is developed to meet their needs and reflect their values.
However, the process of identifying, reaching out, and engaging with all
relevant stakeholder groups, which we refer to as recruitment methodology, is
still a practical challenge in AI projects striving to adopt participatory
practices. In this paper, we investigate the challenges that researchers face
when designing and executing recruitment methodology for Participatory AI
projects, and the implications of current recruitment practice for
Participatory AI. First, we describe the recruitment methodologies used in AI
projects using a corpus of 37 projects to capture the diversity of practices in
the field and perform an initial analysis on the documentation of recruitment
practices, as well as specific strategies that researchers use to meet goals of
equity and empowerment. To complement this analysis, we interview five AI
researchers to learn about the outcomes of recruitment methodologies. We find
that these outcomes are shaped by structural conditions of their work,

### [348] [Validating Generative Agent-Based Models for Logistics and Supply Chain Management Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20234)
*Vincent E. Castillo*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Generative Agent-Based Models (GABMs) using large language models (LLMs) show promise for logistics and supply chain management simulations but require validation due to differences in human-like behavior modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether large language models can accurately simulate human behavior for logistics and supply chain management research.

Method: Evaluated human-equivalence and decision process validation of six state-of-the-art large language models compared to 957 human participants in food delivery scenarios through a controlled experiment.

Result: LLMs showed surface-level equivalence to human behavior but revealed artificial decision-making processes not reflective of human behavior.

Conclusion: GABMs can be effective for logistics simulation with the implementation of rigorous validation checks, and the dual-validation framework enhances development and application in LSCM.

Abstract: Generative Agent-Based Models (GABMs) powered by large language models (LLMs)
offer promising potential for empirical logistics and supply chain management
(LSCM) research by enabling realistic simulation of complex human behaviors.
Unlike traditional agent-based models, GABMs generate human-like responses
through natural language reasoning, which creates potential for new
perspectives on emergent LSCM phenomena. However, the validity of LLMs as
proxies for human behavior in LSCM simulations is unknown. This study evaluates
LLM equivalence of human behavior through a controlled experiment examining
dyadic customer-worker engagements in food delivery scenarios. I test six
state-of-the-art LLMs against 957 human participants (477 dyads) using a
moderated mediation design. This study reveals a need to validate GABMs on two
levels: (1) human equivalence testing, and (2) decision process validation.
Results reveal GABMs can effectively simulate human behaviors in LSCM; however,
an equivalence-versus-process paradox emerges. While a series of Two One-Sided
Tests (TOST) for equivalence reveals some LLMs demonstrate surface-level
equivalence to humans, structural equation modeling (SEM) reveals artificial
decision processes not present in human participants for some LLMs. These
findings show GABMs as a potentially viable methodological instrument in LSCM
with proper validation checks. The dual-validation framework also provides LSCM
researchers with a guide to rigorous GABM development. For practitioners, this
study offers evidence-based assessment for LLM selection for operational tasks.

### [349] [ELIXIR: Efficient and LIghtweight model for eXplaIning Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20312)
*Ben Kabongo,Vincent Guigue,Pirmin Lemberger*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces ELIXIR, a lightweight model based on T5-small, for personalized recommendation explanations, outperforming larger models in review generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While collaborative filtering excels in recommender systems, it struggles with providing transparent and fine-grained explanations for user-item interactions. Generating personalized textual explanations is increasingly needed.

Method: ELIXIR is a multi-task model combining rating prediction and review generation. It learns global/aspect-specific representations, optimizes ratings, and generates reviews with personalized attention based on a T5-small architecture.

Result: ELIXIR achieves superior performance compared to baseline models, particularly in personalized review generation, as demonstrated on datasets like TripAdvisor and RateBeer.

Conclusion: By jointly predicting ratings and guiding review generation with aspect modeling, ELIXIR efficiently improves explainability and personalization in recommendations, even with a smaller model.

Abstract: Collaborative filtering drives many successful recommender systems but
struggles with fine-grained user-item interactions and explainability. As users
increasingly seek transparent recommendations, generating textual explanations
through language models has become a critical research area. Existing methods
employ either RNNs or Transformers. However, RNN-based approaches fail to
leverage the capabilities of pre-trained Transformer models, whereas
Transformer-based methods often suffer from suboptimal adaptation and neglect
aspect modeling, which is crucial for personalized explanations. We propose
ELIXIR (Efficient and LIghtweight model for eXplaIning Recommendations), a
multi-task model combining rating prediction with personalized review
generation. ELIXIR jointly learns global and aspect-specific representations of
users and items, optimizing overall rating, aspect-level ratings, and review
generation, with personalized attention to emphasize aspect importance. Based
on a T5-small (60M) model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our aspect-based
architecture in guiding text generation in a personalized context, where
state-of-the-art approaches exploit much larger models but fail to match user
preferences as well. Experimental results on TripAdvisor and RateBeer
demonstrate that ELIXIR significantly outperforms strong baseline models,
especially in review generation.

### [350] [MPFormer: Adaptive Framework for Industrial Multi-Task Personalized Sequential Retriever](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20400)
*Yijia Sun,Shanshan Huang,Linxiao Che,Haitao Lu,Qiang Luo,Kun Gai,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MPFormer, a dynamic multi-task Transformer framework, to address the misalignment between multi-stage optimization in industrial recommendation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern recommendation systems face challenges with semantic alignment between multi-objective ranking and single-objective retrieval phases.

Method: It proposes three innovative mechanisms: objective-conditioned Transformer for encoding, dynamic adjustment via personalized target weights, and incorporation of user personalization into token representations.

Result: MPFormer was integrated into Kuaishou's recommendation system, serving 400 million daily users, improving user engagement and system efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework optimizes multi-objective retrieval while maintaining speed, offering scalable solutions for recommendation systems in the industry.

Abstract: Modern industrial recommendation systems encounter a core challenge of
multi-stage optimization misalignment: a significant semantic gap exists
between the multi-objective optimization paradigm widely used in the ranking
phase and the single-objective modeling in the retrieve phase. Although the
mainstream industry solution achieves multi-objective coverage through parallel
multi-path single-objective retrieval, this approach leads to linear growth of
training and serving resources with the number of objectives and has inherent
limitations in handling loosely coupled objectives. This paper proposes the
MPFormer, a dynamic multi-task Transformer framework, which systematically
addresses the aforementioned issues through three innovative mechanisms. First,
an objective-conditioned transformer that jointly encodes user behavior
sequences and multi-task semantics through learnable attention modulation;
second, personalized target weights are introduced to achieve dynamic
adjustment of retrieval results; finally, user personalization information is
incorporated into token representations and the Transformer structure to
further enhance the model's representation ability. This framework has been
successfully integrated into Kuaishou short video recommendation system, stably
serving over 400 million daily active users. It significantly improves user
daily engagement and system operational efficiency. Practical deployment
verification shows that, compared with traditional solutions, it effectively
optimizes the iterative paradigm of multi-objective retrieval while maintaining
service response speed, providing a scalable multi-objective solution for
industrial recommendation systems.

### [351] [Rethinking Purity and Diversity in Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation from the Frequency Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20427)
*Yongqiang Han,Kai Cheng,Kefan Wang,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces PDB4Rec, a model for multi-behavior sequential recommendation (MBSR) that utilizes both low- and high-frequency user behavior data for better predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In MBSR, multiple user behaviors like browsing and clicking are integrated, but some behavior data introduces noise. Prior studies focus on denoising high-frequency data, assuming it to be noisy, while emphasizing low-frequency data as valuable.

Method: The authors argue that high-frequency data is important for capturing user interest diversity. They propose PDB4Rec, a model that extracts and balances information from various frequency bands using a Bootstrapping Balancer mechanism.

Result: PDB4Rec outperforms existing methods in experiments conducted on real-world datasets, showcasing its effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The study concludes that both high- and low-frequency information are crucial for MBSR, and their balanced integration enhances recommendation system performance.

Abstract: In recommendation systems, users often exhibit multiple behaviors, such as
browsing, clicking, and purchasing. Multi-behavior sequential recommendation
(MBSR) aims to consider these different behaviors in an integrated manner to
improve the recommendation performance of the target behavior. However, some
behavior data will also bring inevitable noise to the modeling of user
interests. Some research efforts focus on data denoising from the frequency
domain perspective to improve the accuracy of user preference prediction. These
studies indicate that low-frequency information tends to be valuable and
reliable, while high-frequency information is often associated with noise. In
this paper, we argue that high-frequency information is by no means
insignificant. Further experimental results highlight that low frequency
corresponds to the purity of user interests, while high frequency corresponds
to the diversity of user interests. Building upon this finding, we proposed our
model PDB4Rec, which efficiently extracts information across various frequency
bands and their relationships, and introduces Boostrapping Balancer mechanism
to balance their contributions for improved recommendation performance.
Sufficient experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our model.

### [352] [On the Theoretical Limitations of Embedding-Based Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21038)
*Orion Weller,Michael Boratko,Iftekhar Naim,Jinhyuk Lee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the theoretical and practical limitations of vector embeddings when handling simple queries under the single vector paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vector embeddings face increasingly complex retrieval tasks, and their limitations need to be understood, especially as they are applied to diverse tasks such as reasoning and coding.

Method: The authors connect learning theory to the practical performance of embeddings, analyzing the relationship between embedding dimensions and top-k subset retrieval. They create a LIMIT dataset to empirically test these models.

Result: The study shows that even state-of-the-art embedding models fail on LIMIT, a dataset stressing simple query tasks, due to fundamental limitations tied to embedding dimensions.

Conclusion: The research highlights the inadequacies of the current single vector paradigm for embeddings, urging future work to address these intrinsic constraints.

Abstract: Vector embeddings have been tasked with an ever-increasing set of retrieval
tasks over the years, with a nascent rise in using them for reasoning,
instruction-following, coding, and more. These new benchmarks push embeddings
to work for any query and any notion of relevance that could be given. While
prior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings,
there is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to
unrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better
training data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may
encounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely
simple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the
number of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of
some query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show
that this holds true even if we restrict to k=2, and directly optimize on the
test set with free parameterized embeddings. We then create a realistic dataset
called LIMIT that stress tests models based on these theoretical results, and
observe that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the
simple nature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under
the existing single vector paradigm and calls for future research to develop
methods that can resolve this fundamental limitation.

### [353] [Revealing Potential Biases in LLM-Based Recommender Systems in the Cold Start Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20401)
*Alexandre Andre,Gauthier Roy,Eva Dyer,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates fairness in cold-start recommendations by LLMs using a benchmark designed to uncover biases like gender and cultural stereotypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from concerns about societal biases encoded in LLMs during pretraining that may affect fairness in zero-context recommendation tasks.

Method: A modular pipeline was designed to benchmark fairness in zero-context recommendation settings, incorporating configurable domains and sensitive attributes for flexible audits.

Result: Evaluations uncovered consistent biases in top models across music, movies, and colleges domains, highlighting gendered and cultural stereotypes. A non-linear relationship between model size and fairness was also identified.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the necessity for systematic evaluation of fairness and nuanced analyses of LLM behavior in cold-start scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for recommendation tasks
due to their general-purpose capabilities. While LLMs perform well in
rich-context settings, their behavior in cold-start scenarios, where only
limited signals such as age, gender, or language are available, raises fairness
concerns because they may rely on societal biases encoded during pretraining.
We introduce a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate fairness in
zero-context recommendation. Our modular pipeline supports configurable
recommendation domains and sensitive attributes, enabling systematic and
flexible audits of any open-source LLM. Through evaluations of state-of-the-art
models (Gemma 3 and Llama 3.2), we uncover consistent biases across
recommendation domains (music, movies, and colleges) including gendered and
cultural stereotypes. We also reveal a non-linear relationship between model
size and fairness, highlighting the need for nuanced analysis.

### [354] [SemSR: Semantics aware robust Session-based Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20587)
*Jyoti Narwariya,Priyanka Gupta,Muskan Gupta,Jyotsana Khatri,Lovekesh Vig*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in session-based recommendation systems, proposing various integration methods to enhance predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Session-based recommendation models often lack semantic context, which limits understanding user intent and interpretability. Existing LLM methodologies either lack fine-tuned feedback or are computationally expensive to maintain.

Method: The paper introduces three approaches for using LLMs in SR: (1) in-context LLM recommendations, (2) LLM-generated semantic representations, and (3) LLM integration with traditional data-driven SR models. The methods are tested on two real-world datasets.

Result: LLM-based methods excel in high-recall retrieval tasks, while traditional approaches provide better fine-grained ranking. Integrated LLM-data-driven models outperform standalone and baseline models in both Recall and MRR metrics.

Conclusion: Combining LLMs with traditional data-driven techniques offers a promising direction for improving the effectiveness and accuracy of session-based recommendation systems.

Abstract: Session-based recommendation (SR) models aim to recommend items to anonymous
users based on their behavior during the current session. While various SR
models in the literature utilize item sequences to predict the next item, they
often fail to leverage semantic information from item titles or descriptions
impeding session intent identification and interpretability. Recent research
has explored Large Language Models (LLMs) as promising approaches to enhance
session-based recommendations, with both prompt-based and fine-tuning based
methods being widely investigated. However, prompt-based methods struggle to
identify optimal prompts that elicit correct reasoning and lack task-specific
feedback at test time, resulting in sub-optimal recommendations. Fine-tuning
methods incorporate domain-specific knowledge but incur significant
computational costs for implementation and maintenance. In this paper, we
present multiple approaches to utilize LLMs for session-based recommendation:
(i) in-context LLMs as recommendation agents, (ii) LLM-generated
representations for semantic initialization of deep learning SR models, and
(iii) integration of LLMs with data-driven SR models. Through comprehensive
experiments on two real-world publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that
LLM-based methods excel at coarse-level retrieval (high recall values), while
traditional data-driven techniques perform well at fine-grained ranking (high
Mean Reciprocal Rank values). Furthermore, the integration of LLMs with
data-driven SR models significantly out performs both standalone LLM approaches
and data-driven deep learning models, as well as baseline SR models, in terms
of both Recall and MRR metrics.

*Xinhao Huang,Zhibo Ren,Yipeng Yu,Ying Zhou,Zulong Chen,Zeyi Wen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel contrastive learning framework, SEAL, and a structured document retrieval dataset to enhance retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for long structured document retrieval fail to utilize structural and semantic features effectively due to lack of structural metadata.

Method: The paper proposes SEAL, using structure-aware learning for semantic hierarchies and masked element alignment, accompanied by the release of a rich-annotated dataset.

Result: SEAL demonstrates consistent improvements across pre-trained models, including an NDCG@10 increase from 73.96% to 77.84% on BGE-M3, backed by A/B tests.

Conclusion: SEAL effectively addresses retrieval challenges by blending structural insights and fine-grained semantics, establishing its value through empirical validations.

Abstract: In long structured document retrieval, existing methods typically fine-tune
pre-trained language models (PLMs) using contrastive learning on datasets
lacking explicit structural information. This practice suffers from two
critical issues: 1) current methods fail to leverage structural features and
element-level semantics effectively, and 2) the lack of datasets containing
structural metadata. To bridge these gaps, we propose \our, a novel contrastive
learning framework. It leverages structure-aware learning to preserve semantic
hierarchies and masked element alignment for fine-grained semantic
discrimination. Furthermore, we release \dataset, a long structured document
retrieval dataset with rich structural annotations. Extensive experiments on
both released and industrial datasets across various modern PLMs, along with
online A/B testing, demonstrate consistent performance improvements, boosting
NDCG@10 from 73.96\% to 77.84\% on BGE-M3. The resources are available at

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The authors propose a novel approach to tackle computational inefficiencies in multi-domain autoregressive recommendation models by replacing full inter-domain attention with innovative mechanisms like Transition-Aware Positional Embeddings (TAPE) and Dynamic Domain State Representation (DDSR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive recommendation models, while successful, face computational challenges in multi-domain scenarios due to the transformer architecture's attention maps attending to all items across every domain.

Method: The paper introduces TAPE for domain-transition specific positional embeddings to focus attention only on intra-domain items and DDSR for dynamic state representation of domains to transfer relevant domain information without relying on full attention maps.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval tasks by effectively balancing inter- and intra-domain representations computationally.

Conclusion: The novel mechanisms TAPE and DDSR provide a scalable and efficient solution to the computational bottlenecks faced by multi-domain recommendation systems, enhancing their efficacy in large-scale scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive recommendation models (ARMs), such as Meta's HSTU
model, have emerged as a major breakthrough over traditional Deep Learning
Recommendation Models (DLRMs), exhibiting the highly sought-after scaling law
behaviour. However, when applied to multi-domain scenarios, the transformer
architecture's attention maps become a computational bottleneck, as they attend
to all items across every domain. To tackle this challenge, systems must
efficiently balance inter and intra-domain knowledge transfer. In this work, we
introduce a novel approach for scalable multi-domain recommendation systems by
replacing full inter-domain attention with two innovative mechanisms: 1)
Transition-Aware Positional Embeddings (TAPE): We propose novel positional
embeddings that account for domain-transition specific information. This allows
attention to be focused solely on intra-domain items, effectively reducing the
unnecessary computational cost associated with attending to irrelevant domains.
2) Dynamic Domain State Representation (DDSR): We introduce a dynamic state
representation for each domain, which is stored and accessed during subsequent
token predictions. This enables the efficient transfer of relevant domain
information without relying on full attention maps. Our method offers a
scalable solution to the challenges posed by large-scale, multi-domain
recommendation systems and demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval
tasks by separately modelling and combining inter- and intra-domain
representations.

*Lianpeng Qiao,Ziqi Cao,Kaiyu Feng,Ye Yuan,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReCoGNN, an AutoML framework for automating feature augmentation using relational tables. It combines intra-table semantic analysis, heterogeneous graph construction, and graph neural networks to improve predictive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of automating feature augmentation in predictive modeling by identifying and leveraging relational signals in datasets.

Method: ReCoGNN segments tables semantically, builds a heterogeneous weighted graph of inter-row relationships, and employs message-passing graph neural networks to refine features.

Result: Experiments on ten datasets show ReCoGNN consistently outperformed existing methods in classification and regression.

Conclusion: ReCoGNN provides an efficient and effective solution for automated feature augmentation, advancing predictive modeling with relational table data.

Abstract: Data has become a foundational asset driving innovation across domains such
as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In these areas, predictive modeling
over relational tables is commonly employed, with increasing emphasis on
reducing manual effort through automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques.
This raises an interesting question: can feature augmentation itself be
automated and identify and utilize task-related relational signals?
  To address this challenge, we propose an end-to-end automated feature
augmentation framework, ReCoGNN, which enhances initial datasets using features
extracted from multiple relational tables to support predictive tasks. ReCoGNN
first captures semantic dependencies within each table by modeling intra-table
attribute relationships, enabling it to partition tables into structured,
semantically coherent segments. It then constructs a heterogeneous weighted
graph that represents inter-row relationships across all segments. Finally,
ReCoGNN leverages message-passing graph neural networks to propagate
information through the graph, guiding feature selection and augmenting the
original dataset. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-life and
synthetic datasets demonstrate that ReCoGNN consistently outperforms existing
methods on both classification and regression tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in current open-source systems dealing with SQL-invoked LLM queries to improve their functionality and performance.

Method: The authors evaluated two open-source systems and one enterprise platform using five representative queries to identify main issues and implemented initial solutions to address structured outputs, resource optimization, and query planning.

Result: Initial solutions resulted in improvements in integrating LLMs with DBMS, showing potential for scalable and efficient processing of LLM queries.

Conclusion: Tighter integration between LLMs and database management systems (DBMS) is essential for enhanced scalability, efficiency, and functionality of SQL-invoked LLM queries.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential for applications such as
text summarization, sentiment analysis, and automated question-answering.
Recently, LLMs have also been integrated into relational database management
systems to enhance querying and support advanced data processing. Companies
such as Amazon, Databricks, Google, and Snowflake offer LLM invocation directly
within SQL, denoted as LLM queries, to boost data insights. However,
open-source solutions currently have limited functionality and poor
performance. In this work, we present an early exploration of two open-source
systems and one enterprise platform, using five representative queries to
expose functional, performance, and scalability limits in today's SQL-invoked
LLM integrations. We identify three main issues: enforcing structured outputs,
optimizing resource utilization, and improving query planning. We implemented
initial solutions and observed improvements in accommodating LLM powered SQL
queries. These early gains demonstrate that tighter integration of LLM+DBMS is
the key to scalable and efficient processing of LLM queries.

*Zizhao Tang,Changhao Liu,Nuo Tong,Shuiping Gou,Mei Shi*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This study proposed a deep learning-based multimodal approach combining CT images, radiomics, and clinical data to predict metastasis risk in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, demonstrating improved predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The clinical management of HNSCC faces challenges due to high metastatic risk, which necessitates reliable pre-treatment risk assessment to inform personalized treatment strategies.

Method: The framework integrates features from pretreatment CT images (via 3D Swin Transformer) with radiomics and encoded clinical data, using a fully connected network for multimodal fusion and risk prediction. Model performance was validated through five-fold cross-validation.

Result: The multimodal fusion model achieved an AUC of 0.803, outperforming single-modality models and demonstrating robust generalization across tumor subtypes. Ablation studies showed complementarities among modalities for enhanced representation.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal model offers high accuracy and interpretability for predicting metastasis risk in HNSCC, enabling personalized treatment planning and clinical decision support.

Abstract: Metastasis remains the major challenge in the clinical management of head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Reliable pre-treatment prediction of
metastatic risk is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and prognosis.
This study develops a deep learning-based multimodal framework to predict
metastasis risk in HNSCC patients by integrating computed tomography (CT)
images, radiomics, and clinical data. 1497 HNSCC patients were included. Tumor
and organ masks were derived from pretreatment CT images. A 3D Swin Transformer
extracted deep features from tumor regions. Meanwhile, 1562 radiomics features
were obtained using PyRadiomics, followed by correlation filtering and random
forest selection, leaving 36 features. Clinical variables including age, sex,
smoking, and alcohol status were encoded and fused with imaging-derived
features. Multimodal features were fed into a fully connected network to
predict metastasis risk. Performance was evaluated using five-fold
cross-validation with area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity
(SEN), and specificity (SPE). The proposed fusion model outperformed
single-modality models. The 3D deep learning module alone achieved an AUC of
0.715, and when combined with radiomics and clinical features, predictive
performance improved (AUC = 0.803, ACC = 0.752, SEN = 0.730, SPE = 0.758).
Stratified analysis showed generalizability across tumor subtypes. Ablation
studies indicated complementary information from different modalities.
Evaluation showed the 3D Swin Transformer provided more robust representation
learning than conventional networks. This multimodal fusion model demonstrated
high accuracy and robustness in predicting metastasis risk in HNSCC, offering a
comprehensive representation of tumor biology. The interpretable model has
potential as a clinical decision-support tool for personalized treatment
planning.

### [362] [Deep Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Asset Allocation Using DDPG with TiDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20103)
*Rongwei Liu,Jin Zheng,John Cartlidge*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of reinforcement learning for optimal asset allocation, leveraging a novel framework called DDPG-TiDE, which outperforms traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of traditional asset allocation methods that rely on rigid assumptions and static strategies.

Method: Formulate asset allocation as a Markov Decision Process, integrate TiDE into a DDPG framework, and compare performance with Q-learning and buy-and-hold strategies.

Result: Experimental findings show DDPG-TiDE yields higher risk-adjusted returns compared to Q-learning and buy-and-hold strategies.

Conclusion: Integrating TiDE into DDPG for dynamic asset allocation is effective and offers potential for future research.

Abstract: The optimal asset allocation between risky and risk-free assets is a
persistent challenge due to the inherent volatility in financial markets.
Conventional methods rely on strict distributional assumptions or non-additive
reward ratios, which limit their robustness and applicability to investment
goals. To overcome these constraints, this study formulates the optimal
two-asset allocation problem as a sequential decision-making task within a
Markov Decision Process (MDP). This framework enables the application of
reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms to develop dynamic policies based on
simulated financial scenarios, regardless of prerequisites. We use the Kelly
criterion to balance immediate reward signals against long-term investment
objectives, and we take the novel step of integrating the Time-series Dense
Encoder (TiDE) into the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) RL framework
for continuous decision-making. We compare DDPG-TiDE with a simple
discrete-action Q-learning RL framework and a passive buy-and-hold investment
strategy. Empirical results show that DDPG-TiDE outperforms Q-learning and
generates higher risk adjusted returns than buy-and-hold. These findings
suggest that tackling the optimal asset allocation problem by integrating TiDE
within a DDPG reinforcement learning framework is a fruitful avenue for further
exploration.

Result: Experiments show QTMRL outperforms 9 baseline trading models in profitability, risk-adjusted returns, and controlling downside risk across varying market conditions.

Conclusion: QTMRL demonstrates adaptability and stability, making it a strong candidate for portfolio management in dynamic financial markets. The code is publicly available for further research and validation.

Abstract: In the highly volatile and uncertain global financial markets, traditional
quantitative trading models relying on statistical modeling or empirical rules
often fail to adapt to dynamic market changes and black swan events due to
rigid assumptions and limited generalization. To address these issues, this
paper proposes QTMRL (Quantitative Trading Multi-Indicator Reinforcement
Learning), an intelligent trading agent combining multi-dimensional technical
indicators with reinforcement learning (RL) for adaptive and stable portfolio
management. We first construct a comprehensive multi-indicator dataset using 23
years of S&P 500 daily OHLCV data (2000-2022) for 16 representative stocks
across 5 sectors, enriching raw data with trend, volatility, and momentum
indicators to capture holistic market dynamics. Then we design a lightweight RL
framework based on the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm, including data
processing, A2C algorithm, and trading agent modules to support policy learning
and actionable trading decisions. Extensive experiments compare QTMRL with 9
baselines (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, moving average strategies) across diverse market
regimes, verifying its superiority in profitability, risk adjustment, and
downside risk control. The code of QTMRL is publicly available at

### [364] [Photonic restricted Boltzmann machine for content generation tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20472)
*Li Luo,Yisheng Fang,Wanyi Zhang,Zhichao Ruan*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper introduces the photonic restricted Boltzmann machine (PRBM), which uses photonic computing to enhance the speed of Gibbs sampling, enabling efficient content generation. This approach reduces computational costs and provides scalability for large-scale applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research seeks to address the computational limitations imposed by the high cost of Gibbs sampling in traditional restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), particularly for large-scale content generation tasks.

Method: PRBM leverages photonic computing, introduces an efficient encoding method to simplify computations, and employs a non-Von Neumann architecture to bypass storage-intensive requirements. This reduces the computational complexity of Gibbs sampling from O(N) to O(1).

Result: The PRBM was experimentally validated by simulating a two-dimensional Ising model, achieving phase transition results consistent with theoretical predictions. It also demonstrated strong performance in content generation and restoration across various applications, including noisy conditions.

Conclusion: The PRBM's scalability, reduced training costs, and performance under noise suggest its potential to drive advancements in photonic computing and generative AI, offering an innovative solution to longstanding computational challenges.

Abstract: The restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a neural network based on the Ising
model, well known for its ability to learn probability distributions and
stochastically generate new content. However, the high computational cost of
Gibbs sampling in content generation tasks imposes significant bottlenecks on
electronic implementations. Here, we propose a photonic restricted Boltzmann
machine (PRBM) that leverages photonic computing to accelerate Gibbs sampling,
enabling efficient content generation. By introducing an efficient encoding
method, the PRBM eliminates the need for computationally intensive matrix
decomposition and reduces the computational complexity of Gibbs sampling from
$O(N)$ to $O(1)$. Moreover, its non-Von Neumann photonic computing architecture
circumvents the memory storage of interaction matrices, providing substantial
advantages for large-scale RBMs. We experimentally validate the
photonic-accelerated Gibbs sampling by simulating a two-dimensional Ising
model, where the observed phase transition temperature closely matches the
theoretical predictions. Beyond physics-inspired tasks, the PRBM demonstrates
robust capabilities in generating and restoring diverse content, including
images and temporal sequences, even in the presence of noise and aberrations.
The scalability and reduced training cost of the PRBM framework underscore its
potential as a promising pathway for advancing photonic computing in generative
artificial intelligence.
