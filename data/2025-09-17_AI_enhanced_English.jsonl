To alleviate this, Tile\nSpatial Scheduling (TSS) reduces such costs by fragmenting inter-layer data\ninto smaller tiles communicated via on-chip links.However, many emerging\napplications require concurrent execution of multiple DNNs with complex\ntopologies, where critical tasks must preempt others to meet stringent latency\nrequirements (e.g., in autonomous driving, obstacle detection must complete\nwithin tens of milliseconds). Existing TSS works lack support for preemption,\nwhile prior preemption schemes rely on LTS and thus inherit its overheads. This\nhighlights the need for preemptive and efficient TSS-based frameworks. Yet,\nrealizing such systems is challenging due to the complexity of enabling\npreemption in graphs with large-scale topologies (e.g., modern large language\nmodels may contain tens of thousands of edges). To tackle this, we present\nIsoSched, the first framework enabling preemptive multi-DNN scheduling on TSS\narchitecture.

METHODS: We used\n24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM\nwas prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and\nfive macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their\nquantities.
