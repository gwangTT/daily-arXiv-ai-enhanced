### [1] [Unifying Post-hoc Explanations of Knowledge Graph Completions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22951)
*Alessandro Lonardi,Samy Badreddine,Tarek R. Besold,Pablo Sanchez Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified framework for post-hoc explainability in Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) and introduces improved evaluation protocols to enhance reproducibility and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to post-hoc explainability in KGC lack standardization, formalization, and consistent evaluation protocols, leading to poor reproducibility and limited cross-study comparisons.

Method: The paper introduces a framework based on multi-objective optimization to unify post-hoc explainability methods in KGC and enhance evaluation protocols using metrics like Hits@$k$ and Mean Reciprocal Rank. It also emphasizes interpretability for end-user relevance.

Result: The framework consolidates existing post-hoc explainability approaches and empirically validates improved evaluation protocols that better measure interpretability and performance.

Conclusion: This work advances KGC explainability research by proposing a unified approach that improves reproducibility, introduces standard evaluation methods, and emphasizes meaningful interpretability for end-users.

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) lacks
formalization and consistent evaluations, hindering reproducibility and
cross-study comparisons. This paper argues for a unified approach to post-hoc
explainability in KGC. First, we propose a general framework to characterize
post-hoc explanations via multi-objective optimization, balancing their
effectiveness and conciseness. This unifies existing post-hoc explainability
algorithms in KGC and the explanations they produce. Next, we suggest and
empirically support improved evaluation protocols using popular metrics like
Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$. Finally, we stress the importance of
interpretability as the ability of explanations to address queries meaningful
to end-users. By unifying methods and refining evaluation standards, this work
aims to make research in KGC explainability more reproducible and impactful.

### [2] [Data Readiness for Scientific AI at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23018)
*Wesley Brewer,Patrick Widener,Valentine Anantharaj,Feiyi Wang,Tom Beck,Arjun Shankar,Sarp Oral*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for adapting scientific datasets for AI, focusing on workflows in climate, nuclear fusion, bio/health, and materials domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable and reproducible AI for science by addressing data preprocessing challenges in leadership-scale datasets.

Method: The authors propose a two-dimensional readiness framework combining Data Readiness Levels and Data Processing Stages, tailored to HPC environments.

Result: The framework highlights challenges in preparing data for scalable AI training, especially for transformer-based models, and offers a maturity matrix to guide infrastructure development.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a standardized approach to transforming scientific data for cross-domain AI applications, aiding in infrastructure improvement for AI in science.

Abstract: This paper examines how Data Readiness for AI (DRAI) principles apply to
leadership-scale scientific datasets used to train foundation models. We
analyze archetypal workflows across four representative domains - climate,
nuclear fusion, bio/health, and materials - to identify common preprocessing
patterns and domain-specific constraints. We introduce a two-dimensional
readiness framework composed of Data Readiness Levels (raw to AI-ready) and
Data Processing Stages (ingest to shard), both tailored to high performance
computing (HPC) environments. This framework outlines key challenges in
transforming scientific data for scalable AI training, emphasizing
transformer-based generative models. Together, these dimensions form a
conceptual maturity matrix that characterizes scientific data readiness and
guides infrastructure development toward standardized, cross-domain support for
scalable and reproducible AI for science.

### [3] [FairReason: Balancing Reasoning and Social Bias in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23067)
*Zhenyu Pan,Yutong Zhang,Jianshu Zhang,Haoran Lu,Haozheng Luo,Yuwei Han,Philip S. Yu,Manling Li,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores balancing reasoning capabilities and social bias mitigation in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), benchmarking various methods and identifying an optimal mix of debias-focused and reasoning-centric training samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address how reasoning gains in MLLMs interact with efforts to mitigate social biases, and whether these two objectives inherently conflict.

Method: The method includes benchmarking three bias-mitigation strategies (SFT, KD, RL) under identical conditions and varying training sample proportions to examine the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and bias reduction.

Result: The study finds that a 1:4 mix of debias-focused to reasoning-centric samples, trained with reinforcement learning, reduces stereotype scores by 10% while maintaining 88% of the model’s reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: The results provide actionable insights for achieving a balance between bias mitigation and reasoning capability in MLLMs using a defined training mix ratio.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art
results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning
ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and
post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy,
they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social
biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and
whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and
pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three
bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation
(KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions,
establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these
results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples
within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps
reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement
learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's
original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness
and capability in MLLMs.

### [4] [Moravec's Paradox: Towards an Auditory Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23091)
*David Noever,Forrest McKee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study finds AI systems fail significantly on auditory tasks simple for humans, introducing an auditory Turing test where top models showed over 93% failure rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose and understand the gap between human auditory capabilities and machine performance on tasks humans find effortless.

Method: Developed an auditory Turing test with 917 challenges across categories like overlapping speech, noise robustness, and perceptual illusions. Evaluated state-of-the-art models including GPT-4 and Whisper.

Result: AI models demonstrated over 93% failure rates, with the top model scoring 6.9% accuracy compared to 52% for human performance.

Conclusion: AI architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene analysis, necessitating novel approaches like selective attention and context-aware perception for progress in machine listening.

Abstract: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically
on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly. Drawing inspiration from
Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for
machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917
challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise,
temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and
perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including
GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate
exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy
on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results
expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes,
particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual
adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap
but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that
current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene
analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters
that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models.
This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward
human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches
integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and
context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.

### [5] [Argumentatively Coherent Judgmental Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23163)
*Deniz Gorur,Antonio Rago,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'argumentative coherence' as a property for judgmental forecasting and evaluates its impact on both human and AI (LLM-based) predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance judgmental forecasting accuracy by examining argumentative coherence in human and AI forecasters.

Method: The research proposed a formal definition of argumentative coherence and conducted evaluations including filtering incoherent forecasts, assessing the impact on performance, and analyzing user alignment with the coherence property.

Result: Filtering incoherent forecasts improved accuracy for both human and LLM-based predictions, although users often failed to intuitively align with the coherence property.

Conclusion: To improve judgmental forecasting, mechanisms must be implemented to filter incoherent opinions before deriving group-based forecasting predictions.

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about
future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative
forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around
forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an
argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a
property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a
forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three
evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of
enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model
(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive
with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent
predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the
practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via
crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent
intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence
property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based
judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before
obtaining group forecasting predictions.

### [6] [Tractable Responsibility Measures for Ontology-Mediated Query Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23191)
*Meghyn Bienvenu,Diego Figueira,Pierre Lafourcade*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates the complexity of computing Shapley-value-based responsibility scores in the context of ontology-mediated query answering, identifying both tractable and intractable cases depending on query types and ontology languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to understand the computational challenges of using responsibility measures (inspired by Shapley values) to quantify the contributions of individual facts to query answers within ontology-mediated settings.

Method: The authors analyze the computational complexity of responsibility score calculation, distinguishing between data complexity for first-order-rewritable queries and combined complexity for structurally restricted conjunctive queries under different ontology languages.

Result: The findings show polynomial data complexity for first-order-rewritable queries, while reachability-supporting ontologies make the problem hard ("shP-hard"). Structurally restricted queries in DL-Lite dialects enable tractability, but intractability arises in more expressive or unconstrained query classes.

Conclusion: This work advances understanding of the tractability frontier for responsibility computations in ontology-mediated queries, providing both theoretical foundations and practical insights for using Shapley-value-based measures in database and ontology systems.

Abstract: Recent work on quantitative approaches to explaining query answers employs
responsibility measures to assign scores to facts in order to quantify their
respective contributions to obtaining a given answer. In this paper, we study
the complexity of computing such responsibility scores in the setting of
ontology-mediated query answering, focusing on a very recently introduced
family of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of
weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the
database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data
complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are
first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes "shP"-hard when the
ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\exists R.
A \sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next
explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that
intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language
supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive
queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields
positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we
identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which
intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit
tractable WSMS computation.

### [7] [Solution-aware vs global ReLU selection: partial MILP strikes back for DNN verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23197)
*Yuke Liao,Blaise Genest,Kuldeep Meel,Shaan Aryaman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper improves Neural Network verification using a divide-and-conquer approach with solution-aware scoring for ReLU selection, reducing complexity while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex and costly Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) calls are required for verifying large CNNs, especially concerning ReLU variables.

Method: Used solution-aware ReLU scoring (SAS) and global ReLU scoring (GS) in a divide-and-conquer model to select critical ReLU variables for efficient MILP calls.

Result: Reduced binary variables by ~6 times and decreased undecided instances by up to 40%, with reasonable runtimes between 46s-417s.

Conclusion: The methods enhance verification efficiency and accuracy for large CNNs, making verification practical for networks with millions of parameters.

Abstract: To handle complex instances, we revisit a divide-and-conquer approach to
break down the complexity: instead of few complex BaB calls, we rely on many
small {\em partial} MILP calls. The crucial step is to select very few but very
important ReLUs to treat using (costly) binary variables. The previous attempts
were suboptimal in that respect. To select these important ReLU variables, we
propose a novel {\em solution-aware} ReLU scoring ({\sf SAS}), as well as adapt
the BaB-SR and BaB-FSB branching functions as {\em global} ReLU scoring ({\sf
GS}) functions. We compare them theoretically as well as experimentally, and
{\sf SAS} is more efficient at selecting a set of variables to open using
binary variables. Compared with previous attempts, SAS reduces the number of
binary variables by around 6 times, while maintaining the same level of
accuracy. Implemented in {\em Hybrid MILP}, calling first $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN
with a short time-out to solve easier instances, and then partial MILP,
produces a very accurate yet efficient verifier, reducing by up to $40\%$ the
number of undecided instances to low levels ($8-15\%$), while keeping a
reasonable runtime ($46s-417s$ on average per instance), even for fairly large
CNNs with 2 million parameters.

this question, we provide a prospect-driven review that comprehensively
analyzes the current achievements of AI Scientist systems, identifying key
bottlenecks and the critical components required for the emergence of a
scientific agent capable of producing ground-breaking discoveries that solve
grand challenges. We hope this survey will contribute to a clearer
understanding of limitations of current AI Scientist systems, showing where we
are, what is missing, and what the ultimate goals for scientific AI should be.

### [9] [AI Must not be Fully Autonomous](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23330)
*Tosin Adewumi,Lama Alkhaled,Florent Imbert,Hui Han,Nudrat Habib,Karl Löwenmark*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the levels of autonomous AI and argues against fully autonomous AI due to associated risks, particularly as artificial superintelligence advances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the growing concern over AI autonomy and the potential risks of artificial superintelligence developing objectives independently.

Method: The authors outline 3 levels of AI autonomy, present 12 arguments along with 6 counterarguments and their rebuttals, and provide 15 pieces of evidence showcasing risks of misaligned AI values.

Result: The analysis identifies the dangers of autonomous level 3 AI and emphasizes how responsible human oversight can mitigate these risks.

Conclusion: The paper advocates against fully autonomous AI and emphasizes the importance of human control to ensure safety and ethical alignment in AI development.

Abstract: Autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) has many benefits. It also has many
risks. In this work, we identify the 3 levels of autonomous AI. We are of the
position that AI must not be fully autonomous because of the many risks,
especially as artificial superintelligence (ASI) is speculated to be just
decades away. Fully autonomous AI, which can develop its own objectives, is at
level 3 and without responsible human oversight. However, responsible human
oversight is crucial for mitigating the risks. To ague for our position, we
discuss theories of autonomy, AI and agents. Then, we offer 12 distinct
arguments and 6 counterarguments with rebuttals to the counterarguments. We
also present 15 pieces of recent evidence of AI misaligned values and other
risks in the appendix.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate LLM data science agents across three models and approaches, analyzing performance on various tasks and prompting issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic benchmarks for evaluating specialized data science agents driven by large language models (LLMs).

Method: The authors designed a benchmark reflecting real-world user interactions and assessed three LLMs (Claude-4.0-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-Flash, OpenAI-o4-Mini) using three approaches: zero-shot with context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and SmolAgent across eight task categories.

Result: Distinct performance disparities were observed among the evaluated models and methods, with detailed exploration of prompting issues like data leakage and temperature parameter influences.

Conclusion: The benchmark offers critical insights into the performance and practical deployment factors of LLM-based data science agents, providing a foundation for future research to improve their robustness and effectiveness.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted
data science workflows, giving rise to specialized data science agents designed
to automate analytical tasks. Despite rapid adoption, systematic benchmarks
evaluating the efficacy and limitations of these agents remain scarce. In this
paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark specifically crafted to reflect
real-world user interactions with data science agents by observing usage of our
commercial applications. We evaluate three LLMs: Claude-4.0-Sonnet,
Gemini-2.5-Flash, and OpenAI-o4-Mini across three approaches: zero-shot with
context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and with SmolAgent.
Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science
task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common
prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We
further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and
task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal
distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies,
highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark
dataset and evaluation framework introduced herein aim to provide a foundation
for future research of more robust and effective data science agents.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM4Rail, a language model-driven platform for improving railway services through personalized modules and unique frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To meet the rising demand for personalized railway service and leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs).

Method: The authors develop an iterative 'Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)' prompting framework and curate a specialized dataset (CRFD-25) for railway dining services.

Result: LLM4Rail provides tailored functionalities for railway service areas with enhanced reasoning and recommendation features, including food recommendations that align with the CRFD-25 dataset.

Conclusion: LLM4Rail integrates LLMs and custom frameworks to innovatively address real-world railway service challenges, enhancing user experience.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped different walks of
business. To meet the increasing demands for individualized railway service, we
develop LLM4Rail - a novel LLM-augmented railway service consulting platform.
Empowered by LLM, LLM4Rail can provide custom modules for ticketing, railway
food & drink recommendations, weather information, and chitchat. In LLM4Rail,
we propose the iterative "Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)" prompting
framework. It meticulously integrates verbal reasoning with task-oriented
actions, that is, reasoning to guide action selection, to effectively retrieve
external observations relevant to railway operation and service to generate
accurate responses. To provide personalized onboard dining services, we first
construct the Chinese Railway Food and Drink (CRFD-25) - a publicly accessible
takeout dataset tailored for railway services. CRFD-25 covers a wide range of
signature dishes categorized by cities, cuisines, age groups, and spiciness
levels. We further introduce an LLM-based zero-shot conversational recommender
for railway catering. To address the unconstrained nature of open
recommendations, the feature similarity-based post-processing step is
introduced to ensure all the recommended items are aligned with CRFD-25
dataset.

### [13] [Self-Foveate: Enhancing Diversity and Difficulty of Synthesized Instructions from Unsupervised Text via Multi-Level Foveation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23440)
*Mingzhe Li,Xin Lu,Yanyan Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Self-Foveate, an innovative method to improve the diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions for training large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods of synthesizing instructional data for LLMs rely either on human labor, which is costly, or automated processes, which often fail to produce diverse and challenging instructions.

Method: The authors propose a novel 'Micro-Scatter-Macro' multi-level foveation approach that allows the LLM to extract more nuanced and varied information from unsupervised text.

Result: Experimental validation across multiple unsupervised datasets and LLM architectures shows that Self-Foveate enhances the quality of synthesized instructions in terms of both diversity and complexity.

Conclusion: Self-Foveate addresses key limitations in existing data synthesis methods, providing a scalable and efficient solution for producing high-quality training data for LLMs. Their work is made publicly accessible through shared data and code.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with instruction following capabilities have
demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities. While synthesizing
instructional data from unsupervised text has become a common approach for
training such models, conventional methods rely heavily on human effort for
data annotation. Although existing automated synthesis paradigms have
alleviated this constraint, they still exhibit significant limitations in
ensuring adequate diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Foveate, an innovative LLM-driven
method for instruction synthesis. This approach introduces a
"Micro-Scatter-Macro" multi-level foveation methodology that effectively guides
the LLM to deeply excavate fine-grained information embedded in unsupervised
text, thereby enhancing both the diversity and difficulty of synthesized
instructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple unsupervised corpora
and diverse model architectures validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method. We publicly release our data and codes:

### [14] [Causal Reasoning in Pieces: Modular In-Context Learning for Causal Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23488)
*Kacper Kadziolka,Saber Salehkaleybar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates the capability of state-of-the-art reasoning models to robustly perform causal discovery, showing improvements through structured in-context pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of causal inference using large language models, an area where conventional models struggle.

Method: The study compares reasoning-first model architectures, introduces a modular in-context pipeline inspired by Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, and evaluates their impact on causal discovery.

Result: Reasoning-first architectures achieved significant native gains, with the proposed pipeline delivering nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines.

Conclusion: Advanced reasoning models can significantly enhance causal discovery performance when combined with well-structured in-context frameworks, offering a scalable approach across domains.

Abstract: Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models.
Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked
interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform
causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe
overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations. We study
causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's
o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first
architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches.
To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline
inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding
nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines. We further probe
the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and
conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and
reasoning models. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models
represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context
frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a
generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains.

### [15] [Causal Identification of Sufficient, Contrastive and Complete Feature Sets in Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23497)
*David A Kelly,Hana Chockler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces formal causal explanations for image classifiers, including novel contrastive and confidence-aware definitions, providing efficient, model-agnostic, black-box solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explanation algorithms for image classifiers lack formal rigor, while logic-based methods, though rigorous, are impractical due to restrictive assumptions. The paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The paper presents causal explanations with formal properties, introduces contrastive and confidence-aware explanations, and implements algorithms that are efficient, black-box, and model-agnostic.

Result: Experimental results show differences in sufficiency, contrastiveness, and completeness across models, with algorithms taking approximately 6 seconds per image on a ResNet50 model.

Conclusion: Causal explanations are robust, rigorously defined, and computationally efficient, making them a suitable and practical approach for explaining image classifier decisions.

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based
on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On
the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined
but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do
not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being
formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as
logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and
being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal
explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image
classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence
awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are
classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that
different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and
completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s
per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are
totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model
internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as
monotonicity, of the model.

### [16] [DICE: Dynamic In-Context Example Selection in LLM Agents via Efficient Knowledge Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23554)
*Ruoyu Wang,Junda Wu,Yu Xia,Tong Yu,Ryan A. Rossi,Julian McAuley,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes DICE, a framework to improve the demonstration selection process in in-context learning (ICL) for large language model (LLM) agents, enhancing their reasoning and task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for selecting in-context learning demonstrations depend on heuristics or task-specific designs, leading to suboptimal and unstable performance. A general, theoretically grounded approach for selecting demonstrations is lacking.

Method: The authors introduce DICE, a causal framework that decomposes demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components, helping eliminate spurious dependencies. DICE also proposes a stepwise selection criterion to consistently enhance agent performance, acting as a plug-in module for existing agentic frameworks.

Result: Extensive experiments show that DICE improves reasoning performance and generalization capabilities across diverse domains, validating its methodical approach to dynamic demo selection.

Conclusion: DICE serves as a general, theoretically supported solution for dynamic demonstration selection in LLM agents, producing more robust and efficient outcomes without requiring additional training effort.

Abstract: Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL),
have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks.
However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly
sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often
leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored
example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing
approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a
general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective
demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a
principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that
consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this
challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a
theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most
relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes
demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components
through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious
dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise
selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.
Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be
integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any
additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the
importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient
LLM agents.

### [17] [Semantic Chain-of-Trust: Autonomous Trust Orchestration for Collaborator Selection via Hypergraph-Aided Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23565)
*Botao Zhu,Xianbin Wang,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method leveraging agentic AI and hypergraph-based trust orchestration to enable effective and resource-efficient task-specific trust evaluations in collaborative systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of resource-intensive and dynamic trust evaluations in distributed collaborative environments, which negatively impact task execution and resource utilization.

Method: The paper proposes agentic AI combined with hypergraph-based trust orchestration to autonomously assess trust based on historical data during device idle periods and align resource capabilities with task requirements, while maintaining and using trust hypergraphs for hierarchical and multi-hop collaborator management.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed method effectively achieves resource-efficient and accurate trust evaluations.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential for enhancing the utility of constrained resources and improving efficiency in collaborative systems, making it scalable for large-scale environments.

Abstract: In collaborative systems, the effective completion of tasks hinges on
task-specific trust evaluations of potential devices for distributed
collaboration. However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of
distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead
dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust
evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations
can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting
collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an
autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic
chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish
and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in
autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose
agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations
of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle
periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In
addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator
resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task
requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust
semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of
collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on
trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust
accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be
chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient
coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation.

### [18] [MemoCue: Empowering LLM-Based Agents for Human Memory Recall via Strategy-Guided Querying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23633)
*Qian Zhao,Zhuo Sun,Bin Guo,Zhiwen Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MemoCue, an agent-assisted memory recall method that transforms queries into cues via a strategy-guided approach, achieving better recall performance than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent-assisted memory recall approaches are hindered by limited memory modules, affecting the ability to assist in vague or incomplete memory recall.

Method: The paper develops a Recall Router framework using a 5W Recall Map to classify memory scenarios and a hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to optimize strategy selection. Additionally, MemoCue fine-tunes open-source LLMs for generating cue-rich responses.

Result: MemoCue outperforms traditional LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall inspiration across three datasets. Human evaluations further validate its efficacy in memory-recall applications.

Conclusion: MemoCue significantly improves human-computer interaction in memory recall by employing strategy-guided transformations of queries, demonstrating a robust and effective framework for memory recall enhancement.

Abstract: Agent-assisted memory recall is one critical research problem in the field of
human-computer interaction. In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve
information from its equipped memory module to help the person recall
incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the
acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in
practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be
proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose
a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent
to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed
strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key
challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse
forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to
obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only
abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,
we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map
to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen
recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a
hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to
optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We
construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source
large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in
providing memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative
datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall
inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in
memory-recall applications.

*Haipeng Liu,Yuxuan Liu,Ting Long*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR) to enhance personalized question recommendation by improving exploration efficiency compared to existing reinforcement learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-based question recommendation methods struggle with inefficient exploration during their learning process, limiting their ability to identify optimal questions for individual students.

Method: The authors propose RAR, a system that integrates collaborative ideas to optimize the exploration process in reinforcement learning for recommending questions.

Result: RAR demonstrates improved recommendation performance and can generalize to other RL-based question recommendation frameworks.

Conclusion: RAR enhances the efficiency of exploration in RL-based question recommendation systems, providing better personalized question suggestions while being adaptable across different RL frameworks.

Abstract: Personalized question recommendation aims to guide individual students
through questions to enhance their mastery of learning targets. Most previous
methods model this task as a Markov Decision Process and use reinforcement
learning to solve, but they struggle with efficient exploration, failing to
identify the best questions for each student during training. To address this,
we propose Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR), which incorporates
collaborative ideas into the exploration mechanism, enabling more efficient
exploration within limited training episodes. Experiments show that RAR
effectively improves recommendation performance, and our framework can be
applied to any RL-based question recommender. Our code is available in
https://github.com/wuming29/RAR.git.

*Long Phan,Mantas Mazeika,Andy Zou,Dan Hendrycks*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TextQuests is a benchmark assessing AI agents in complex, exploratory environments requiring prolonged intrinsic reasoning, using interactive fiction games as evaluation tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to adequately measure AI agents' autonomous problem-solving abilities in exploratory settings, motivating the need for an alternative assessment approach.

Method: TextQuests employs interactive fiction games from the Infocom suite, which demand hundreds of precise actions and long-term reasoning, to evaluate AI agents' problem-solving skills without external tool assistance.

Result: The benchmark demonstrated potential as a proxy for assessing focused, self-contained reasoning and trial-and-error learning capabilities in AI agents.

Conclusion: TextQuests supports the development and evaluation of AI agents in long-horizon reasoning scenarios, enhancing understanding of intrinsic problem-solving skills in expansive environments.

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror
real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical
capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like
tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an
agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand
sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the
development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long
horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of
interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human
players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve
as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The
benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for
self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby
focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory
environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and
sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release
TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Seed-Prover, a reasoning model using Lean verification to refine proofs, achieving significant progress in solving advanced mathematical problems and proving IMO-level contest challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address LLMs' struggle with theorem proving due to lack of clear supervision signals in natural language environments and leverage domain-specific languages for effective training.

Method: Seed-Prover leverages lemma-style reasoning, iterative refinements with Lean feedback, lemma proofs, and self-summarization. It employs novel test-time inference strategies, broadening and deepening reasoning capabilities, alongside a specialized geometry reasoning engine called Seed-Geometry.

Result: Seed-Prover proves 78.1% of formalized IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F, exceeds 50% on PutnamBench, and significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art solutions. For IMO 2025, it successfully proves 5 out of 6 problems.

Conclusion: Formal verification paired with long chain-of-thought reasoning offers effective solutions for automated mathematical reasoning, advancing capabilities in solving complex problems and enabling participation in contests like IMO.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging
reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to
struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when
solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean
provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective
training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover
can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and
self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three
test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.
Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,
and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in
Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which
outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to
participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work
represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning,
demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long
chain-of-thought reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoT-Self-Instruct, a method to generate synthetic training data using chain-of-thought reasoning, producing better results on multiple benchmarks compared to existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the quality of training data for large language models, especially for tasks requiring reasoning and instruction-following, by leveraging chain-of-thought reasoning techniques.

Method: CoT-Self-Instruct generates synthetic training prompts by first reasoning and planning via chain-of-thought, then synthesizing new prompts similar to seed tasks, and finally filtering for quality using automatic metrics.

Result: The method outperformed existing datasets like s1k and OpenMathReasoning in reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH500, AMC23) and surpassed human or standard self-instruct prompts in instruction-following tasks (e.g., AlpacaEval 2.0).

Conclusion: CoT-Self-Instruct significantly enhances data quality for reasoning and instruction-following, showcasing its potential to improve LLM training on diverse tasks.

Abstract: We propose CoT-Self-Instruct, a synthetic data generation method that
instructs LLMs to first reason and plan via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based on the
given seed tasks, and then to generate a new synthetic prompt of similar
quality and complexity for use in LLM training, followed by filtering for
high-quality data with automatic metrics. In verifiable reasoning, our
synthetic data significantly outperforms existing training datasets, such as
s1k and OpenMathReasoning, across MATH500, AMC23, AIME24 and GPQA-Diamond. For
non-verifiable instruction-following tasks, our method surpasses the
performance of human or standard self-instruct prompts on both AlpacaEval 2.0
and Arena-Hard.

*Mingkai Deng,Jinyu Hou,Yilin Shen,Hongxia Jin,Graham Neubig,Zhiting Hu,Eric Xing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces SimuRA, an AI architecture that uses world-model simulation for generalized reasoning and outperforms autoregressive methods in specific web-browsing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents lack scalability and generality, struggling with the limitations of autoregressive reasoning. Inspired by humans' ability to reason through simulation, the paper aims to create a more generalized agentic reasoning system.

Method: SimuRA leverages a world model implemented with large language models (LLMs) that utilize natural language's latent space to simulate outcomes and plan actions. This approach is validated via experiments on challenging web-browsing tasks.

Result: The proposed method showed a significant performance improvement, with flight search success rates increasing from 0% to 32.2%. World-model-based planning also demonstrated an advantage of up to 124% over autoregressive methods.

Conclusion: World model simulation presents a powerful reasoning framework, paving the way for generalized superintelligent agents built on LLMs. A research demo of the web-browsing agent SimuRA is made publicly available.

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but
current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls
short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental
limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general
agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and
plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce
SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based
on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname
overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world
model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented
using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the
concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web
browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from
0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent
advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the
advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited
about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs
that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,
a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a
research demo for public testing.

TL;DR: This study evaluates two Large Language Models (Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7B) for improving data consistency in an online property booking platform, CALEIDOHOTELS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of incomplete and inconsistent property data from third-party providers on booking platforms, improving user experience and platform reliability.

Method: The study employed two LLMs (Mistral 7B fine-tuned with QLoRA and Mixtral 8x7B with a refined prompt) to generate consistent and concise property descriptions. Performance metrics included completeness, precision, hallucination rate, word count, and computational costs.

Result: Mixtral 8x7B performed better in completeness (99.6% vs. 93%), precision (98.8% vs. 96%), and hallucination rate (1.2% vs. 4%). It produced shorter content but required significantly more computational resources.

Conclusion: The research highlights the trade-offs between model quality and computational resource efficiency, offering insights for deploying LLMs effectively in commercial applications while improving data reliability.

Abstract: Online property booking platforms are widely used and rely heavily on
consistent, up-to-date information about accommodation facilities, often
sourced from third-party providers. However, these external data sources are
frequently affected by incomplete or inconsistent details, which can frustrate
users and result in a loss of market. In response to these challenges, we
present an industrial case study involving the integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs) into CALEIDOHOTELS, a property reservation platform developed by
FERVENTO. We evaluate two well-known LLMs in this context: Mistral 7B,
fine-tuned with QLoRA, and Mixtral 8x7B, utilized with a refined system prompt.
Both models were assessed based on their ability to generate consistent and
homogeneous descriptions while minimizing hallucinations. Mixtral 8x7B
outperformed Mistral 7B in terms of completeness (99.6% vs. 93%), precision
(98.8% vs. 96%), and hallucination rate (1.2% vs. 4%), producing shorter yet
more concise content (249 vs. 277 words on average). However, this came at a
significantly higher computational cost: 50GB VRAM and $1.61/hour versus 5GB
and $0.16/hour for Mistral 7B. Our findings provide practical insights into the
trade-offs between model quality and resource efficiency, offering guidance for
deploying LLMs in production environments and demonstrating their effectiveness
in enhancing the consistency and reliability of accommodation data.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ElectriQ, a benchmark and approach to enhance large language models (LLMs) for electric power marketing services, addressing shortcomings in current customer service systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Customer service in electric power marketing is hindered by slow responses and lack of domain-specific adaptability. Current LLMs lack the necessary expertise and empathy for this field.

Method: The study introduces ElectriQ: a dialogue dataset across six service categories and four evaluation metrics (professionalism, popularity, readability, user-friendliness). A domain-specific knowledge base and a knowledge augmentation method are applied to boost smaller LLMs.

Result: Experiments on 13 LLMs show that fine-tuned smaller models like LLama3-8B can outperform GPT-4o in professionalism and user-friendliness within this domain.

Conclusion: ElectriQ provides a robust foundation for customizing LLMs to meet the specific needs of the power marketing service industry, addressing the limitations of existing systems and enhancing model performance.

Abstract: Electric power marketing customer service plays a critical role in addressing
inquiries, complaints, and service requests. However, current systems, such as
China's 95598 hotline, often struggle with slow response times, inflexible
procedures, and limited accuracy in domain-specific tasks. While large language
models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and Claude 3 demonstrate strong general capabilities,
they lack the domain expertise and empathy required in this field. To bridge
this gap, we introduce ElectriQ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and
enhance LLMs in electric power marketing scenarios. ElectriQ consists of a
dialogue dataset covering six key service categories and introduces four
evaluation metrics: professionalism, popularity, readability, and
user-friendliness. We further incorporate a domain-specific knowledge base and
propose a knowledge augmentation method to boost model performance. Experiments
on 13 LLMs reveal that smaller models such as LLama3-8B, when fine-tuned and
augmented, can surpass GPT-4o in terms of professionalism and
user-friendliness. ElectriQ establishes a comprehensive foundation for
developing LLMs tailored to the needs of power marketing services.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops a hierarchical classification framework to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse platforms using a combination of fine-tuned language models and semi-supervised ensemble learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting illicit marketplace content online is challenging due to limited labeled data, evolving language, and structural diversity among platforms.

Method: The researchers use a transformer model (ModernBERT) fine-tuned on specialized illicit data and integrate manually engineered features. A two-stage pipeline is employed: the first stage detects sales-related texts, and the second classifies them into drug, weapon, or credential sales using a semi-supervised ensemble approach.

Result: The proposed model outperformed existing baselines with metrics such as 0.96489 accuracy, 0.93467 F1-score, and 0.95388 TMCC, proving effective across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The hierarchical framework exhibits strong performance and robustness in detecting illicit marketplace content under minimal supervision, enhancing real-world applicability.

Abstract: Illegal marketplaces have increasingly shifted to concealed parts of the
internet, including the deep and dark web, as well as platforms such as
Telegram, Reddit, and Pastebin. These channels enable the anonymous trade of
illicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and
categorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the
evolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online
sources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that
combines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning
strategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse
platforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer
model for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark
web pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture
specialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we
incorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded
patterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which
complement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in
two stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random
Forest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related
documents. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or
credential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source
corpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines,
including BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of
0.95388, demonstrating strong generalization, robustness under limited
supervision, and effectiveness in real-world illicit content detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid system combining machine learning models and large language models (LLMs) for improved subject analysis of library resources, enhancing term prediction accuracy and mitigating hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for subject analysis struggle with unseen cases and over-generation issues, leading to inaccurate or extraneous term predictions.

Method: A hybrid framework incorporates embedding-based machine learning models to predict the number of subject terms and refine LLM-generated terms using Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH).

Result: The hybrid approach demonstrated improved control and alignment with LCSH vocabulary, addressing the over-generation and hallucination problems in LLMs.

Conclusion: Integrating ML models with LLMs offers a promising solution for robust and accurate subject analysis in library systems.

Abstract: Providing subject access to information resources is an essential function of
any library management system. Large language models (LLMs) have been widely
used in classification and summarization tasks, but their capability to perform
subject analysis is underexplored. Multi-label classification with traditional
machine learning (ML) models has been used for subject analysis but struggles
with unseen cases. LLMs offer an alternative but often over-generate and
hallucinate. Therefore, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates
embedding-based ML models with LLMs. This approach uses ML models to (1)
predict the optimal number of LCSH labels to guide LLM predictions and (2)
post-edit the predicted terms with actual LCSH terms to mitigate
hallucinations. We experimented with LLMs and the hybrid framework to predict
the subject terms of books using the Library of Congress Subject Headings
(LCSH). Experiment results show that providing initial predictions to guide LLM
generations and imposing post-edits result in more controlled and
vocabulary-aligned outputs.

### [28] [Full Triple Matcher: Integrating all triple elements between heterogeneous Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22914)
*Victor Eiti Yamamoto,Hideaki Takeda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method for integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with a focus on context matching using label and triple matching techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current entity matching methods for KGs often fail in scenarios with diverse and complex contexts due to varying sources, sizes, and information densities.

Method: The approach combines label matching using string manipulation, fuzzy matching, vector similarity, and triple matching to align entities and predicates while improving entity-matching accuracy.

Result: The proposed method achieved high accuracy compared to leading systems in the OAEI competition and supervised methods, and a new dataset was introduced for evaluating triple matching.

Conclusion: The novel integration method effectively bridges the gap in context matching within KGs and shows competitive results on diverse datasets.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for representing and reasoning over
structured information. Their main components include schema, identity, and
context. While schema and identity matching are well-established in ontology
and entity matching research, context matching remains largely unexplored. This
is particularly important because real-world KGs often vary significantly in
source, size, and information density - factors not typically represented in
the datasets on which current entity matching methods are evaluated. As a
result, existing approaches may fall short in scenarios where diverse and
complex contexts need to be integrated.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel KG integration method consisting of
label matching and triple matching. We use string manipulation, fuzzy matching,
and vector similarity techniques to align entity and predicate labels. Next, we
identify mappings between triples that convey comparable information, using
these mappings to improve entity-matching accuracy. Our approach demonstrates
competitive performance compared to leading systems in the OAEI competition and
against supervised methods, achieving high accuracy across diverse test cases.
Additionally, we introduce a new dataset derived from the benchmark dataset to
evaluate the triple-matching step more comprehensively.

### [29] [Theoretical Foundations and Mitigation of Hallucination in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22915)
*Esmail Gumaan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper methodically examines hallucination in large language models (LLMs), providing formal definitions and theoretical analysis, along with strategies for detection, mitigation, and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the significant challenge of hallucination in LLMs, which impacts their reliability and trustworthiness in generating accurate outputs.

Method: Formal definitions, theoretical learning-theoretic frameworks, and demonstrations of detection and mitigation techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation and fine-tuning were utilized.

Result: Development of a unified workflow combining detection and mitigation strategies; recommended datasets, metrics, and setups to evaluate hallucination risk.

Conclusion: The study establishes theoretical and practical tools to combat hallucination in LLMs, aiding future advancements in creating more robust AI systems.

Abstract: Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the generation of
content that is not faithful to the input or the real-world facts. This paper
provides a rigorous treatment of hallucination in LLMs, including formal
definitions and theoretical analyses. We distinguish between intrinsic and
extrinsic hallucinations, and define a \textit{hallucination risk} for models.
We derive bounds on this risk using learning-theoretic frameworks (PAC-Bayes
and Rademacher complexity). We then survey detection strategies for
hallucinations, such as token-level uncertainty estimation, confidence
calibration, and attention alignment checks. On the mitigation side, we discuss
approaches including retrieval-augmented generation, hallucination-aware
fine-tuning, logit calibration, and the incorporation of fact-verification
modules. We propose a unified detection and mitigation workflow, illustrated
with a diagram, to integrate these strategies. Finally, we outline evaluation
protocols for hallucination, recommending datasets, metrics, and experimental
setups to quantify and reduce hallucinations. Our work lays a theoretical
foundation and practical guidelines for addressing the crucial challenge of
hallucination in LLMs.

### [30] [Reading Between the Timelines: RAG for Answering Diachronic Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22917)
*Kwun Hang Lau,Ruiyuan Zhang,Weijie Shi,Xiaofang Zhou,Xiaojun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses RAG's limitation in handling longitudinal queries by introducing a framework with temporal logic, achieving improved accuracy on a new benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems struggle with longitudinal queries needing both semantic and temporal coherence, prompting the need for a redesigned methodology.

Method: The proposed framework enhances RAG by splitting queries into core subjects and time windows, using a retriever that balances semantic and temporal relevance, tested against the new ADQAB benchmark.

Result: The framework demonstrated 13% to 27% improvement in answer accuracy over traditional RAG systems on the ADQAB benchmark.

Conclusion: The work successfully expands RAG systems' capabilities in longitudinal analysis, making complex real-world temporal queries more manageable.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) excels at injecting static,
factual knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), it exhibits a critical
deficit in handling longitudinal queries that require tracking entities and
phenomena across time. This blind spot arises because conventional,
semantically-driven retrieval methods are not equipped to gather evidence that
is both topically relevant and temporally coherent for a specified duration. We
address this challenge by proposing a new framework that fundamentally
redesigns the RAG pipeline to infuse temporal logic. Our methodology begins by
disentangling a user's query into its core subject and its temporal window. It
then employs a specialized retriever that calibrates semantic matching against
temporal relevance, ensuring the collection of a contiguous evidence set that
spans the entire queried period. To enable rigorous evaluation of this
capability, we also introduce the Analytical Diachronic Question Answering
Benchmark (ADQAB), a challenging evaluation suite grounded in a hybrid corpus
of real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show that our
approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy, surpassing standard RAG
implementations by 13% to 27%. This work provides a validated pathway toward
RAG systems capable of performing the nuanced, evolutionary analysis required
for complex, real-world questions. The dataset and code for this study are
publicly available at https://github.com/kwunhang/TA-RAG.

*Daniel Son,Sanjana Rathore,Andrew Rufail,Adrian Simon,Daniel Zhang,Soham Dave,Cole Blondin,Kevin Zhu,Sean O'Brien*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines if language models of different scales (Gemma-2-2B and Gemma-2-9B) share similar internal features, finding strong overlap in middle layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if models with a significant scale difference develop comparable internal feature representations, supporting cross-model interpretability.

Method: Used Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) dictionary-learning to analyze residual-stream activations, align features by activation correlation, and compare matched spaces with SVCCA and RSA. Extended analysis included multi-token semantic subspaces.

Result: Found high similarity in middle-layer features of both models, with reduced alignment in early and late layers. Similar subspaces also interacted similarly with the models.

Conclusion: Large language models of varying sizes tend to develop analogous, interpretable features, especially in middle layers, supporting feature universality and cross-model interpretability.

Abstract: We investigate feature universality in Gemma-2 language models (Gemma-2-2B
and Gemma-2-9B), asking whether models with a four-fold difference in scale
still converge on comparable internal concepts. Using the Sparse Autoencoder
(SAE) dictionary-learning pipeline, we utilize SAEs on each model's
residual-stream activations, align the resulting monosemantic features via
activation correlation, and compare the matched feature spaces with SVCCA and
RSA. Middle layers yield the strongest overlap, while early and late layers
show far less similarity. Preliminary experiments extend the analysis from
single tokens to multi-token subspaces, showing that semantically similar
subspaces interact similarly with language models. These results strengthen the
case that large language models carve the world into broadly similar,
interpretable features despite size differences, reinforcing universality as a
foundation for cross-model interpretability.

### [32] [A novel language model for predicting serious adverse event results in clinical trials from their prospective registrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22919)
*Qixuan Hu,Xumou Zhang,Jinman Kim,Florence Bourgeois,Adam G. Dunn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper develops prediction models to estimate serious adverse events (SAE) in clinical trials using pre-registered trial data, achieving solid results with advanced methods combining pretrained language models and a sliding window approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent unnecessary risks to participants and avoid trial terminations by accurately predicting SAE outcomes before clinical trials are conducted.

Method: Two prediction models were developed: a classifier to identify which arm has higher SAE rates and a regression model to predict the proportion of SAEs. A transfer learning approach using ClinicalT5 and BioBERT for feature extraction and a sliding window method for embedding long texts were utilized.

Result: The ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP model achieved 77.6% AUC for identifying the trial arm with higher SAE rates and RMSE of 18.6% for predicting SAE proportions in the control arm. The sliding window approach improved classifier AUC by 2.00% and regressor RMSE by 1.58%.

Conclusion: Leveraging summary data from ClinicalTrials.gov using advanced machine learning methods can enhance trial design and safety expectation assessments, showing great promise for optimizing clinical trial processes.

Abstract: Objectives: With accurate estimates of expected safety results, clinical
trials could be designed to avoid terminations and limit exposing participants
to unnecessary risks. We evaluated methods for predicting serious adverse event
(SAE) results in clinical trials using information only from their
registrations prior to the trial. Material and Methods: We analysed 22,107
two-arm parallel interventional clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov with
structured summary results. Two prediction models were developed: a classifier
predicting will experimental arm have higher SAE rates (area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve; AUC) than control arm, and a regression model
to predict the proportion of SAEs in control arms (root mean squared error;
RMSE). A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g.,
ClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with downstream
model for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts
exceeding localised language model input limits, a sliding window method was
developed for embedding extraction. Results: The best model
(ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC predicting which trial arm has a
higher proportion of patients with SAEs. When predicting proportion of
participants experiencing SAE in the control arm, the same model achieved RMSE
of 18.6%. The sliding window approach consistently outperformed methods without
it. Across 12 classifiers, the average absolute AUC increase was 2.00%; across
12 regressors, the average absolute RMSE reduction was 1.58%. Discussion:
Summary results data available at ClinicalTrials.gov remains underutilised. The
potential to estimate results of trials before they start is an opportunity to
improve trial design and flag discrepancies between expected and reported
safety results.

*Jindong Li,Yali Fu,Jiahong Liu,Linxiao Cao,Wei Ji,Menglin Yang,Irwin King,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper surveys vector quantization (VQ) techniques for transforming multimodal data into discrete tokens for LLM processing, offering analysis and emerging challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for converting continuous multimodal data into discrete representations compatible with LLM architectures and fill the gap in systematic examination of VQ techniques.

Method: The paper provides a structured taxonomy and analysis of 8 VQ variants, examines their principles, integration into LLMs, discusses challenges, and proposes emerging research directions.

Result: The survey identifies challenges in VQ techniques such as codebook collapse and gradient instability, and explores how quantization impacts LLM performance across various applications.

Conclusion: This work bridges traditional VQ and modern LLM applications, offering foundational insights for efficient, generalizable multimodal systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
need for effective mechanisms to transform continuous multimodal data into
discrete representations suitable for language-based processing. Discrete
tokenization, with vector quantization (VQ) as a central approach, offers both
computational efficiency and compatibility with LLM architectures. Despite its
growing importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey that
systematically examines VQ techniques in the context of LLM-based systems. This
work fills this gap by presenting the first structured taxonomy and analysis of
discrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs. We categorize 8 representative
VQ variants that span classical and modern paradigms and analyze their
algorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration challenges with LLM
pipelines. Beyond algorithm-level investigation, we discuss existing research
in terms of classical applications without LLMs, LLM-based single-modality
systems, and LLM-based multimodal systems, highlighting how quantization
strategies influence alignment, reasoning, and generation performance. In
addition, we identify key challenges including codebook collapse, unstable
gradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints. Finally, we
discuss emerging research directions such as dynamic and task-adaptive
quantization, unified tokenization frameworks, and biologically inspired
codebook learning. This survey bridges the gap between traditional vector
quantization and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference
for the development of efficient and generalizable multimodal systems. A

### [34] [Fast and Accurate Contextual Knowledge Extraction Using Cascading Language Model Chains and Candidate Answers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22921)
*Lee Harris*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Language Model Chain (LMC) algorithm to reduce hallucinations and improve accuracy in language models by using a multi-stage cascade technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problems of high cost and hallucinations inherent to language models, which lead to wasted resources and incorrect information.

Method: The proposed LMC algorithm ensures a language model's response is cross-checked with a collection of candidate answers, and incorrect responses are further processed by more predictive models in a multi-stage cascade.

Result: Applying the LMC algorithm to extract patient birth dates from medical documents significantly improved prediction accuracy and speed while reducing hallucinations compared to using individual language models.

Conclusion: The LMC algorithm offers a significant contribution to knowledge extraction and holds potential for further exploration in improving language model performance.

Abstract: Language models can capture complex relationships in given text, but these
are notorious for being costly and for producing information that does not
exist (i.e., hallucinations). Furthermore, the resources invested into
producing this information would be wasted if it were incorrect. We address
these issues by proposing, implementing, and applying the Language Model Chain
(LMC) algorithm. In this, a language model's response to a given prompt about
given text is only correct if it exists in the collection of possible (i.e.,
candidate) answers, and text corresponding to incorrect responses is fed into a
more predictive (but slower) language model. This process is repeated for a
collection of language models, or until all predictions about the text are
correct. We used the LMC algorithm to extract patient dates of birth from
medical documents, and combining a collection of language models in a
multi-stage cascade significantly increased prediction speed and accuracy over
individual language models, while greatly reducing the number of corresponding
hallucinations. We believe that the novel LMC algorithm significantly
contributes to the knowledge extraction field, and that this should be explored
much further in the future.

*Mateusz Kmak,Kamil Chmurzyński,Kamil Matejuk,Paweł Kotzbach,Jan Kocoń*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether social media sentiment can predict stock prices, using Reddit discussions on GameStop and AMC, but finds weak correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if online sentiment influences stock prices, especially given the surge in retail investor activity and events like the GameStop short squeeze.

Method: The study used two existing sentiment analysis models and a custom ChatGPT-annotated RoBERTa-based model, analyzing correlation and causality between sentiment, comments volume, Google search trends, and stock price movements.

Result: Social media sentiment showed weak correlation with stock prices, whereas simpler metrics like comment volume and Google search trends had stronger predictive power.

Conclusion: Traditional sentiment analysis may not effectively capture market-moving nuances of retail investor behaviors on social media.

Abstract: The surge of retail investor activity on social media, exemplified by the
2021 GameStop short squeeze, raised questions about the influence of online
sentiment on stock prices. This paper explores whether sentiment derived from
social media discussions can meaningfully predict stock market movements. We
focus on Reddit's r/wallstreetbets and analyze sentiment related to two
companies: GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC). To assess sentiment's
role, we employ two existing text-based sentiment analysis methods and
introduce a third, a ChatGPT-annotated and fine-tuned RoBERTa-based model
designed to better interpret the informal language and emojis prevalent in
social media discussions. We use correlation and causality metrics to determine
these models' predictive power. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that social
media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices. At the same
time, simpler metrics, such as the volume of comments and Google search trends,
exhibit stronger predictive signals. These results highlight the complexity of
retail investor behavior and suggest that traditional sentiment analysis may
not fully capture the nuances of market-moving online discussions.

### [36] [How and Where to Translate? The Impact of Translation Strategies in Cross-lingual LLM Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22923)
*Aman Gupta,Yingying Zhuang,Zhou Yu,Ziji Zhang,Anurag Beniwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates prompt translation strategies in multilingual retrieval-augmented generation systems, finding that optimized strategies significantly enhance performance on classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address variations in multilingual LLM performance caused by cross-lingual challenges in knowledge sharing from high-resource to low-resource languages.

Method: Systematic evaluation of different prompt translation approaches in RAG-enhanced LLMs for multilingual classification tasks.

Result: Optimized prompting strategies greatly improve knowledge sharing across languages and boost classification task performance.

Conclusion: Cross-lingual prompt optimization holds potential for better multilingual resource sharing and enhanced support for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Despite advances in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), their performance varies substantially across different languages and
tasks. In multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems,
knowledge bases (KB) are often shared from high-resource languages (such as
English) to low-resource ones, resulting in retrieved information from the KB
being in a different language than the rest of the context. In such scenarios,
two common practices are pre-translation to create a mono-lingual prompt and
cross-lingual prompting for direct inference. However, the impact of these
choices remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact
of different prompt translation strategies for classification tasks with
RAG-enhanced LLMs in multilingual systems. Experimental results show that an
optimized prompting strategy can significantly improve knowledge sharing across
languages, therefore improve the performance on the downstream classification
task. The findings advocate for a broader utilization of multilingual resource
sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization for non-English languages,
especially the low-resource ones.

*Brittney Exline,Melanie Duffin,Brittany Harbison,Chrissa da Gomez,David Joyner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of native vs. non-native English speaker status on peer feedback experiences in online CS courses in the U.S., finding language background influences feedback sentiment and ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language background influences the experiences of international students engaging in peer feedback within U.S.-based online computing courses.

Method: The study analyzes peer review sentiment using the Twitter-roBERTa-based model and investigates feedback ratings across 500 students, while considering students’ language background, sex, and age.

Result: Findings reveal that native English speakers rate feedback less favorably. Non-native speakers provide more positive sentiment in their reviews but receive less positivity in return. Language background interacts with sex and age to shape these outcomes.

Conclusion: Language background modestly but intricately influences peer feedback dynamics in online computing courses, reflecting both linguistic and social complexities.

Abstract: Graduate-level CS programs in the U.S. increasingly enroll international
students, with 60.2 percent of master's degrees in 2023 awarded to non-U.S.
students. Many of these students take online courses, where peer feedback is
used to engage students and improve pedagogy in a scalable manner. Since these
courses are conducted in English, many students study in a language other than
their first. This paper examines how native versus non-native English speaker
status affects three metrics of peer feedback experience in online U.S.-based
computing courses. Using the Twitter-roBERTa-based model, we analyze the
sentiment of peer reviews written by and to a random sample of 500 students. We
then relate sentiment scores and peer feedback ratings to students' language
background. Results show that native English speakers rate feedback less
favorably, while non-native speakers write more positively but receive less
positive sentiment in return. When controlling for sex and age, significant
interactions emerge, suggesting that language background plays a modest but
complex role in shaping peer feedback experiences.

*Haoran Sun,Shaoning Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for Large Language Model Agents to improve structured memory organization and efficient retrieval, outperforming current methods on dialogue tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of memory integration in LLM Agents to improve reasoning, decision-making, and contextual coherence, targeting the limitations of existing memory mechanisms.

Method: It proposes Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM), which organizes memory in multiple levels of semantic abstraction and uses an index-based routing mechanism for layer-by-layer retrieval.

Result: Experimental results on the LoCoMo dataset reveal that H-MEM outperforms five baseline methods across five task settings, demonstrating higher efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: H-MEM successfully enhances long-term memory for LLM Agents, enabling better contextual coherence and decision-making in dialogue scenarios.

Abstract: Long-term memory is one of the key factors influencing the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents). Incorporating a
memory mechanism that effectively integrates past interactions can
significantly enhance decision-making and contextual coherence of LLM Agents.
While recent works have made progress in memory storage and retrieval, such as
encoding memory into dense vectors for similarity-based search or organizing
knowledge in the form of graph, these approaches often fall short in structured
memory organization and efficient retrieval. To address these limitations, we
propose a Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for LLM Agents that
organizes and updates memory in a multi-level fashion based on the degree of
semantic abstraction. Each memory vector is embedded with a positional index
encoding pointing to its semantically related sub-memories in the next layer.
During the reasoning phase, an index-based routing mechanism enables efficient,
layer-by-layer retrieval without performing exhaustive similarity computations.
We evaluate our method on five task settings from the LoCoMo dataset.
Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms five
baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-term dialogue
scenarios.

### [39] [Multi-Relation Extraction in Entity Pairs using Global Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22926)
*Nilesh,Atul Gupta,Avinash C Panday*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel encoding method for improved document-level relation extraction by capturing the global context of entities across sentences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods failed to adequately capture global context, focusing only on sentences where entities appear, thus hindering accurate relationship predictions in document-level relation extraction.

Method: The paper introduces an innovative input embedding that represents entities as independent segments, capturing their positions and relationships throughout the document for better global context and multi-sentence reasoning.

Result: The proposed method was evaluated using three datasets—DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL—showing improved relationship prediction accuracy in document-level settings.

Conclusion: This research enhances both theoretical understanding of global context modeling and practical relation extraction performance, making it valuable for complex NLP tasks requiring entity-level insights.

Abstract: In document-level relation extraction, entities may appear multiple times in
a document, and their relationships can shift from one context to another.
Accurate prediction of the relationship between two entities across an entire
document requires building a global context spanning all relevant sentences.
Previous approaches have focused only on the sentences where entities are
mentioned, which fails to capture the complete document context necessary for
accurate relation extraction. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel input
embedding approach to capture the positions of mentioned entities throughout
the document rather than focusing solely on the span where they appear. The
proposed input encoding approach leverages global relationships and
multi-sentence reasoning by representing entities as standalone segments,
independent of their positions within the document. The performance of the
proposed method has been tested on three benchmark relation extraction
datasets, namely DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL. The experimental results
demonstrated that the proposed method accurately predicts relationships between
entities in a document-level setting. The proposed research also has
theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it advances global
context modeling and multi-sentence reasoning in document-level relation
extraction. Practically, it enhances relationship detection, enabling improved
performance in real-world NLP applications requiring comprehensive entity-level
insights and interpretability.

*Zhehao Tan,Yihan Jiao,Dan Yang,Lei Liu,Jie Feng,Duolin Sun,Yue Shen,Jian Wang,Peng Wei,Jinjie Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new benchmark, Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark, is introduced to evaluate large language models' (LLMs) specific capabilities in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), focusing more on fine-grained tasks beyond overall system performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for RAG systems do not systematically evaluate the specific abilities of LLMs in document utilization, often focusing on general aspects like noise robustness.

Method: The authors propose Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark, which assesses LLMs across progressive dimensions—multi-level filtering, combination abilities, and reference reasoning—using a placeholder-based approach to separate parametric and external knowledge.

Result: Experiments reveal limitations in LLM capabilities within RAG systems in terms of error resilience and context faithfulness, highlighting areas for improvement.

Conclusion: Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark offers a reproducible framework for enhancing the reliability and efficiency of RAG systems, emphasizing nuanced evaluations. Code is made publicly available for further development.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge, where the LLM's ability to generate responses
based on the combination of a given query and retrieved documents is crucial.
However, most benchmarks focus on overall RAG system performance, rarely
assessing LLM-specific capabilities. Current benchmarks emphasize broad aspects
such as noise robustness, but lack a systematic and granular evaluation
framework on document utilization. To this end, we introduce
\textit{Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark}, a multi-level fine-grained benchmark,
emphasizing the following progressive dimensions: (1) multi-level filtering
abilities, (2) combination abilities, and (3) reference reasoning. To provide a
more nuanced understanding of LLMs' roles in RAG systems, we formulate an
innovative placeholder-based approach to decouple the contributions of the
LLM's parametric knowledge and the external knowledge. Experiments demonstrate
the limitations of representative LLMs in the RAG system's generation
capabilities, particularly in error resilience and context faithfulness. Our
benchmark provides a reproducible framework for developing more reliable and
efficient RAG systems. Our code is available in

*Xi Chen,Aske Plaat,Niki van Stein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting in Large Language Models, showing it improves reasoning in larger models (e.g., Pythia-2.8B) through more interpretable and modular computation, while having weaker effects in smaller models (e.g., Pythia-70M).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore whether CoT prompting generates faithful internal reasoning processes in large language models and understand its impact, interpretability, and functional mechanisms.

Method: Using sparse autoencoders and activation patching, the authors analyze monosemantic features extracted from LLMs prompted with CoT and noCoT. Comparisons are made between two models (Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B) solving math problems (GSM8K dataset).

Result: Swapping CoT features into noCoT runs significantly boosts log-probabilities for correct answers in Pythia-2.8B but not Pythia-70M. CoT also increases feature interpretability and sparsity, with improved confidence scores in larger models (e.g., 1.2 to 4.3).

Conclusion: CoT prompting enhances reasoning and induces interpretable modular structures in large-scale models, validating its efficacy as a structured prompting method.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting boosts Large Language Models accuracy on
multi-step tasks, yet whether the generated "thoughts" reflect the true
internal reasoning process is unresolved. We present the first feature-level
causal study of CoT faithfulness. Combining sparse autoencoders with activation
patching, we extract monosemantic features from Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B
while they tackle GSM8K math problems under CoT and plain (noCoT) prompting.
Swapping a small set of CoT-reasoning features into a noCoT run raises answer
log-probabilities significantly in the 2.8B model, but has no reliable effect
in 70M, revealing a clear scale threshold. CoT also leads to significantly
higher activation sparsity and feature interpretability scores in the larger
model, signalling more modular internal computation. For example, the model's
confidence in generating correct answers improves from 1.2 to 4.3. We introduce
patch-curves and random-feature patching baselines, showing that useful CoT
information is not only present in the top-K patches but widely distributed.
Overall, our results indicate that CoT can induce more interpretable internal
structures in high-capacity LLMs, validating its role as a structured prompting
method.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) designed for ophthalmic diagnosis face challenges due to hallucinations caused by limited knowledge, visual reasoning, and data scarcity. The paper introduces EH-Benchmark to evaluate and mitigate these hallucinations through a novel agent-centric framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of MLLMs in ophthalmic diagnosis, such as hallucinations, inaccurate lesion detection, and inadequate evaluation benchmarks.

Method: The study proposes EH-Benchmark, a categorization of hallucinations into Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, alongside a multi-agent framework with three phases: Knowledge-Level Retrieval, Task-Level Case Studies, and Result-Level Validation.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the multi-agent framework effectively reduces hallucinations, improving MLLMs' accuracy, interpretability, and reliability in ophthalmic diagnosis.

Conclusion: The proposed EH-Benchmark and multi-agent framework significantly advance the evaluation and mitigation of hallucinations in MLLMs, paving the way for more reliable ophthalmic diagnosis systems.

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our
project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to create synthetic datasets mimicking personally identifiable information (PII)-revealing posts on Reddit while maintaining privacy and safety, releasing both the dataset and the methodology for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the privacy risks associated with PII disclosures on social media platforms like Reddit. It highlights the lack of labeled datasets for studying and mitigating these risks, thereby motivating the need for a reproducible and shareable synthetic dataset combining privacy and usability.

Method: The authors developed a methodology to create synthetic data resembling PII-revealing Reddit posts using three large language models (LLMs): Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, and zephyr-7b-beta. The process involves sequential instruction-based text generation and categorization into 19 PII types.

Result: The synthetic dataset was evaluated using three criteria: reproducibility equivalence (comparable model training results on synthetic and real data), unlinkability (no traceability of synthetic data to original users), and indistinguishability (difficulty in identifying synthetic versus real data by trained humans). The results validated the dataset according to these metrics.

Conclusion: The research provides a validated synthetic PII-revealing dataset and an open methodology, enabling reproducible studies into privacy risks and mitigation strategies for self-disclosures on social media. The dataset and code are made available for community usage.

Abstract: Social platforms such as Reddit have a network of communities of shared
interests, with a prevalence of posts and comments from which one can infer
users' Personal Information Identifiers (PIIs). While such self-disclosures can
lead to rewarding social interactions, they pose privacy risks and the threat
of online harms. Research into the identification and retrieval of such risky
self-disclosures of PIIs is hampered by the lack of open-source labeled
datasets. To foster reproducible research into PII-revealing text detection, we
develop a novel methodology to create synthetic equivalents of PII-revealing
data that can be safely shared. Our contributions include creating a taxonomy
of 19 PII-revealing categories for vulnerable populations and the creation and
release of a synthetic PII-labeled multi-text span dataset generated from 3
text generation Large Language Models (LLMs), Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, and
zephyr-7b-beta, with sequential instruction prompting to resemble the original
Reddit posts. The utility of our methodology to generate this synthetic dataset
is evaluated with three metrics: First, we require reproducibility equivalence,
i.e., results from training a model on the synthetic data should be comparable
to those obtained by training the same models on the original posts. Second, we
require that the synthetic data be unlinkable to the original users, through
common mechanisms such as Google Search. Third, we wish to ensure that the
synthetic data be indistinguishable from the original, i.e., trained humans
should not be able to tell them apart. We release our dataset and code at
https://netsys.surrey.ac.uk/datasets/synthetic-self-disclosure/ to foster
reproducible research into PII privacy risks in online social media.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations in ontology matching tasks; this paper introduces a benchmark dataset, OAEI-LLM-T, to categorize and analyze these hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the common issue of hallucinations in LLM-based ontology matching systems by providing a structured benchmark dataset to evaluate and improve their performance.

Method: The authors developed the OAEI-LLM-T dataset from seven TBox datasets of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI), organizing hallucinations into two primary categories and six subcategories.

Result: OAEI-LLM-T was used to identify hallucination patterns in ten different LLMs, contributing to the creation of an LLM leaderboard for ontology matching tasks and aiding in fine-tuning LLMs specific to such tasks.

Conclusion: The dataset serves as a valuable tool for diagnosing and mitigating LLM hallucinations in ontology matching, offering a structured approach to enhance the reliability of LLMs in this domain.

Abstract: Hallucinations are often inevitable in downstream tasks using large language
models (LLMs). To tackle the substantial challenge of addressing hallucinations
for LLM-based ontology matching (OM) systems, we introduce a new benchmark
dataset OAEI-LLM-T. The dataset evolves from seven TBox datasets in the
Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI), capturing hallucinations of
ten different LLMs performing OM tasks. These OM-specific hallucinations are
organised into two primary categories and six sub-categories. We showcase the
usefulness of the dataset in constructing an LLM leaderboard for OM tasks and
for fine-tuning LLMs used in OM tasks.

### [45] [Enhancing RAG Efficiency with Adaptive Context Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22931)
*Shuyu Guo,Zhaochun Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ACC-RAG is a framework for Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that dynamically adjusts context compression rates based on query complexity, improving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in inference costs for RAG caused by fixed-rate context compression, which poorly handles differing complexities of input queries.

Method: ACC-RAG uses a hierarchical compressor for multi-granular embeddings, combined with a context selector to retain essential information, adjusting compression rates dynamically based on input complexity.

Result: ACC-RAG demonstrated superior performance to fixed-rate methods and achieved over 4 times faster inference while maintaining or improving accuracy during evaluations on Wikipedia and five QA datasets.

Conclusion: Dynamic context compression with ACC-RAG optimizes inference efficiency and accuracy for RAG, proving advantageous over fixed-rate methods.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy
retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing
methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or
under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG
(ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on
input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with
a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human
skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms
fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus
standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper explores improvements to visual-language machine learning by integrating neural-symbolic systems for reasoning, memory, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in visual-language models, including explainability, adaptability, and logical reasoning.

Method: Perform a systematic literature review categorizing techniques that combine visual-language models with symbolic information systems.

Result: Categorizes and analyzes techniques for neural-symbolic integration to enhance visual-language systems.

Conclusion: Neural-symbolic systems can improve reasoning, memory, adaptability, and provide interpretable explanations in visual-language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual-language machine learning models have demonstrated
exceptional ability to use natural language and understand visual scenes by
training on large, unstructured datasets. However, this training paradigm
cannot produce interpretable explanations for its outputs, requires retraining
to integrate new information, is highly resource-intensive, and struggles with
certain forms of logical reasoning. One promising solution involves integrating
neural networks with external symbolic information systems, forming neural
symbolic systems that can enhance reasoning and memory abilities. These neural
symbolic systems provide more interpretable explanations to their outputs and
the capacity to assimilate new information without extensive retraining.
Utilizing powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as the core neural
component, augmented by external systems, offers a pragmatic approach to
realizing the benefits of neural-symbolic integration. This systematic
literature review aims to categorize techniques through which visual-language
understanding can be improved by interacting with external symbolic information
systems.

Abstract: Deriving operational intelligence from organizational data repositories is a
key challenge due to the dichotomy of data confidentiality vs data integration
objectives, as well as the limitations of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools relative to the specific knowledge structure of domains such as
operations and maintenance. In this work, we discuss Knowledge Graph
construction and break down the Knowledge Extraction process into its Named
Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Named Entity Linking, and Relation
Extraction functional components. We then evaluate sixteen NLP tools in concert
with or in comparison to the rapidly advancing capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). We focus on the operational and maintenance intelligence use
case for trusted applications in the aircraft industry. A baseline dataset is
derived from a rich public domain US Federal Aviation Administration dataset
focused on equipment failures or maintenance requirements. We assess the
zero-shot performance of NLP and LLM tools that can be operated within a
controlled, confidential environment (no data is sent to third parties). Based
on our observation of significant performance limitations, we discuss the
challenges related to trusted NLP and LLM tools as well as their Technical
Readiness Level for wider use in mission-critical industries such as aviation.

*Md Talha Mohsin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates five LLMs (GPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, DeepSeek) on FinNLP tasks using 10-K filings. Results favor GPT, followed by Claude and Perplexity, showing variability across datasets and over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic comparison among LLMs in financial analysis tasks remains largely unexplored despite their rapid advancements.

Method: A comparative evaluation is conducted employing domain-specific prompts and three methodologies: human annotation, lexical-semantic metrics (e.g., ROUGE, Cosine Similarity), and model behavior diagnostics.

Result: GPT performs best in coherence and relevancy, while Gemini and DeepSeek show higher variability. Performance fluctuates based on prompts and datasets.

Conclusion: GPT leads in FinNLP performance, but LLM outputs vary based on source material and prompt design, highlighting sensitivity in results.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide variety of Financial Natural Language Processing (FinNLP) tasks.
However, systematic comparisons among widely used LLMs remain underexplored.
Given the rapid advancement and growing influence of LLMs in financial
analysis, this study conducts a thorough comparative evaluation of five leading
LLMs, GPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini and DeepSeek, using 10-K filings from the
'Magnificent Seven' technology companies. We create a set of domain-specific
prompts and then use three methodologies to evaluate model performance: human
annotation, automated lexical-semantic metrics (ROUGE, Cosine Similarity,
Jaccard), and model behavior diagnostics (prompt-level variance and
across-model similarity). The results show that GPT gives the most coherent,
semantically aligned, and contextually relevant answers; followed by Claude and
Perplexity. Gemini and DeepSeek, on the other hand, have more variability and
less agreement. Also, the similarity and stability of outputs change from
company to company and over time, showing that they are sensitive to how
prompts are written and what source material is used.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoE-Ops, a collaboration-of-expert framework using large language models to address diverse AIOps tasks, achieving significant accuracy improvements compared to other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of domain-specific single models and demonstrate the efficiency of combining multiple models for improved AIOps performance.

Method: The paper proposes CoE-Ops framework that incorporates a large language model task classifier and introduces retrieval-augmented generation for better handling various DevOps tasks.

Result: CoE-Ops improves routing accuracy by 72% for high-level tasks, enhances problem resolution by 8% over single models, and outperforms larger-scale MoE models by 14%.

Conclusion: The CoE-Ops framework successfully addresses challenges in AIOps and significantly improves task efficiency and accuracy in diverse scenarios, showcasing the strength of combining AI models.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, AIOps has emerged as a
prominent paradigm in DevOps. Lots of work has been proposed to improve the
performance of different AIOps phases. However, constrained by domain-specific
knowledge, a single model can only handle the operation requirement of a
specific task,such as log parser,root cause analysis. Meanwhile, combining
multiple models can achieve more efficient results, which have been proved in
both previous ensemble learning and the recent LLM training domain. Inspired by
these works,to address the similar challenges in AIOPS, this paper first
proposes a collaboration-of-expert framework(CoE-Ops) incorporating a
general-purpose large language model task classifier. A retrieval-augmented
generation mechanism is introduced to improve the framework's capability in
handling both Question-Answering tasks with high-level(Code,build,Test,etc.)
and low-level(fault analysis,anomaly detection,etc.). Finally, the proposed
method is implemented in the AIOps domain, and extensive experiments are
conducted on the DevOps-EVAL dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
CoE-Ops achieves a 72% improvement in routing accuracy for high-level AIOps
tasks compared to existing CoE methods, delivers up to 8% accuracy enhancement
over single AIOps models in DevOps problem resolution, and outperforms
larger-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by up to 14% in accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach for answering questions from flowchart-based figures by integrating Visual Language Models (VLMs) with text-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current QA systems struggle to find answers hidden within technical flowcharts, prompting the need for more specialized and robust methods.

Method: The authors combined graph representations of flowcharts derived from fine-tuned Visual Language Models (VLMs) into a text-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline while benchmarking performance on a telecom-specific dataset.

Result: Graph representations obtained through the proposed method exhibited lower edit distances from ground truths, and the QA system demonstrated high retrieval performance even after telecom-domain adaptations.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances QA from technical flowchart images, mitigates reliance on VLMs during inference, and provides financial benefits for system deployment.

Abstract: Question-Answering (QA) from technical documents often involves questions
whose answers are present in figures, such as flowcharts or flow diagrams.
Text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems may fail to answer such
questions. We leverage graph representations of flowcharts obtained from Visual
large Language Models (VLMs) and incorporate them in a text-based RAG system to
show that this approach can enable image retrieval for QA in the telecom
domain. We present the end-to-end approach from processing technical documents,
classifying image types, building graph representations, and incorporating them
with the text embedding pipeline for efficient retrieval. We benchmark the same
on a QA dataset created based on proprietary telecom product information
documents. Results show that the graph representations obtained using a
fine-tuned VLM model have lower edit distance with respect to the ground truth,
which illustrate the robustness of these representations for flowchart images.
Further, the approach for QA using these representations gives good retrieval
performance using text-based embedding models, including a telecom-domain
adapted one. Our approach also alleviates the need for a VLM in inference,
which is an important cost benefit for deployed QA systems.

TL;DR: RELIANCE improves the factual accuracy of reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing issues of incorrect reasoning despite correct final answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the risks of incorrect reasoning steps within LLMs in sensitive domains such as healthcare and law, which can lead to harmful decisions.

Method: RELIANCE uses a fact-checking classifier, Group Relative Policy Optimization for reinforcement learning, and an interpretability module to improve reasoning factuality.

Result: Evaluations show the framework improves factual robustness by up to 49.90% and performs well on benchmarks like Math-500 and GPQA.

Conclusion: RELIANCE enhances reasoning factuality and provides insights for more robust training methodologies, ensuring safer use of LLMs in critical applications.

Abstract: We present RELIANCE (Reasoning Evaluation with Logical Integrity and Accuracy
for Confidence Enhancement), a novel framework addressing a critical
vulnerability in Large Language Models (LLMs): the prevalence of factual
inaccuracies within intermediate reasoning steps despite correct final answers.
This phenomenon poses substantial risks in high-stakes domains including
healthcare, legal analysis, and scientific research, where erroneous yet
confidently presented reasoning can mislead users into dangerous decisions. Our
framework integrates three core components: (1) a specialized fact-checking
classifier trained on counterfactually augmented data to detect subtle factual
inconsistencies within reasoning chains; (2) a Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning approach that balances factuality,
coherence, and structural correctness through multi-dimensional rewards; and
(3) a mechanistic interpretability module examining how factuality improvements
manifest in model activations during reasoning processes. Extensive evaluation
across ten state-of-the-art models reveals concerning patterns: even leading
models like Claude-3.7 and GPT-o1 demonstrate reasoning factual accuracy of
only 81.93% and 82.57% respectively. RELIANCE significantly enhances factual
robustness (up to 49.90% improvement) while maintaining or improving
performance on challenging benchmarks including Math-500, AIME-2024, and GPQA.
Furthermore, our activation-level analysis provides actionable insights into
how factual enhancements reshape reasoning trajectories within model
architectures, establishing foundations for future training methodologies that
explicitly target factual robustness through activation-guided optimization.

TL;DR: The paper proposes SigBERT, a framework leveraging rough path theory and word embeddings to process sequential medical reports for improved survival analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing survival analysis methods struggle with the complexity of textual and temporal medical data.

Method: SigBERT extracts sentence embeddings from textual medical data and uses signature features from rough path theory paired with a LASSO-penalized Cox model.

Result: SigBERT achieves a C-index of 0.75 (sd 0.014) on oncology data, showcasing improved survival model performance.

Conclusion: SigBERT efficiently integrates temporal medical data for enhanced risk estimation in survival analysis, marking progress in handling sequential medical data.

Abstract: Electronic medical reports (EHR) contain a vast amount of information that
can be leveraged for machine learning applications in healthcare. However,
existing survival analysis methods often struggle to effectively handle the
complexity of textual data, particularly in its sequential form. Here, we
propose SigBERT, an innovative temporal survival analysis framework designed to
efficiently process a large number of clinical reports per patient. SigBERT
processes timestamped medical reports by extracting and averaging word
embeddings into sentence embeddings. To capture temporal dynamics from the time
series of sentence embedding coordinates, we apply signature extraction from
rough path theory to derive geometric features for each patient, which
significantly enhance survival model performance by capturing complex temporal
dynamics. These features are then integrated into a LASSO-penalized Cox model
to estimate patient-specific risk scores. The model was trained and evaluated
on a real-world oncology dataset from the L\'eon B\'erard Center corpus, with a
C-index score of 0.75 (sd 0.014) on the independent test cohort. SigBERT
integrates sequential medical data to enhance risk estimation, advancing
narrative-based survival analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a process using NLP and adaptive sampling to enhance validation efficiency for claims-based algorithms, reducing manual effort and improving study precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Validation of code-based algorithms in healthcare studies often requires significant manual effort to assess measurement characteristics, resulting in high resource investment.

Method: The study employs natural language processing (NLP) to minimize human chart review time and introduces adaptive sampling with stopping criteria for efficient validation.

Result: NLP reduced chart review time by 40%, and the sampling method prevented the review of 77% of charts, maintaining precision in performance metrics.

Conclusion: This approach can streamline validation for code-based algorithms, potentially improving the reliability of database study findings.

Abstract: Background: One of the ways to enhance analyses conducted with large claims
databases is by validating the measurement characteristics of code-based
algorithms used to identify health outcomes or other key study parameters of
interest. These metrics can be used in quantitative bias analyses to assess the
robustness of results for an inferential study given potential bias from
outcome misclassification. However, extensive time and resource allocation are
typically re-quired to create reference-standard labels through manual chart
review of free-text notes from linked electronic health records. Methods: We
describe an expedited process that introduces efficiency in a validation study
us-ing two distinct mechanisms: 1) use of natural language processing (NLP) to
reduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and 2) a multi-wave
adaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation
study once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient
precision. We illustrate this process in a case study that validates the
performance of a claims-based outcome algorithm for intentional self-harm in
patients with obesity. Results: We empirically demonstrate that the
NLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by
40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have
prevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision
in derived measurement characteristics. Conclusion: This approach could
facilitate more routine validation of code-based algorithms used to define key
study parameters, ultimately enhancing understanding of the reliability of
find-ings derived from database studies.

Motivation: To challenge traditional views of arbitrariness as injustice and explore it as a functional trait essential to human systems.

Method: The authors build on Saussure's concept of linguistic arbitrariness, extend it across domains, introduce a chain model (Motivation -> Constatability -> Contestability), and apply Shannon's entropy model to formalize arbitrariness.

Result: Arbitrariness is formalized using entropy and analyzed as a key operator in authority, accountability, and relational care, offering insights into human systems and AI explainability.

Conclusion: Arbitrariness, rather than a flaw, is revealed as a structural feature essential for preserving authority, operational efficiency, and fostering a balance between control and care within systems.

Abstract: This article redefines arbitrariness not as a normative flaw or a symptom of
domination, but as a foundational functional mechanism structuring human
systems and interactions. Diverging from critical traditions that conflate
arbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a
property enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate
effectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand
de Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this
principle beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,
particularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the "Motivation
-> Constatability -> Contestability" chain, arguing that motivation functions
as a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective
contestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like
"immotivization" or "Conflict Lateralization" (exemplified by "the blur of the
wolf drowned in the fish"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their
rationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while
appearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from
accountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes
arbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern
theory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as
care, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily
developed through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new
pathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence
systems.

### [58] [C3: A Bilingual Benchmark for Spoken Dialogue Models Exploring Challenges in Complex Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22968)
*Chengqian Ma,Wei Tao,Yiwen Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark dataset to evaluate Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) and their ability to handle challenges in understanding and generating human-like spoken dialogue, such as ambiguity and context-dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the lack of comprehensive benchmarks evaluating how well SDMs understand and emulate human conversational dynamics, as compared to text-based models.

Method: The authors present a benchmark dataset consisting of 1,079 instances in English and Chinese and propose an LLM-based evaluation method that aligns with human judgment.

Result: The paper offers tools to analyze SDMs' effectiveness in handling challenges specific to spoken dialogue, such as ambiguity and context-dependency.

Conclusion: This study highlights the need for better evaluation standards for SDMs and provides resources to facilitate advancements in the domain.

Abstract: Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have recently attracted significant attention
for their ability to generate voice responses directly to users' spoken
queries. Despite their increasing popularity, there exists a gap in research
focused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in
comprehending and emulating human conversations. This is especially true
compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from
extensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex
than text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one
challenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as
phonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns.
Additionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn
interaction, adds further complexity to human conversational dynamics. To
illuminate the current state of SDM development and to address these
challenges, we present a benchmark dataset in this paper, which comprises 1,079
instances in English and Chinese. Accompanied by an LLM-based evaluation method
that closely aligns with human judgment, this dataset facilitates a
comprehensive exploration of the performance of SDMs in tackling these
practical challenges.

*Valeria de Paiva,Qiyue Gao,Hai Hu,Pavel Kovalev,Yikang Liu,Lawrence S. Moss,Zhiheng Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores whether contemporary large language models (LLMs) can perform natural language inference tasks on mathematical texts, called "Math NLI." A corpus of math-focused NLI pairs is developed and used to evaluate model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand the extent to which LLMs are capable of reasoning and drawing inferences from mathematical texts, addressing the gap in AI's understanding of specialized domains like mathematics.

Method: The researchers created a Math NLI dataset using mathematical texts as premises and human-generated hypotheses and gold labels. They evaluated the performance and consistency of various LLMs, additionally testing the quality of hypotheses generated by LLMs themselves.

Result: Key findings include that a majority vote across LLMs can approximate human-labeled data, though the models still face significant challenges with mathematical language and can fail basic inferences. Improvements over previous generations are observed, with less bias toward hypothesis-only inferences.

Conclusion: Contemporary LLMs show both potential and limitations in Math NLI tasks. While promising in some settings, their struggles with mathematical reasoning underscore the need for further advancements. The authors also released the dataset to foster future research in this area.

Abstract: We ask whether contemporary LLMs are able to perform natural language
inference (NLI) tasks on mathematical texts. We call this the Math NLI problem.
We construct a corpus of Math NLI pairs whose premises are from extant
mathematical text and whose hypotheses and gold labels were provided by people
with experience in both research-level mathematics and also in the NLI field.
We also investigate the quality of corpora using the same premises but whose
hypotheses are provided by LLMs themselves. We not only investigate the
performance but also the inter-group consistency of the diverse group of LLMs.
We have both positive and negative findings. Among our positive findings: in
some settings, using a majority vote of LLMs is approximately equivalent to
using human-labeled data in the Math NLI area. On the negative side: LLMs still
struggle with mathematical language. They occasionally fail at even basic
inferences. Current models are not as prone to hypothesis-only "inference" in
our data the way the previous generation had been. In addition to our findings,
we also provide our corpora as data to support future work on Math NLI.

### [60] [Exploring In-Context Learning for Frame-Semantic Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23082)
*Diego Garat,Guillermo Moncecchi,Dina Wonsever*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) for Frame Semantic Parsing without fine-tuning, achieving strong results using task-specific prompts generated from FrameNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for an effective approach to Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP) without requiring model fine-tuning, making it more practical for domain-specific FSP tasks.

Method: The authors develop a method that generates prompts using FrameNet definitions and examples to guide LLMs for Frame Identification and Frame Semantic Role Labeling.

Result: The proposed approach achieved competitive F1 scores of 94.3% for Frame Identification and 77.4% for Frame Semantic Role Labeling on frames related to violent events.

Conclusion: In-Context Learning with LLMs provides a practical, effective alternative to fine-tuning for Frame Semantic Parsing, particularly in domain-specific scenarios.

Abstract: Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP) entails identifying predicates and labeling
their arguments according to Frame Semantics. This paper investigates the use
of In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform FSP
without model fine-tuning. We propose a method that automatically generates
task-specific prompts for the Frame Identification (FI) and Frame Semantic Role
Labeling (FSRL) subtasks, relying solely on the FrameNet database. These
prompts, constructed from frame definitions and annotated examples, are used to
guide six different LLMs. Experiments are conducted on a subset of frames
related to violent events. The method achieves competitive results, with F1
scores of 94.3% for FI and 77.4% for FSRL. The findings suggest that ICL offers
a practical and effective alternative to traditional fine-tuning for
domain-specific FSP tasks.

*Ali Veisi,Delaram Fartoot,Hamidreza Amirzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CARoPE (Context-Aware Rotary Positional Embedding), improving on RoPE by allowing context- and token-sensitive positional embeddings, achieving better performance and faster training in Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE's static, input-independent frequency patterns limit its ability to model context-sensitive relationships in Transformer models.

Method: CARoPE dynamically generates head-specific frequency patterns using token embeddings to introduce context- and token-sensitive positional representations while maintaining RoPE's efficiency.

Result: CARoPE exhibited significantly lower perplexity compared to RoPE and other positional baselines in next-token prediction tasks, particularly at longer context lengths, while also enabling faster training throughput.

Conclusion: CARoPE demonstrates itself as a scalable, expressive, and efficient improvement to traditional positional encoding techniques in Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Positional encoding is a vital component of Transformer architectures,
enabling models to incorporate sequence order into self-attention mechanisms.
Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have become a widely adopted solution due
to their compatibility with relative position encoding and computational
efficiency. However, RoPE relies on static, input-independent sinusoidal
frequency patterns, limiting its ability to model context-sensitive
relationships. In this work, we propose CARoPE (Context-Aware Rotary Positional
Embedding), a novel generalization of RoPE that dynamically generates
head-specific frequency patterns conditioned on token embeddings. This design
introduces token- and context-sensitive positional representations while
preserving RoPE efficiency and architectural simplicity. CARoPE computes
input-dependent phase shifts using a bounded transformation of token embeddings
and integrates them into the rotary mechanism across attention heads. We
evaluate CARoPE on the FineWeb-Edu-10B dataset using GPT-2 variants trained on
next-token prediction tasks. Experimental results show that CARoPE consistently
outperforms RoPE and other common positional encoding baselines, achieving
significantly lower perplexity, even at longer context lengths. Additionally,
CARoPE enables faster training throughput without sacrificing model stability.
These findings demonstrate that CARoPE offers a scalable, expressive, and
efficient upgrade to existing positional encoding strategies in Transformer
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SMART-Editor is a new editing framework that enhances layout and content coherence in structured and unstructured domains, outperforming baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of maintaining global coherence in compositional editing tasks across structured and unstructured domains.

Method: Introduced two strategies: Reward-Refine (inference-time reward-guided refinement) and RewardDPO (training-time preference optimization using reward-aligned pairs). Benchmarking was done with SMARTEdit-Bench.

Result: SMART-Editor demonstrated superior performance compared to baselines like InstructPix2Pix and HIVE, with RewardDPO providing significant gains in structured domains and Reward-Refine excelling in natural image editing.

Conclusion: Reward-guided planning is effective in ensuring semantically consistent and visually aligned edits. SMART-Editor establishes itself as a leading framework in the domain.

Abstract: We present SMART-Editor, a framework for compositional layout and content
editing across structured (posters, websites) and unstructured (natural images)
domains. Unlike prior models that perform local edits, SMART-Editor preserves
global coherence through two strategies: Reward-Refine, an inference-time
rewardguided refinement method, and RewardDPO, a training-time preference
optimization approach using reward-aligned layout pairs. To evaluate model
performance, we introduce SMARTEdit-Bench, a benchmark covering multi-domain,
cascading edit scenarios. SMART-Editor outperforms strong baselines like
InstructPix2Pix and HIVE, with RewardDPO achieving up to 15% gains in
structured settings and Reward-Refine showing advantages on natural images.
Automatic and human evaluations confirm the value of reward-guided planning in
producing semantically consistent and visually aligned edits.

*Jeffrey Eben,Aitzaz Ahmad,Stephen Lau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study presents a scalable architecture for handling large enterprise-level databases using natural language interfaces without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the scalability challenges in natural language interfaces for enterprise-level databases, especially those that require significant metadata indexing and efficient retrieval.

Method: The authors propose a component-based retrieval system that breaks database schemas and metadata into discrete semantic units for better indexing and targeted retrieval. This prioritizes table identification and column-level details while maintaining a manageable context budget.

Result: The proposed solution demonstrates high recall and accuracy in experiments, outperforming baseline methods in large and diverse database environments.

Conclusion: This method offers a scalable and deployable text-to-SQL solution for enterprise data catalogs, eliminating the need for specialized fine-tuning and leveraging database metadata effectively.

Abstract: Despite advances in large language model (LLM)-based natural language
interfaces for databases, scaling to enterprise-level data catalogs remains an
under-explored challenge. Prior works addressing this challenge rely on
domain-specific fine-tuning - complicating deployment - and fail to leverage
important semantic context contained within database metadata. To address these
limitations, we introduce a component-based retrieval architecture that
decomposes database schemas and metadata into discrete semantic units, each
separately indexed for targeted retrieval. Our approach prioritizes effective
table identification while leveraging column-level information, ensuring the
total number of retrieved tables remains within a manageable context budget.
Experiments demonstrate that our method maintains high recall and accuracy,
with our system outperforming baselines over massive databases with varying
structure and available metadata. Our solution enables practical text-to-SQL
systems deployable across diverse enterprise settings without specialized
fine-tuning, addressing a critical scalability gap in natural language database
interfaces.

*Xinwei Wu,Haojie Li,Hongyu Liu,Xinyu Ji,Ruohan Li,Yule Chen,Yigeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how large language models (LLMs) handle linguistic ambiguity in Chinese, identifying critical limitations and suggesting the need for improved methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the critical issue of trustworthiness in LLMs, specifically focusing on how they deal with linguistic ambiguity, particularly in Chinese texts.

Method: A benchmark dataset of ambiguous sentences along with their disambiguated pairs was created, categorized into 3 main and 9 subcategories. Experimental analysis was conducted to evaluate LLMs' performance.

Result: Experiments revealed significant limitations: LLMs struggle to distinguish ambiguous from unambiguous text, are overconfident in assigning a single meaning to ambiguous sentences, and show overthinking when interpreting multiple meanings.

Conclusion: The findings suggest a fundamental limitation of LLMs in dealing with linguistic ambiguity, encouraging the development of improved strategies for uncertainty in language understanding. Dataset and code are made publicly available for further use.

Abstract: In this work, we study a critical research problem regarding the
trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs): how LLMs behave when
encountering ambiguous narrative text, with a particular focus on Chinese
textual ambiguity. We created a benchmark dataset by collecting and generating
ambiguous sentences with context and their corresponding disambiguated pairs,
representing multiple possible interpretations. These annotated examples are
systematically categorized into 3 main categories and 9 subcategories. Through
experiments, we discovered significant fragility in LLMs when handling
ambiguity, revealing behavior that differs substantially from humans.
Specifically, LLMs cannot reliably distinguish ambiguous text from unambiguous
text, show overconfidence in interpreting ambiguous text as having a single
meaning rather than multiple meanings, and exhibit overthinking when attempting
to understand the various possible meanings. Our findings highlight a
fundamental limitation in current LLMs that has significant implications for
their deployment in real-world applications where linguistic ambiguity is
common, calling for improved approaches to handle uncertainty in language
understanding. The dataset and code are publicly available at this GitHub

*Ananya Sadana,Yash Kumar Lal,Jiawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ISO-Bench to evaluate if multimodal models can infer causal order between images and text, showing existing models perform poorly compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding causal relationships across modalities in multimodal models when interacting with real-world environments.

Method: They created ISO-Bench, a benchmark involving tasks where models decide the order (before or after) between a task step's image and related procedural text, and tested existing state-of-the-art vision-language models under this benchmark.

Result: Models achieved low performance, with the best zero-shot F1 at 0.57 and a marginal improvement to 0.62 F1 with chain-of-thought reasoning, falling significantly short of human performance (F1 0.98).

Conclusion: Current vision-language models lack sufficient causal understanding across modalities, and the study identifies specific directions to improve this capability in such models.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships across modalities is a core challenge for
multimodal models operating in real-world environments. We introduce ISO-Bench,
a benchmark for evaluating whether models can infer causal dependencies between
visual observations and procedural text. Each example presents an image of a
task step and a text snippet from a plan, with the goal of deciding whether the
visual step occurs before or after the referenced text step. Evaluation results
on ten frontier vision-language models show underwhelming performance: the best
zero-shot F1 is only 0.57, and chain-of-thought reasoning yields only modest
gains (up to 0.62 F1), largely behind humans (0.98 F1). Our analysis further
highlights concrete directions for improving causal understanding in multimodal
models.

*Yuhan Liu,Michael J. Q. Zhang,Eunsol Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates harvesting and utilizing implicit user feedback from interactions with language models, exploring its insights, benefits, and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable language models to improve over time through continuous interaction and feedback without requiring disruptive direct feedback from users.

Method: Analyzed two user-LM interaction datasets to study implicit feedback patterns, and assessed their utility in improving performance for questions of varying complexity.

Result: Implicit user feedback enhanced model performance on short, human-designed questions but had limitations with longer, complex queries. Feedback's value largely depends on initial prompt quality.

Conclusion: Implicit user feedback has the potential for improving model performance, but its effectiveness varies based on content, question complexity, and input prompt quality.

Abstract: Once language models (LMs) are deployed, they can interact with users
long-term, ideally evolving continuously based on their feedback. Asking for
direct user feedback can be disruptive; thus, we study harvesting user feedback
from user-LM interaction logs. We study implicit user feedback in two user-LM
interaction datasets (WildChat and LMSYS). First, we analyze user feedback in
the user-LLM conversation trajectory, providing insights into when and why such
feedback occurs. Second, we study harvesting learning signals from such
implicit user feedback. We find that the contents of user feedback (e.g., user
wanted clarification), not just the polarity (e.g., users were unhappy with the
previous model response), can improve model performance in short human-designed
questions (MTBench) but not on longer and more complex questions (WildBench).
We also find that the usefulness of user feedback is largely tied to the
quality of the user's initial prompt. Together, we provide an in-depth study of
implicit user feedback, showing its potential and limitations.

### [67] [LENS: Learning Ensemble Confidence from Neural States for Multi-LLM Answer Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23167)
*Jizhou Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces LENS, a novel method for ensemble confidence estimation by analyzing internal representations of Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving superior results compared to traditional ensemble techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel in different domains and abilities, but current ensemble methods like voting fail to account for varying model confidence. The aim is to improve ensemble robustness and performance using more context-aware methods.

Method: The LENS approach trains lightweight linear confidence predictors using layer-wise hidden states and normalized probabilities from LLMs. This method estimates confidence without altering model parameters and with minimal computation.

Result: Experimental evaluation on multiple-choice and boolean question-answering tasks shows LENS significantly outperforms traditional ensemble methods by leveraging internal representations.

Conclusion: LENS demonstrates that internal representations provide valuable signals for confidence estimation, advancing ensemble methods for LLMs and improving context-sensitive robustness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, with different models excelling in distinct domains and specific
abilities. Effectively combining the predictions of multiple LLMs is crucial
for enhancing system robustness and performance. However, existing ensemble
methods often rely on simple techniques like voting or logits ensembling, which
overlook the varying confidence and reliability of models in different
contexts. In this work, we propose LENS (Learning ENsemble confidence from
Neural States), a novel approach that learns to estimate model confidence by
analyzing internal representations. For each LLM, we train a lightweight linear
confidence predictor that leverages layer-wise hidden states and normalized
probabilities as inputs. This allows for more nuanced weighting of model
predictions based on their context-dependent reliability. Our method does not
require modifying the model parameters and requires negligible additional
computation. Experimental results on multiple-choice and boolean
question-answering tasks demonstrate that LENS outperforms traditional ensemble
methods by a substantial margin. Our findings suggest that internal
representations provide valuable signals for determining model confidence and
can be effectively leveraged for ensemble learning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI-driven GPU kernel generation is advancing to streamline optimization and maximize performance, particularly via Triton language and the GEAK framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing complexity of deep learning workloads necessitates automating GPU kernel development to enhance performance and productivity.

Method: The proposed GEAK framework uses advanced LLMs and Reflexion-style feedback to generate Triton-based GPU kernels optimized for AMD GPUs.

Result: GEAK achieved correctness rates of 63% and execution speeds up to 2.59X compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: GEAK framework demonstrates significant potential for simplifying GPU programming while optimizing performance across diverse hardware platforms.

Abstract: The demand for AI-generated GPU kernels is rapidly growing, influenced by the
need for scalable, hardware-optimized solutions in both industry and academia.
As deep learning workloads grow in complexity and diversity, it is imperative
to automate low-level kernel development to meet performance and productivity
demands. Major cloud providers, semiconductor companies, and research
institutions are now investing heavily in AI-driven code generation for GPUs,
aiming to reduce manual optimization efforts while achieving near-expert
performance on hardware like AMD MI300X. The Triton language, a Python-based
DSL for GPU programming, has emerged as a popular target for such AI-generated
kernels due to its balance of performance and ease-of-coding. In this work, we
present an evaluation suite for Triton-based GPU kernels and GEAK (Generating
Efficient AI-centric GPU Kernels)-a framework that leverages cutting-edge LLMs
to generate performant Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, including the AMD
MI300X and MI250. GEAK leverages inference-time compute scaling to produce
Triton-based GPU kernels using a reasoning loop adapted from Reflexion-style
feedback mechanisms. On two evaluation benchmarks, GEAK significantly
outperformed the baselines of directly prompting frontier LLMs as well as
Reflexion-based generation pipelines by achieving correctness up to $63$% and
execution speed up of up to $2.59$X. These results highlight the promise of
GEAK-like agentic code generation for accelerating the adoption of diverse
hardware platforms and democratizing access to expert-level kernel performance.

*Yunhao Liang,Ruixuan Ying,Takuya Taniguchi,Zhe Cui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve few-shot in-context learning (ICL) in large language models by utilizing both Positive and Negative samples, showing better outcomes than relying only on Positive examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the sensitivity of ICL performance to provided examples and improve the retrieval process by incorporating both Positive and Negative samples, unlike previous work focused only on Positive samples, mitigating biases in example selection.

Method: The approach builds Positive and Negative sample corpora based on Zero-Shot-Cot. A semantic similarity-based method retrieves the most relevant Positive and Negative examples for a query. Positive examples are further refined based on their similarity to Negative examples, and these refined sets are used as ICL demonstrations.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms methods that rely only on positive examples in terms of ICL performance, highlighting the benefit of leveraging both Positive and Negative samples.

Conclusion: Integrating Negative samples alongside Positive ones enhances the context selection process for ICL, improving performance by providing additional valuable information for selecting optimal examples.

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit powerful few-shot in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, but the performance is highly sensitive to provided examples.
  Recent research has focused on retrieving corresponding examples for each
input query, not only enhancing the efficiency and scalability of the learning
process but also mitigating inherent biases in manual example selection.
  However, these studies have primarily emphasized leveraging Positive samples
while overlooking the additional information within Negative samples for
contextual learning.
  We propose a novel method that utilizes Negative samples to better select
Positive sample examples, thereby enhancing the performance of few-shot ICL.
Initially, we construct Positive and Negative sample corpora based on
Zero-Shot-Cot. Then, during inference, we employ a semantic similarity-based
approach to select the most similar examples from both the Positive and
Negative corpora for a given query. Subsequently, we further retrieve Positive
examples from the Positive sample corpus based on semantic similarity to the
Negative examples, then concatenating them with the previously selected
Positive examples to serve as ICL demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach surpasses methods solely relying on the most
similar positive examples for context, validating that the additional
information in negative samples aids in enhancing ICL performance through
improved Positive sample selection.

*Carolina Zheng,Nicolas Beltran-Velez,Sweta Karlekar,Claudia Shi,Achille Nazaret,Asif Mallik,Amir Feder,David M. Blei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs) that derive topics from interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders, allowing more abstract themes and enabling steerable text generation. An LLM-based framework evaluates the models favorably against baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topic models inadequately capture semantically abstract features due to reliance on bag-of-words representations or simplistic word lists.

Method: MTMs define topics using sparse autoencoders to analyze rich interpretable features. A novel evaluation framework, 'topic judge,' employs LLM-based pairwise comparison to assess topic coherence and preference.

Result: MTMs outperform traditional and neural topic models in coherence metrics across various datasets and are preferred by the topic judge framework.

Conclusion: MTMs effectively uncover complex thematic representations while enabling controllable text generation, surpassing traditional models in evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Traditional topic models are effective at uncovering latent themes in large
text collections. However, due to their reliance on bag-of-words
representations, they struggle to capture semantically abstract features. While
some neural variants use richer representations, they are similarly constrained
by expressing topics as word lists, which limits their ability to articulate
complex topics. We introduce Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs), a class of topic
models that operate on interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders
(SAEs). By defining topics over this semantically rich space, MTMs can reveal
deeper conceptual themes with expressive feature descriptions. Moreover,
uniquely among topic models, MTMs enable controllable text generation using
topic-based steering vectors. To properly evaluate MTM topics against
word-list-based approaches, we propose \textit{topic judge}, an LLM-based
pairwise comparison evaluation framework. Across five datasets, MTMs match or
exceed traditional and neural baselines on coherence metrics, are consistently
preferred by topic judge, and enable effective steering of LLM outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the reasoning, integration, and interpretability capabilities of LLMs for early and accurate Alzheimer's diagnosis using structured heterogeneous data.

Method: Developed TAP-GPT by adapting TableGPT2, a specialized tabular LLM, using few-shot tabular prompts and qLoRA fine-tuning for binary classification of Alzheimer’s versus cognitively normal cases.

Result: TAP-GPT outperformed advanced general-purpose LLMs and tabular foundation models in Alzheimer’s disease prediction.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the utility of LLMs in biomedical applications, marking the first application of these models for predictive tasks on tabular biomarker data and setting the stage for broader innovations in the field.

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex
neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers
(e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal
fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible
few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based
interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented
opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a
novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts
TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for
business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data
with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using
in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes
TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary
classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework
harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the
encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose
LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To
our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task
using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent
frameworks in biomedical informatics.

Method: Introduce the P-ReMe dataset, redefine implicature and presupposition for mental health, benchmark multiple models, and propose StiPRompts for studying stigma in mental health discourse.

Result: Mistral and Qwen models demonstrated strong reasoning in implicature/presupposition, while Claude-3.5-haiku showed better handling of mental health stigma.

Conclusion: The work highlights advancements in pragmatic reasoning and stigma-sensitive language modeling within LLMs, suggesting specific models excel in these aspects.

Abstract: There has been an increase in recent advancements in the explainability and
development of personalized chatbots for mental health. However, the reasoning
aspects for explainability and dialogue discourse have not been explored
previously for mental health. Hence, we are investigating the pragmatic
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in this domain. We
introduce P-ReMe dataset, and propose a modified definition for the pragmatic
phenomena of implicature (implied meaning) and presupposition (implicit
assumption) in mental health. Following the definition, we formulate two tasks
in implicature and one task in presupposition. To benchmark the dataset and the
presented tasks, we consider four models - Llama3.1, Mistral, MentaLLaMa, and
Qwen. The results of the experiments suggest that Mistral and Qwen show
substantial reasoning capabilities in the domain. In addition, we also propose
StiPRompts to study the stigma around mental health with the state-of-the-art
LLMs, GPT-4o mini, Deepseek-chat, and Claude-3.5-haiku. Our evaluated findings
show that Claude-3.5-haiku deals with the stigma more responsibly compared to
the other two LLMs.

### [73] [Evaluating LLMs' Multilingual Capabilities for Bengali: Benchmark Creation and Performance Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23248)
*Shimanto Bhowmik,Tawsif Tashwar Dipto,Md Sazzad Islam,Sheryl Hsu,Tahsin Reasat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies Bengali NLP challenges, evaluates 10 large language models across 8 datasets, and identifies areas for improvement in model performance and evaluation standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bengali NLP is underexplored due to its linguistic uniqueness and lack of standardized benchmarks, motivating a comprehensive evaluation to improve research focus.

Method: The researchers evaluated 10 open-source large language models on 8 translated datasets, conducted error analysis, and studied tokenization effects.

Result: Performance gaps were identified between Bengali and English models, with robust performance in certain architectures, and issues with excessive tokenization impacting accuracy.

Conclusion: The study highlights key deficiencies in Bengali NLP models and datasets, emphasizing the need for better evaluation methods to enhance multilingual NLP research, especially for underrepresented languages.

Abstract: Bengali is an underrepresented language in NLP research. However, it remains
a challenge due to its unique linguistic structure and computational
constraints. In this work, we systematically investigate the challenges that
hinder Bengali NLP performance by focusing on the absence of standardized
evaluation benchmarks. We then evaluated 10 recent open source Large Language
Models (LLMs) in 8 of the translated datasets and performed a comprehensive
error analysis to pinpoint their primary failure modes. Our findings reveal
consistent performance gaps for Bengali compared to English, particularly for
smaller models and specific model families like Mistral. We also identified
promising robustness in certain architectures, such as DeepSeek, that maintain
more stable performance across languages. Our analysis reveals an inverse
relationship between tokenization efficiency and LLM accuracy where models tend
to perform worse when inputs are excessively tokenized, whereas more efficient
\& concise tokenization results in improved performance. These findings
highlight critical areas where current models fall short and underscore the
need for improved dataset quality and evaluation methodologies tailored to
multilingual contexts. This work will catalyze further research on NLP for
underrepresented languages, helping to democratize access to advanced language
technologies worldwide. The code and dataset used in this research is publicly
available at https://github.com/BengaliAI/bn-llm-benchmark.

*Zunhai Su,Qingyuan Li,Hao Zhang,YuLei Qian,Yuchen Xie,Kehong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies and studies a small subset of crucial experts, labeled as Super Experts (SEs), within Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, revealing their significant influence on model performance and proposing insights into their functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to better understand the heterogeneous importance of experts within Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, as existing methods lack a thorough exploration of how certain experts impact the model's performance.

Method: The study analyzes critical experts, termed Super Experts (SEs), using activation patterns and their effects on performance. It investigates the distinct characteristics of SEs, measures their impact on task performance by pruning, and explores their role in computation such as inducing attention sinks.

Result: The authors discover that Super Experts (SEs) are rare but highly impactful on model performance, significantly affecting outputs and attention mechanisms when pruned. SEs are model-specific and are integral to tasks like mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: Super Experts (SEs) play a pivotal role in the computation and performance of MoE models. Pruning them disrupts critical operations like attention sinks and results in degraded model behavior, emphasizing the necessity of preserving such experts for optimal performance.

Abstract: Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promise in
enhancing the learning capacity of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the
intrinsic importance differences among experts, recent research has explored
expert-level compression techniques to improve the efficiency of MoE LLMs.
However, existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify
critical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the
heterogeneous importance of experts. In this study, we present the first
discovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial
role in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference. These
experts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their limited
number, pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance (e.g.,
pruning three causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to produce repetitive and uninformative
outputs). We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive
analysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs. (i) SEs are
characterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the
down_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between
decoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs remains model-specific and is
unaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their
significance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on
the model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning. (iii)
We further enhance our understanding of the influence of SEs compression. Our
findings confirm that MoE LLMs rely on SEs to induce attention sinks, which are
crucial for the distribution of attention scores but are significantly
disrupted by SE pruning. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines how GPT-4o-mini implicitly moderates language when paraphrasing sensitive content and its zero-shot sensitivity classification capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether large language models, without explicit instructions, sanitize sensitive language and to examine their ability to classify sentence sensitivity.

Method: The study involves paraphrasing experiments with GPT-4o-mini to observe implicit moderation behavior, focusing on sensitivity shifts. Additionally, it evaluates the zero-shot classification performance of LLMs in detecting sentence sensitivity compared to traditional methods.

Result: Findings indicate that GPT-4o-mini reduces derogatory and taboo language during paraphrasing and can zero-shot classify sentence sensitivity effectively.

Conclusion: LLMs like GPT-4o-mini inherently moderate sensitive content and exhibit promising zero-shot classification capabilities, making them useful for content moderation tasks.

Abstract: Proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tendencies toward
politeness, formality, and implicit content moderation. While previous research
has primarily focused on explicitly training models to moderate and detoxify
sensitive content, there has been limited exploration of whether LLMs
implicitly sanitize language without explicit instructions. This study
empirically analyzes the implicit moderation behavior of GPT-4o-mini when
paraphrasing sensitive content and evaluates the extent of sensitivity shifts.
Our experiments indicate that GPT-4o-mini systematically moderates content
toward less sensitive classes, with substantial reductions in derogatory and
taboo language. Also, we evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in
classifying sentence sensitivity, comparing their performances against
traditional methods.

*Daeyong Kwon,SeungHeon Doh,Juhan Nam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MusT-RAG enhances large language models (LLMs) for music-related tasks by combining Retrieval Augmented Generation with a specialized music database.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show limited performance in music-related applications due to insufficient music-specific knowledge in their training data.

Method: The paper introduces MusT-RAG, a framework leveraging a music-specialized database (MusWikiDB) for retrieval augmented generation to adapt general-purpose LLMs using context during inference and fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments show MusT-RAG outperforms standard fine-tuning in music domain adaptation and delivers better performance and efficiency using MusWikiDB.

Conclusion: MusT-RAG is a promising approach for improving LLMs' performance in music-related tasks, bridging gaps in domain-specific knowledge efficiently.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. While they exhibit strong
zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related
applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of
music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we
propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question
answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to
LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to
questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a
music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes
context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to
effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our
experiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional
fine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities,
showing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA
benchmarks. Additionally, our MusWikiDB proves substantially more effective
than general Wikipedia corpora, delivering superior performance and
computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TeQoDO, an unsupervised method enabling large language models (LLMs) to autonomously construct task-oriented dialogue ontologies using its SQL capabilities and dialogue theory. It outperforms traditional methods and scales effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of parametric knowledge in LLMs (low explainability and trustworthiness) and the labor-intensive manual work involved in constructing ontologies for task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems.

Method: The paper introduces TeQoDO, which combines LLMs’ SQL programming capabilities with dialogue theory in prompts to build TOD ontologies autonomously without supervised training.

Result: TeQoDO surpasses transfer learning techniques in constructing ontologies and performs competitively on dialogue state tracking tasks. It can also generate larger-scale ontologies on datasets like Wikipedia and ArXiv.

Conclusion: TeQoDO demonstrates the potential of using unsupervised ontology construction for improving the explainability and scalability of LLMs in TOD systems and beyond.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as general-purpose knowledge
sources, but they rely on parametric knowledge, limiting explainability and
trustworthiness. In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, this separation is
explicit, using an external database structured by an explicit ontology to
ensure explainability and controllability. However, building such ontologies
requires manual labels or supervised training. We introduce TeQoDO: a
Text-to-SQL task-oriented Dialogue Ontology construction method. Here, an LLM
autonomously builds a TOD ontology from scratch without supervision using its
inherent SQL programming capabilities combined with dialogue theory provided in
the prompt. We show that TeQoDO outperforms transfer learning approaches, and
its constructed ontology is competitive on a downstream dialogue state tracking
task. Ablation studies demonstrate the key role of dialogue theory. TeQoDO also
scales to allow construction of much larger ontologies, which we investigate on
a Wikipedia and ArXiv dataset. We view this as a step towards broader
application of ontologies to increase LLM explainability.

*Yiyan Ji,Haoran Chen,Qiguang Chen,Chengyue Wu,Libo Qin,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MPCC, a benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning tasks, highlighting major challenges in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks are inadequate for assessing multimodal planning capabilities and often lack constraints across modalities.

Method: Develop the MPCC benchmark focusing on real-world multimodal planning tasks with complex graded constraints for systematic evaluation.

Result: Experiments show poor performance of MLLMs on these tasks, with sensitivity to constraint complexity and failure of traditional multimodal prompting strategies.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for advancements in constraint-aware reasoning for effective real-world applications of MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and
design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for
complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current
benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal
real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit
constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal
Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically
evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To
address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight
Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second
challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and
spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to
separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13
advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only
21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally,
we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that
traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios.
Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous
evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in
constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.

### [79] [Causal2Vec: Improving Decoder-only LLMs as Versatile Embedding Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23386)
*Ailiang Lin,Zhuoyun Li,Kotaro Funakoshi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Causal2Vec,' an embedding model designed to optimize decoder-only large language models without altering architectures or adding significant computational costs. It utilizes a lightweight pre-encoding approach and combines token outputs for final embedding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for embedding using decoder-only models often compromise semantic extraction during pretraining or rely on extra inputs that increase computation.

Method: The Causal2Vec approach uses a lightweight BERT-style model to pre-encode the input into a Contextual token, combines this with EOS token outputs to create embeddings, and mitigates recency bias.

Result: Causal2Vec achieves top performance in the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark using publicly available datasets, reducing sequence lengths by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82%.

Conclusion: Causal2Vec significantly enhances embedding tasks for decoder-only LLMs, maintaining architecture integrity and improving efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build
embedding models that effectively encode the semantic information of natural
language texts into dense vector representations for various embedding tasks.
However, many existing methods primarily focus on removing the causal attention
mask in LLMs to enable bidirectional attention, potentially undermining the
model's ability to extract semantic information acquired during pretraining.
Additionally, leading unidirectional approaches often rely on extra input text
to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention, inevitably increasing
computational costs. In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose
embedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs
without altering their original architectures or introducing significant
computational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style
model to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is
then prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture
contextualized information even without attending to future tokens.
Furthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and
help LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual
token, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as
the final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models
trained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the
required sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared
to best-performing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the challenges of data privacy, equitable access, and security posed by proprietary, cloud-based language models in the translation field.

Method: Three open-source language models installed on CPU-based platforms were assessed for functional performance compared to online commercial AI chatbots, emphasizing accessibility and usability.

Result: Local deployment of open-source models offers enhanced data control, privacy benefits, and reduces reliance on cloud services, although it presents unique challenges.

Conclusion: The findings support democratizing AI technology by making locally deployable LLMs more accessible, which is beneficial for individual translators and small businesses.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models presents both opportunities
and challenges for the translation field. While commercial, cloud-based AI
chatbots have garnered significant attention in translation studies, concerns
regarding data privacy, security, and equitable access necessitate exploration
of alternative deployment models. This paper investigates the feasibility and
performance of locally deployable, free language models as a viable alternative
to proprietary, cloud-based AI solutions. This study evaluates three
open-source models installed on CPU-based platforms and compared against
commercially available online chat-bots. The evaluation focuses on functional
performance rather than a comparative analysis of human-machine translation
quality, an area already subject to extensive research. The platforms assessed
were chosen for their accessibility and ease of use across various operating
systems. While local deployment introduces its own challenges, the benefits of
enhanced data control, improved privacy, and reduced dependency on cloud
services are compelling. The findings of this study contribute to a growing
body of knowledge concerning the democratization of AI technology and inform
future research and development efforts aimed at making LLMs more accessible
and practical for a wider range of users, specifically focusing on the needs of
individual translators and small businesses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes MRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework that uses multi-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization to address redundancy and complexity in summarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing summarization methods that rely on single-relational graphs and predefined cluster numbers, reducing their adaptability and effectiveness.

Method: This approach builds a multi-relational graph capturing semantic and discourse relations. It employs a structural entropy minimization algorithm to cluster sentences adaptively and uses position-aware compression to produce summaries.

Result: MRGSEM-Sum outperforms previous unsupervised approaches and often competes with supervised models and large language models on benchmark datasets. Human evaluation also supports its high quality.

Conclusion: MRGSEM-Sum effectively reduces redundancy, captures complex relationships, and generates summaries with strong consistency and coverage, proving its unsupervised innovation is highly competitive with other advanced methods.

Abstract: The core challenge faced by multi-document summarization is the complexity of
relationships among documents and the presence of information redundancy. Graph
clustering is an effective paradigm for addressing this issue, as it models the
complex relationships among documents using graph structures and reduces
information redundancy through clustering, achieving significant research
progress. However, existing methods often only consider single-relational
graphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability
to fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition
sentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose
MRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on
multi-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization. Specifically, we
construct a multi-relational graph that integrates semantic and discourse
relations between sentences, comprehensively modeling the intricate and dynamic
connections among sentences across documents. We then apply a two-dimensional
structural entropy minimization algorithm for clustering, automatically
determining the optimal number of clusters and effectively organizing sentences
into coherent groups. Finally, we introduce a position-aware compression
mechanism to distill each cluster, generating concise and informative
summaries. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (Multi-News,
DUC-2004, PubMed, and WikiSum) demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms previous unsupervised methods and, in several cases, achieves
performance comparable to supervised models and large language models. Human
evaluation demonstrates that the summaries generated by MRGSEM-Sum exhibit high
consistency and coverage, approaching human-level quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic poses unique challenges in NLP and IR due to complex morphology, optional diacritics, and coexisting language forms. There's a lack of representation in research and benchmarks for Arabic.

Method: The authors introduce the Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS) mechanism, integrated with pre-trained Arabic models and architectural improvements to enhance semantic relevance in Arabic question-answering systems.

Result: The proposed framework significantly improves retrieval performance and ranking accuracy for answering questions in Arabic.

Conclusion: The enhanced Dense Passage Retrieval framework addresses specific challenges in Arabic NLP, leveraging ARS and architectural refinements for better retrieval outcomes. The code is made publicly accessible.

Abstract: Arabic poses a particular challenge for natural language processing (NLP) and
information retrieval (IR) due to its complex morphology, optional diacritics
and the coexistence of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various dialects.
Despite the growing global significance of Arabic, it is still underrepresented
in NLP research and benchmark resources. In this paper, we present an enhanced
Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) framework developed specifically for Arabic. At
the core of our approach is a novel Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS) that
replaces standard interaction mechanisms with an adaptive scoring function that
more effectively models the semantic relevance between questions and passages.
Our method integrates pre-trained Arabic language models and architectural
refinements to improve retrieval performance and significantly increase ranking
accuracy when answering Arabic questions. The code is made publicly available

*Ante Wang,Yujie Lin,Jingyao Liu,Suhang Wu,Hao Liu,Xinyan Xiao,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces proactive critical thinking in AI models, focusing on scenarios where models actively seek out missing or clarifying information instead of passively rejecting problematic queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of current AI systems which often passively reject flawed queries without employing constructive methods to resolve them.

Method: The researchers propose and evaluate proactive critical thinking through two new benchmarks, GSM-MC and GSM-MCE, which involve math problems with missing or misleading information. They train and test models using reinforcement learning to improve their critical thinking capabilities.

Result: Reinforcement learning significantly enhanced the models' performance, with Qwen3-1.7B's accuracy on the GSM-MC benchmark increasing from 0.15% to 73.98%.

Conclusion: Proactive critical thinking can enable AI systems to collaborate more effectively with users, and reinforcement learning is a viable path to achieving this capability.

Abstract: Critical thinking is essential for building robust AI systems, preventing
them from blindly accepting flawed data or biased reasoning. However, prior
work has primarily focused on passive critical thinking, where models simply
reject problematic queries without taking constructive steps to address user
requests. In this work, we introduce proactive critical thinking, a paradigm
where models actively seek missing or clarifying information from users to
resolve their queries better. To evaluate this capability, we present GSM-MC
and GSM-MCE, two novel benchmarks based on GSM8K for assessing mathematical
reasoning under incomplete or misleading conditions. GSM-MC contains 1,368 math
problems with a key variable deliberately removed, requiring models to identify
and request the missing information. GSM-MCE further increases the difficulty
by introducing irrelevant details to test robustness against distractions.
Experiments on Qwen3 and Llama series models show that, while these models
excel in traditional reasoning tasks due to extensive post-training and
inference-time scaling, they struggle with proactive critical thinking,
especially smaller ones. However, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning
(RL) can significantly improve this ability. Using our enhanced RL algorithm,
we achieve substantial gains, boosting the Qwen3-1.7B's accuracy from 0.15% to
73.98% on GSM-MC. We hope this work advances models that collaborate more
effectively with users in problem-solving through proactive critical thinking.

TL;DR: This paper explores fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to generate responses reflecting role-specific access privileges in enterprise settings, using three modeling strategies and two datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to meet the essential requirement of controlling LLM behaviors based on user roles in enterprise environments, where existing safety methods fall short by assuming uniform access and neglecting role-specific constraints.

Method: The study investigates three modeling strategies: a BERT-based classifier, an LLM-based classifier, and role-conditioned generation. It uses two datasets—one adapted with clustering and role labeling, and one synthetically created for realistic role-sensitive scenarios.

Result: The evaluation is conducted across different organizational structures, including robustness checks for scenarios like prompt injection, role mismatch, and jailbreak attempts.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the feasibility of fine-tuning LLMs to address role-based access in enterprises, paving the way for more secure model deployments in such settings.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
settings, controlling model behavior based on user roles becomes an essential
requirement. Existing safety methods typically assume uniform access and focus
on preventing harmful or toxic outputs, without addressing role-specific access
constraints. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can be fine-tuned to
generate responses that reflect the access privileges associated with different
organizational roles. We explore three modeling strategies: a BERT-based
classifier, an LLM-based classifier, and role-conditioned generation. To
evaluate these approaches, we construct two complementary datasets. The first
is adapted from existing instruction-tuning corpora through clustering and role
labeling, while the second is synthetically generated to reflect realistic,
role-sensitive enterprise scenarios. We assess model performance across varying
organizational structures and analyze robustness to prompt injection, role
mismatch, and jailbreak attempts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the safety and effectiveness evaluation of LLMs in clinical decision support, which is critical for their reliable deployment in healthcare.

Method: The researchers developed a multidimensional framework with 30 clinical criteria, involving 2,069 Q&A items reviewed by 32 physicians from 26 departments to test six LLMs against real-world scenarios.

Result: LLMs achieved moderate performance (overall score: 57.2% safety: 54.7%, effectiveness: 62.3%), with domain-specific medical LLMs outperforming general-purpose ones. High-risk scenarios saw a performance drop (13.3%, p < 0.0001).

Conclusion: The study provides a standardized evaluation metric for medical LLMs, emphasizing their risks and areas for improvement, and aims to facilitate safer and more effective use of LLMs in healthcare.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in clinical decision support but
face major challenges in safety evaluation and effectiveness validation. We
developed the Clinical Safety-Effectiveness Dual-Track Benchmark (CSEDB), a
multidimensional framework built on clinical expert consensus, encompassing 30
criteria covering critical areas like critical illness recognition, guideline
adherence, and medication safety, with weighted consequence measures.
Thirty-two specialist physicians developed and reviewed 2,069 open-ended Q&A
items aligned with these criteria, spanning 26 clinical departments to simulate
real-world scenarios. Benchmark testing of six LLMs revealed moderate overall
performance (average total score 57.2%, safety 54.7%, effectiveness 62.3%),
with a significant 13.3% performance drop in high-risk scenarios (p < 0.0001).
Domain-specific medical LLMs showed consistent performance advantages over
general-purpose models, with relatively higher top scores in safety (0.912) and
effectiveness (0.861). The findings of this study not only provide a
standardized metric for evaluating the clinical application of medical LLMs,
facilitating comparative analyses, risk exposure identification, and
improvement directions across different scenarios, but also hold the potential
to promote safer and more effective deployment of large language models in

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in medical knowledge reasoning focus on either retrieval or reasoning separately, are heavily reliant on supervised fine-tuning, and lack effective reward function designs specific to the medical domain.

Method: The paper proposes a stepwise framework focusing on logical reasoning development, adaptive optimization of retrieval capabilities, and joint optimization of retrieval and reasoning coordination using reinforcement learning.

Result: Med-R$^3$ achieves state-of-the-art performances, with notable improvements over GPT-4o-mini and Qwen2.5-14B in medical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Med-R$^3$ proves to be an effective solution for coordinated retrieval-augmented reasoning in medical applications, overcoming limitations of earlier models and demonstrating strong generalization.

Abstract: In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and
leveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance.
Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing
either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with
little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited
coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely
heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize
existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization
ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some
studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general
domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not
adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these
challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented
**R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In
this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical
reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation,
we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the
characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization
throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the
model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate
that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by
3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with
Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.

*Alva West,Luodan Zhang,Liuliu Zhang,Minjun Zhu,Yixuan Weng,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduction of T-Detect, employing heavy-tailed statistical measures using the Student's t-distribution for robust machine-generated text detection under adversarial conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust detection methods arises from the proliferation of sophisticated text generation models capable of adversarial evasion, rendering traditional statistical assumptions inadequate.

Method: T-Detect uses a heavy-tailed discrepancy score based on the Student's t-distribution instead of Gaussian normalization, computing scores based on log-likelihood normalized against t-distribution moments.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks like RAID and HART show consistent performance improvement, achieving a state-of-the-art AUROC of 0.926 in certain domains.

Conclusion: T-Detect redefines statistical foundations for text detection by leveraging Student’s t-distribution, yielding superior robustness in adversarial scenarios and setting new benchmarks in performance.

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated text generation models necessitates the
development of robust detection methods capable of identifying
machine-generated content, particularly text designed to evade detection
through adversarial perturbations. Existing zero-shot detectors often rely on
statistical measures that implicitly assume Gaussian distributions, a premise
that falters when confronted with the heavy-tailed statistical artifacts
characteristic of adversarial or non-native English texts. This paper
introduces T-Detect, a novel detection method that fundamentally redesigns the
statistical core of curvature-based detectors. Our primary innovation is the
replacement of standard Gaussian normalization with a heavy-tailed discrepancy
score derived from the Student's t-distribution. This approach is theoretically
grounded in the empirical observation that adversarial texts exhibit
significant leptokurtosis, rendering traditional statistical assumptions
inadequate. T-Detect computes a detection score by normalizing the
log-likelihood of a passage against the expected moments of a t-distribution,
providing superior resilience to statistical outliers. We validate our approach
on the challenging RAID benchmark for adversarial text and the comprehensive
HART dataset. Experiments show that T-Detect provides a consistent performance
uplift over strong baselines, improving AUROC by up to 3.9\% in targeted
domains. When integrated into a two-dimensional detection framework (CT), our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an AUROC of 0.926 on the
Books domain of RAID. Our contributions are a new, theoretically-justified
statistical foundation for text detection, an ablation-validated method that
demonstrates superior robustness, and a comprehensive analysis of its
performance under adversarial conditions. Ours code are released at

*Alexandre Misrahi,Nadezhda Chirkova,Maxime Louis,Vassilina Nikoulina*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiffLoRA, a parameter-efficient adaptation of the Differential Transformer model for NLP tasks, but results show mixed improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance the efficiency of differential attention mechanisms in Transformers while retaining low computational costs.

Method: Introduced DiffLoRA with low-rank adapters applied to both positive and negative attention terms of the differential attention mechanism.

Result: Mixed outcomes with DiffLoRA; it underperforms compared to other fine-tuning methods but performs notably well on certain tasks (e.g., +11 points improvement on LoRA for HumanEval).

Conclusion: DiffLoRA offers interesting benefits in specific domains but may need refinements to compete broadly with other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Differential Transformer has recently been proposed to improve performance in
Transformer models by canceling out noise through a denoiser attention
mechanism. In this work, we introduce DiffLoRA, a parameter-efficient
adaptation of the differential attention mechanism, with low-rank adapters on
both positive and negative attention terms. This approach retains the
efficiency of LoRA while aiming to benefit from the performance gains of
differential attention. We evaluate DiffLoRA across a broad range of NLP tasks,
including general benchmarks, many-shot in-context learning, RAG, and
long-context tests. We observe that, although DiffLoRA falls short of other
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in most evaluation tasks, it shows
interesting results in certain domains (+11 pts on LoRA for HumanEval). We
analyze the attention patterns post-finetuning to identify the reasons for this
behavior.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses hate speech detection and masking in Arabic social media text, achieving high performance using deep learning and transformer-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the growing issue of hate speech on social media platforms, specifically for Arabic text.

Method: Deep learning models and transformers are utilized for hate speech detection, while text cleaning is approached as a machine translation task to mask bad words.

Result: Achieved 92% Macro F1 score and 95% accuracy in hate speech detection; 0.3 BLEU score in text masking using 1-gram.

Conclusion: The proposed methods are effective for hate speech detection and text masking, setting benchmarks for similar tasks in Arabic language processing.

Abstract: Hate speech identification in social media has become an increasingly
important issue in recent years. In this research, we address two problems: 1)
to detect hate speech in Arabic text, 2) to clean a given text from hate
speech. The meaning of cleaning here is replacing each bad word with stars
based on the number of letters for each word. Regarding the first problem, we
conduct several experiments using deep learning models and transformers to
determine the best model in terms of the F1 score. Regarding second problem, we
consider it as a machine translation task, where the input is a sentence
containing dirty text and the output is the same sentence with masking the
dirty text. The presented methods achieve the best model in hate speech
detection with a 92\% Macro F1 score and 95\% accuracy. Regarding the text
cleaning experiment, the best result in the hate speech masking model reached
0.3 in BLEU score with 1-gram, which is a good result compared with the state
of the art machine translation systems.

### [90] [Rule2Text: Natural Language Explanation of Logical Rules in Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23740)
*Nasim Shirvani-Mahdavi,Devin Wingfield,Amin Ghasemi,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language explanations for logical rules extracted from knowledge graphs, with evaluations on correctness, clarity, and hallucination accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge graphs contain valuable information, and logical rules improve their completeness, error detection, and reasoning ability, but their complexity makes understanding difficult for humans.

Method: Logical rules were extracted using the AMIE 3.5.1 algorithm from various datasets. The paper explored prompting strategies, including zero/few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning. Human evaluation and LLM-based automatic judging were conducted.

Result: The study found promising performance in generating correct and clear explanations with large language models, though challenges in hallucination and refinement remain.

Conclusion: While large language models show potential in creating understandable explanations for logical rules in KGs, improvements are needed for broader adoption and reliability.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) often contain sufficient information to support the
inference of new facts. Identifying logical rules not only improves the
completeness of a knowledge graph but also enables the detection of potential
errors, reveals subtle data patterns, and enhances the overall capacity for
reasoning and interpretation. However, the complexity of such rules, combined
with the unique labeling conventions of each KG, can make them difficult for
humans to understand. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language
models to generate natural language explanations for logical rules.
Specifically, we extract logical rules using the AMIE 3.5.1 rule discovery
algorithm from the benchmark dataset FB15k-237 and two large-scale datasets,
FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. We examine various prompting strategies, including
zero- and few-shot prompting, including variable entity types, and
chain-of-thought reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive human evaluation of the
generated explanations based on correctness, clarity, and hallucination, and
also assess the use of large language models as automatic judges. Our results
demonstrate promising performance in terms of explanation correctness and
clarity, although several challenges remain for future research. All scripts

### [91] [Cascaded Information Disclosure for Generalized Evaluation of Problem Solving Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23776)
*Yunxiang Yan,Tomohiro Sawada,Kartik Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new evaluation method for LLMs using cascaded question disclosure, focusing on better assessing problem-solving capabilities rather than traditional QA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional QA benchmarks indirectly evaluate LLMs and may not accurately measure their problem-solving abilities, prompting the need for a more holistic framework.

Method: The authors introduce a staged evaluation method called cascaded question disclosure, providing partial question information at each stage to prompt generalized reasoning in LLMs.

Result: The proposed method offers a clearer comparison between LLMs and produces improved intermediate reasoning traces, reducing the perceived performance gaps in traditional QA evaluations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that cascaded question disclosure is a more accurate and scalable framework to evaluate LLMs, challenging existing QA paradigms and highlighting overstated differences in model performance.

Abstract: While question-answering~(QA) benchmark performance is an automatic and
scalable method to compare LLMs, it is an indirect method of evaluating their
underlying problem-solving capabilities. Therefore, we propose a holistic and
generalizable framework based on \emph{cascaded question disclosure} that
provides a more accurate estimate of the models' problem-solving capabilities
while maintaining the scalability and automation. This approach collects model
responses in a stagewise manner with each stage revealing partial information
about the question designed to elicit generalized reasoning in LLMs. We find
that our approach not only provides a better comparison between LLMs, but also
induces better intermediate traces in models compared to the standard QA
paradigm. We empirically verify this behavior on diverse reasoning and
knowledge-heavy QA datasets by comparing LLMs of varying sizes and families.
Our approach narrows the performance gap observed in the standard QA evaluation
settings, indicating that the prevalent indirect QA paradigm of evaluation
overestimates the differences in performance between models. We further
validate our findings by extensive ablation studies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for quick urban scene reconstruction and real-time rendering that balances efficiency and visual fidelity, addressing appearance variations and achieving superior results compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve inefficiencies and improve fidelity in reconstructing urban-scale scenes for real-time rendering, especially when faced with appearance variations across multi-view images.

Method: The framework partitions scenes for parallel training using visibility-based image selection, employs a LOD strategy for regulating density, adjusts appearance inconsistencies using a transformation module, and uses enhancement modules like depth regularization for improved quality.

Result: Experimental results show that the method achieves efficient and high-quality urban-scale scene reconstruction, outperforming previous methods in terms of efficiency and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses challenges in urban-scale scene reconstruction by providing a robust and efficient solution, marking an advancement over prior approaches.

Abstract: We present a framework that enables fast reconstruction and real-time
rendering of urban-scale scenes while maintaining robustness against appearance
variations across multi-view captures. Our approach begins with scene
partitioning for parallel training, employing a visibility-based image
selection strategy to optimize training efficiency. A controllable
level-of-detail (LOD) strategy explicitly regulates Gaussian density under a
user-defined budget, enabling efficient training and rendering while
maintaining high visual fidelity. The appearance transformation module
mitigates the negative effects of appearance inconsistencies across images
while enabling flexible adjustments. Additionally, we utilize enhancement
modules, such as depth regularization, scale regularization, and antialiasing,
to improve reconstruction fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method effectively reconstructs urban-scale scenes and outperforms previous
approaches in both efficiency and quality. The source code is available at:

*Giuseppe Cartella,Vittorio Cuculo,Alessandro D'Amelio,Marcella Cornia,Giuseppe Boccignone,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ScanDiff, a novel deep learning model for predicting realistic and diverse human gaze scanpaths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing scanpath prediction methods that often produce averaged behaviors and lack variability, the authors aim to generate more realistic and diverse gaze prediction models.

Method: The authors propose ScanDiff, which combines diffusion models with Vision Transformers and incorporates textual conditioning for task-driven scanpath prediction.

Result: ScanDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in producing diverse and accurate scanpaths across benchmark datasets for both free-viewing and task-driven tasks.

Conclusion: ScanDiff advances gaze prediction research by better capturing the complexity of human visual behavior and setting a higher standard for scanpath generation models.

Abstract: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual
attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems,
and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath
prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to
capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present
ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision
Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly
models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion
models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we
introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation,
allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments
on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and
accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the
complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

*Ranxi Lin,Canming Yao,Jiayi Li,Weihang Liu,Xin Lou,Pingqiang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a spike-based NeRF framework with adaptive training strategies to enhance energy efficiency in 3D rendering while maintaining fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high computational cost of NeRF-based models in 3D rendering tasks, which limits their application in resource-constrained scenarios like edge computing.

Method: The authors propose the Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step Adjustment (PATA) strategy, integrated with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), allowing dynamic exploration of rendering quality and time step length during training.

Result: Experimental evaluations show significant improvements, including reducing inference time steps by 64% and running power consumption by 61.55%, while preserving rendering quality.

Conclusion: The proposed PATA approach demonstrates its potential in enabling energy-efficient and scalable 3D rendering for diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success
in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and
inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from
multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and
severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge
computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes
over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their
energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and
texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training
separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a
dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step
Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between
rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it
enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the
additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process.
Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method
across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve
rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running
power by 61.55\%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores the use of deep learning-based super-resolution models to enhance low-quality echocardiograms for better diagnostic accuracy in resource-constrained settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of poor-quality echocardiographic imaging in resource-constrained settings, which limits the effectiveness of diagnostic models.

Method: The authors used two deep learning-based super-resolution models, SRGAN and SRResNet, tested on the CAMUS dataset for two classification tasks: 2CH vs. 4CH view classification and ED vs. ES phase classification.

Result: Both SRGAN and SRResNet improved diagnostic performance on low-quality images, with SRResNet demonstrating higher gains and better computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Super-resolution techniques can vastly improve the diagnostic value of degraded echocardiographic scans, enabling better AI-assisted healthcare in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is
often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the
effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR)
techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely
accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate the potential of deep learning-based SR to improve classification
accuracy on low-quality 2D echocardiograms. Using the publicly available CAMUS
dataset, we stratify samples by image quality and evaluate two clinically
relevant tasks of varying complexity: a relatively simple Two-Chamber vs.
Four-Chamber (2CH vs. 4CH) view classification and a more complex End-Diastole
vs. End-Systole (ED vs. ES) phase classification. We apply two widely used SR
models-Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and
Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), to enhance poor-quality images
and observe significant gains in performance metric-particularly with SRResNet,
which also offers computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that SR
can effectively recover diagnostic value in degraded echo scans, making it a
viable tool for AI-assisted care in RCS, achieving more with less.

in matching anatomical locations across pairs of medical images. We validated
our approach on diverse longitudinal internal and public datasets spanning CT
and MRI modalities. Notably, it surpasses state-of-the-art results on the Deep
Lesion Tracking dataset. Additionally, we show that the method effectively
addresses landmark localization. The algorithm operates efficiently on standard

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NovaDrive introduces a vision-language architecture improving autonomous vehicle navigation by integrating front-camera images, HD maps, LiDAR depth, and waypoints, achieving enhanced safety and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous vehicles to react in real-time to complex road environments by integrating diverse sensory inputs and eliminating abrupt vehicle movements.

Method: Developed NovaDrive, which processes multimodal inputs (images, maps, LiDAR, and waypoints) in a single-branch vision-language model, incorporating cross-attention blocks and a smoothness loss function.

Result: NovaDrive achieved an 84% success rate, improved path efficiency (SPL) by 0.11, and halved collision frequency on benchmark datasets compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: NovaDrive improves safety, efficiency, and resource usage in autonomous navigation, while also offering scalability to other embodied AI domains.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road
geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce
NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes
front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a
single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns
waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image
and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt
steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent
memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language
backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the
MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts
path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from
2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations
confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention
fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's
shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower
fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving
stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

*Alexandru Buburuzan*

TL;DR: The paper presents two innovative methods, MObI and AnydoorMed, for generating synthetic data in autonomous driving and medical imaging by leveraging diffusion models for realistic and controllable multimodal object inpainting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and complexity of acquiring extensive multimodal real-world data required for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and medical image analysis, highlighting the need for realistic and controllable synthetic data generation.

Method: The paper introduces MObI, a framework using diffusion models for multimodal object inpainting, and AnydoorMed, a diffusion-based reference-guided inpainting method for medical imaging. Both methods use advanced techniques like 3D bounding box conditioning for spatial accuracy and structural integrity in complex data.

Result: MObI successfully enables seamless object insertion into multimodal scenes, maintaining semantic consistency and coherence, while AnydoorMed effectively inpaints anomalies in medical scans with preserved detail and structural integrity.

Conclusion: Foundation models for reference-guided inpainting can be adapted to various perceptual modalities, enabling the creation of realistic, controllable, and multimodal synthetic data for critical applications.

Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image
analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic
data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering
real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability
to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data
generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and
AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal
Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and
controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated
simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI
enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a
specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic
consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods
that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning
to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed
extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on
reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a
diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,
maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically
blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate
that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be
readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next
generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable
and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.

*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan,Murari Ambati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents XYZ-Drive, a vision-language model enabling autonomous cars to achieve high geometric and semantic understanding for navigating complex environments, integrating perception and control into a unified multimodal framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a cohesive approach that combines geometric accuracy and semantic understanding in autonomous cars, replacing traditional separate stacks and enhancing action and explanation capabilities.

Method: Developed XYZ-Drive, which processes a front-camera frame, an overhead map, and a waypoint using a goal-centered cross-attention mechanism fused with a partially fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 model, enabling steering and speed output alongside textual explanations.

Result: Achieved 95% success and 0.80 SPL on the MD-NEX benchmark with significant improvements in collision reduction and efficiency compared to prior methods, and demonstrated via ablations the critical importance of multimodal integration, goal-centered attention, and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Token-level fusion of intent and map layout in a unified framework improves accuracy, transparency, and real-time capabilities for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to
navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We
present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera
frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs
steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets
waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both
action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially
fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and
0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and
halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only
a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality
(vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their
complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention
with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion
injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses
5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks
such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs
lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent
and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

*Dmitry Demidov,Zaigham Zaheer,Omkar Thawakar,Salman Khan,Fahad Shahbaz Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces E-FineR (Enriched-FineR), a training-free method that achieves state-of-the-art results in fine-grained visual recognition using a vocabulary-free and interpretability-focused approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional fine-grained image classification methods, such as reliance on fixed vocabularies and closed-set paradigms, and to leverage LLM and VLM capabilities more effectively.

Method: E-FineR is a vocabulary-free, training-free approach that utilizes enriched interpretability and combines language-driven understanding with visual models for fine-grained image classification. It applies to both zero-shot and few-shot classification settings.

Result: E-FineR achieved state-of-the-art performance in fine-grained visual recognition, matching existing SOTA in zero-shot and few-shot classification, without human intervention or training.

Conclusion: E-FineR shifts image classification from fixed label predictions towards a flexible and scalable language-driven understanding, making it suitable for real-world, large-scale, and dynamic domains.

Abstract: Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between
visually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species,
car models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem.
Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set
classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in
real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has
demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language
models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for
predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in
harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily
on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and
refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,
Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art
results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater
interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and
new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we
demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot
classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA
while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our
vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid
label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable
and generalizable systems for real-world applications. Well-documented code is
available on https://github.com/demidovd98/e-finer.

*Sanghun Jung,Jingjing Zheng,Ke Zhang,Nan Qiao,Albert Y. C. Chen,Lu Xia,Chi Liu,Yuyin Sun,Xiao Zeng,Hsiang-Wei Huang,Byron Boots,Min Sun,Cheng-Hao Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new state-of-the-art solution for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) by combining multiple complementary concepts and refining them to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges in open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation, including better proposal generation and classification.

Method: They use a two-stage scheme: robust 3D proposal aggregation with iterative merging/removal for proposal generation, and Alpha-CLIP with object mask representation for classification. Additionally, they propose the standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to improve precision.

Result: Their approach outperforms both open-vocabulary and closed-vocabulary methods on ScanNet200 and S3DIS datasets across all AP and AR metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively combines and refines existing concepts to push the boundaries of open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation and achieve state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained
end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages
vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify
them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we
observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but
complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for
OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and
refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage
scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D
tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove
overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the
classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which
incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and
obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the
standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal
similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision.
Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS
across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary
method.

*Xiaochen Zhao,Hongyi Xu,Guoxian Song,You Xie,Chenxu Zhang,Xiu Li,Linjie Luo,Jinli Suo,Yebin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-NeMo is a zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation pipeline that uses motion from a driving video to animate a static portrait effectively while addressing identity leakage and expression issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors highlight limitations in previous methods, such as identity leakage and difficulties in capturing subtle and extreme facial expressions during animation.

Method: X-NeMo utilizes an end-to-end approach, employing a 1D identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor distilled from the driving image to control motion using cross-attention during image generation. It also incorporates a dual GAN decoder and various augmentations to enhance expressiveness and mitigate identity leakage.

Result: The pipeline markedly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating animations that are expressive and retain strong identity resemblance.

Conclusion: X-NeMo provides a novel, effective solution for zero-shot portrait animation by overcoming key challenges in prior methods, and its code and models are accessible for further research.

Abstract: We propose X-NeMo, a novel zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation
pipeline that animates a static portrait using facial movements from a driving
video of a different individual. Our work first identifies the root causes of
the key issues in prior approaches, such as identity leakage and difficulty in
capturing subtle and extreme expressions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D
identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively
controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our
implicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail,
learned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained
motion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion
latents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN
decoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving
motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention
rather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission
of spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion
backbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly
expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. Our code and models
are available for research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a neural inverse rendering method that reconstructs geometry, reflectance, and lighting without relying on traditional normal maps or light calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in multi-view photometric stereo methods, such as dependency on light calibration or intermediate cues for scene reconstruction.

Method: Geometry and reflectance are modeled using neural implicit fields, leveraging shadow-aware volume rendering and networks to accurately predict signed distances and reflectance latents conditioned on scene specifics.

Result: The proposed method surpasses existing normal-guided techniques in estimating shape and lighting, achieving better generalization for multi-light images and handling complex object details.

Conclusion: The research offers a robust, joint optimization approach for inverse rendering, advancing accuracy and usability in scenarios with intricate geometry, reflectance, and lighting conditions.

Abstract: We propose a neural inverse rendering approach that jointly reconstructs
geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from
multi-view images captured under varying directional lighting. Unlike prior
multi-view photometric stereo methods that require light calibration or
intermediate cues such as per-view normal maps, our method jointly optimizes
all scene parameters from raw images in a single stage. We represent both
geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and apply shadow-aware
volume rendering. A spatial network first predicts the signed distance and a
reflectance latent code for each scene point. A reflectance network then
estimates reflectance values conditioned on the latent code and angularly
encoded surface normal, view, and light directions. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided approaches in shape and lighting
estimation accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned multi-light images, and
handles objects with challenging geometry and reflectance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel image restoration network to tackle rain streak removal in single images, focusing on preserving structural details and enhancing visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complex challenge of single-image rain streak removal while preserving object boundaries and fine textures.

Method: The study introduces a Corner Loss to retain details, alongside an R-CBAM Block in the encoder and decoder to dynamically prioritize affected regions in spatial and channel dimensions.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior PSNR results on Rain100L (33.29 dB) and Rain100H (26.16 dB), outperforming previous approaches.

Conclusion: The novel network effectively improves rain streak removal, balancing detail preservation and overall visual restoration.

Abstract: The problem of single-image rain streak removal goes beyond simple noise
suppression, requiring the simultaneous preservation of fine structural details
and overall visual quality. In this study, we propose a novel image restoration
network that effectively constrains the restoration process by introducing a
Corner Loss, which prevents the loss of object boundaries and detailed texture
information during restoration. Furthermore, we propose a Residual
Convolutional Block Attention Module (R-CBAM) Block into the encoder and
decoder to dynamically adjust the importance of features in both spatial and
channel dimensions, enabling the network to focus more effectively on regions
heavily affected by rain streaks. Quantitative evaluations conducted on the
Rain100L and Rain100H datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving a PSNR of 33.29 dB on
Rain100L and 26.16 dB on Rain100H.

*Shiyao Yu,Zi-An Wang,Kangning Yin,Zheng Tian,Mingyuan Zhang,Weixin Si,Shihao Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a 4-modal framework (text, audio, video, motion) for motion retrieval, improving user interaction and performance through fine-grained sequence-level contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion retrieval methods lack intuitive user interaction and ignore the sequential representation of modalities, limiting retrieval performance.

Method: The authors introduce a framework that aligns text, audio, video, and motion in a joint embedding space using sequence-level contrastive learning, enhancing multi-modal integration.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 25.43% improvement on metrics like R@1 in video-to-motion retrieval and 10.16% in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval.

Conclusion: The inclusion of audio in a 4-modal framework significantly improves motion retrieval's precision and user immersion, emphasizing the value of multi-modal approaches in this domain.

Abstract: Motion retrieval is crucial for motion acquisition, offering superior
precision, realism, controllability, and editability compared to motion
generation. Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a
unified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality.
However, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode
and often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for
improved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a
framework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion --
within a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first
time in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This
fine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning
approach, which captures critical details across modalities for better
alignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets
with synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion
retrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16%
improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in
R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset. Furthermore, our
results show that our 4-modal framework significantly outperforms its 3-modal
counterpart, underscoring the potential of multi-modal motion retrieval for
advancing motion acquisition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the shortage of suitable datasets for segmenting flooded areas in satellite imagery by identifying gaps and introducing a novel dataset.

Method: The dataset was collected from Planet Explorer and covers 50 locations across five states with uniform resolution and resizing. Models were tested for semantic segmentation along with an ablation study varying temporal window sizes.

Result: The tested state-of-the-art computer vision and remote sensing models performed modestly, indicating room for improvement in leveraging multimodal and temporal learning strategies.

Conclusion: The dataset fills the existing gap and provides opportunities for improving flood segmentation tasks, prompting future research in temporal and multimodal methods for better performance.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel dataset for segmenting flooded areas in
satellite images. After reviewing 77 existing benchmarks utilizing satellite
imagery, we identified a shortage of suitable datasets for this specific task.
To fill this gap, we collected satellite imagery of the 2019 Midwestern USA
floods from Planet Explorer by Planet Labs (Image \c{opyright} 2024 Planet Labs

both flooded and non-flooded areas. We selected ten locations from each of the
five states: Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The dataset
ensures uniform resolution and resizing during data processing. For evaluating
semantic segmentation performance, we tested state-of-the-art models in
computer vision and remote sensing on our dataset. Additionally, we conducted
an ablation study varying window sizes to capture temporal characteristics.
Overall, the models demonstrated modest results, suggesting a requirement for
future multimodal and temporal learning strategies. The dataset will be

### [109] [Adversarial-Guided Diffusion for Multimodal LLM Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23202)
*Chengwei Xia,Fan Ma,Ruijie Quan,Kun Zhan,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adversarial-guided diffusion approach (AGD) to create adversarial images targeting multimodal large language models (MLLMs), injecting semantics into diffusion noise for improved attack effectiveness and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to develop a method for constructing adversarial images that can deceive multimodal large language models without heavily distorting the original clean image, addressing limitations in existing attack methods.

Method: The AGD method incorporates adversarial-guided noise into the reverse diffusion process of a diffusion model, embedding target semantics directly into the noise and leveraging full-spectrum properties to ensure attack efficacy while preserving robustness.

Result: AGD demonstrated superior attack performance and resistance to defenses, including low-pass filtering, compared to state-of-the-art adversarial methods during extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed AGD method successfully embeds adversarial semantics into image noise, providing robust adversarial attacks against MLLMs that withstand various defense mechanisms and outperform other approaches.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a
diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into
generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the
clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided
diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce
adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our
design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed
high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target
semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added
noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial
signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.
Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a
linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying
defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each
component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to
be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD
inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as
in model robustness to some defenses.

*Xiaoyu Ji,Ali Shakouri,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting food crystal agglomeration in microscopic images using a novel combination of supervised learning models for segmentation and classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of food crystal agglomeration in microscopic images is challenging due to transparency of water bonding and limited perspective focus.

Method: The authors developed a supervised baseline segmentation model which generates pseudo-labels and an instance classification model that performs simultaneous pixel-wise segmentation. A post-processing module is used to preserve crystal properties.

Result: Their approach improves true positive classification accuracy and size distribution predictions compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully handles variability in manual annotation confidence and enhances agglomeration classification and prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Food crystal agglomeration is a phenomenon occurs during crystallization
which traps water between crystals and affects food product quality. Manual
annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is particularly difficult
due to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective focusing
on a single slide of the imaged sample. To address this challenge, we first
propose a supervised baseline model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels for
the coarsely labeled classification dataset. Next, an instance classification
model that simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation is trained. Both
models are used in the inference stage to combine their respective strengths in
classification and segmentation. To preserve crystal properties, a post
processing module is designed and included to both steps. Our method improves
true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution
predictions compared to other existing methods. Given the variability in
confidence levels of manual annotations, our proposed method is evaluated under
two confidence levels and successfully classifies potential agglomerated
instances.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces YOLO-ROC, a lightweight and accurate road damage detection model addressing multi-scale feature extraction and computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for road damage detection struggle with multi-scale feature extraction and high computational costs, limiting their real-time application.

Method: The paper proposes YOLO-ROC, which integrates the BMS-SPPF module for enhanced multi-scale feature extraction and a hierarchical channel compression strategy to reduce model complexity.

Result: In experiments, YOLO-ROC achieved 67.6% mAP50, a 2.11% improvement over YOLOv8n, excelled in detecting small targets, and reduced model size to 2.0 MB.

Conclusion: YOLO-ROC offers a precise, real-time viable solution for road damage detection, demonstrating significant performance and size efficiency advantages.

Abstract: Road damage detection is a critical task for ensuring traffic safety and
maintaining infrastructure integrity. While deep learning-based detection
methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the
inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for
diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for
small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and
computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for
efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road
Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial
Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to
reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional
spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets.
Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from
3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the
RDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of
67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the
small-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only
2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on
the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.

Abstract: As augmented reality (AR) becomes increasingly integrated into everyday life,
ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of its virtual content is critical. Our
research addresses the risks of task-detrimental AR content, particularly that
which obstructs critical information or subtly manipulates user perception. We
developed two systems, ViDDAR and VIM-Sense, to detect such attacks using
vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules. Building on
this foundation, we propose three future directions: automated, perceptually
aligned quality assessment of virtual content; detection of multimodal attacks;
and adaptation of VLMs for efficient and user-centered deployment on AR
devices. Overall, our work aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned
framework for safeguarding AR experiences and seeks feedback on perceptual

adaptation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework, Generalized Semi-FSCIL, to handle unlabeled samples from both base and novel classes, addressing practical challenges. The proposed method, ALDC, achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning to more realistic settings by including unlabeled data from both base and all previously encountered classes, rather than limiting it to novel classes in current sessions.

Method: Redefines Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL and proposes Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC), which leverages data from base classes to correct biases in feature distributions for novel classes.

Result: The proposed ALDC method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing approaches on three benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: By introducing GSemi-FSCIL and the ALDC strategy, the study addresses practical challenges in semi-supervised incremental learning and significantly enhances model performance, broadening the applicability of FSCIL in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new
concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist
models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of
Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However,
these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined
to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective
and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world
scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by
incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled
set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge
for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples
from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an
Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC
dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions
for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that
our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing queries to retrieve effective external knowledge for RAG systems in diverse and unstructured documents remains challenging.

Method: RL-QR uses reinforcement learning with Generalized Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to align query rewriting with specific retrievers, without relying on human-labeled data.

Result: RL-QR achieved 11% improvement in NDCG@3 for multi-modal retrievers and 9% gain for lexical retrievers, but found limitations with semantic and hybrid retrievers.

Conclusion: RL-QR provides scalable query optimization for RAG systems, especially for multi-modal and lexical databases, while indicating directions for improving semantic retrieval alignment.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query
formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse,
unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce
\textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query
rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends
applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing
scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization
(GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing
retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house
data demonstrate significant improvements, with
$\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3
for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for
lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid
retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to
training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to
revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable,
annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying
avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

Motivation: Mapping cranial nerve pathways from diffusion MRI is essential for preoperative analysis but challenging due to their unique anatomy and the complex skull base environment.

Method: The study employs multi-stage fiber clustering for tractography of CN pathways using approximately 1,000,000 streamlines from 50 Human Connectome Project subjects and validates the atlas across datasets, including clinical cases, for automated identification of CN pathways.

Result: The proposed CN atlas demonstrates high spatial correspondence with manual expert annotations and successfully identifies 8 fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, showing robustness across datasets.

Conclusion: This work offers an automated, robust, and efficient CN tractography atlas, advancing diffusion imaging and facilitating enhanced visualization of brain structures and their relationships to surrounding anatomy.

Abstract: Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of
the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides
valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between
individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed
CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN
pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present
what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion
tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The
CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by
multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable
clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for
multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50
subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual
experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence
with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP
dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of
pituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8
fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II,
oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear
nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work
contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient
and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing
the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through
visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive review of generic object tracking methods, emphasizing transformer-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generic object tracking faces challenges due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, such as occlusions and appearance variations.

Result: The study highlights the innovations, limitations, and benchmarks of tracking methods, emphasizing advancements in transformer-based tracking.

Conclusion: Transformer-based methods represent a significant evolution in object tracking due to their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.

Abstract: Generic object tracking remains an important yet challenging task in computer
vision due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, especially in the presence of
occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance variations. Over the past two
decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers,
discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based
approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few
existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single
category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper
presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular
emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core
design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both
qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel
categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of
representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from
multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks,
highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven
by their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.

### [117] [Towards Measuring and Modeling Geometric Structures in Time Series Forecasting via Image Modality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23253)
*Mingyang Yu,Xiahui Guo,Peng chen,Zhenkai Li,Yang Shu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents TGSI, a metric to evaluate geometric structure in time series data, and SATL as a training loss to enhance structural modeling for better forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical metrics like MSE fail to capture geometric structure and temporal dynamics in time series data, which are crucial for understanding and forecasting.

Method: The paper introduces TGSI by transforming time series into images for geometric evaluation and SATL, which combines first-order difference loss, frequency domain loss, and perceptual feature loss to enhance structural modeling during training.

Result: Models trained using SATL showed better performance in traditional numerical metrics (MSE) and the proposed TGSI across various datasets.

Conclusion: The combination of SATL and TGSI provides more robust evaluations of time series dynamics, improving forecasting accuracy without added computational cost during inference.

Abstract: Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather
forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional
numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise
accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,
which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we
propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation
metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent
two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image
transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly
integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal
Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series
modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.
SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures
structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a
frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast
Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that
measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal
features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal
feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior
performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline
methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

### [118] [Learning Semantic-Aware Threshold for Multi-Label Image Recognition with Partial Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23263)
*Haoxian Ruan,Zhihua Xu,Zhijing Yang,Guang Ma,Jieming Xie,Changxiang Fan,Tianshui Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses multi-label image recognition with partial labels, introducing a novel Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm to dynamically calculate category-specific thresholds based on score distributions, outperforming traditional methods in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve accuracy in multi-label image recognition tasks when training with partial labels, addressing limitations of traditional pseudo-label generation methods that fail due to varying score distributions.

Method: The paper introduces Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL), which dynamically calculates category-specific thresholds based on score distributions for positive and negative samples. These thresholds are updated throughout learning, along with a differential ranking loss to create a gap between positive and negative samples' distributions.

Result: Experiments on large datasets like Microsoft COCO and VG-200 show SATL's superior performance compared to existing methods, particularly in scenarios with limited labels.

Conclusion: The SATL algorithm effectively enhances multi-label image recognition with partial labels by addressing challenges in threshold determination, proving its value in real-world applications with limited labeling.

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL) is designed to
train models using a mix of known and unknown labels. Traditional methods rely
on semantic or feature correlations to create pseudo-labels for unidentified
labels using pre-set thresholds. This approach often overlooks the varying
score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete
pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance. In our study, we introduce the
Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm. This innovative approach
calculates the score distribution for both positive and negative samples within
each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these
distributions. These distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated
throughout the learning process. Additionally, we implement a differential
ranking loss to establish a significant gap between the score distributions of
positive and negative samples, enhancing the discrimination of the thresholds.
Comprehensive experiments and analysis on large-scale multi-label datasets,
such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200, demonstrate that our method significantly
improves performance in scenarios with limited labels.

### [119] [PixNerd: Pixel Neural Field Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23268)
*Shuai Wang,Ziteng Gao,Chenhui Zhu,Weilin Huang,Limin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PixelNerd, a new diffusion transformer structure that avoids using VAEs by applying neural fields for efficient, single-stage modeling within the pixel space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are issues with the traditional use of VAEs in diffusion transformers, including accumulated errors and artifacts. Alternative solutions in pixel space usually rely on complicated cascades or increased complexity, necessitating a more elegant and efficient approach.

Method: The authors propose PixelNerd, which replaces VAEs with a single-scale, single-stage approach that employs neural field representations for pixel-wise diffusion modeling.

Result: PixelNerd achieved impressive scores: 2.15 FID on ImageNet at 256x256, 2.84 FID at 512x512, and showed competitive results in text-to-image applications, including a 0.73 overall score on GenEval and an 80.9 score on DPG benchmarks.

Conclusion: PixelNerd presents an efficient and effective solution for pixel-space diffusion without relying on VAEs or complex cascading, achieving state-of-the-art results in both image generation and text-to-image applications.

Abstract: The current success of diffusion transformers heavily depends on the
compressed latent space shaped by the pre-trained variational autoencoder(VAE).
However, this two-stage training paradigm inevitably introduces accumulated
errors and decoding artifacts. To address the aforementioned problems,
researchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines
and increased token complexity. In contrast to their efforts, we propose to
model the patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale,
single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field
diffusion~(PixelNerd). Thanks to the efficient neural field representation in
PixNerd, we directly achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.84 FID
on ImageNet $512\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. We also
extend our PixNerd framework to text-to-image applications. Our PixNerd-XXL/16
achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9
overall score on the DPG benchmark.

### [120] [Towards Affordable Tumor Segmentation and Visualization for 3D Breast MRI Using SAM2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23272)
*Solha Kang,Eugene Kim,Joris Vankerschaver,Utku Ozbulak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of SAM2, a general-purpose AI model, for low-cost and minimally supervised 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the labor-intensive and subjective nature of manual 3D breast MRI interpretation and the limited accessibility of commercial AI tools in low- and middle-income countries.

Method: They use SAM2 with a single bounding box annotation to propagate tumor segmentations through 3D scans using three strategies: top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top, and center-outward.

Result: The center-outward propagation strategy resulted in the most consistent and accurate tumor segmentations. SAM2 performed well despite not being trained specifically for volumetric medical data.

Conclusion: General-purpose models like SAM2 can provide effective, low-cost 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, making them suitable for resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor
assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans
remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for
accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products
remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,
proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate
whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,
minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box
annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D
volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,
bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large
cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most
consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not
trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation
performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation
performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure
modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2
can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an
accessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.

### [121] [iLRM: An Iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23277)
*Gyeongjin Kang,Seungtae Nam,Xiangyu Sun,Sameh Khamis,Abdelrahman Mohamed,Eunbyung Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes iLRM, an efficient 3D reconstruction method, that improves scalability and rendering quality while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address scalability and computational expense in feed-forward 3D modeling, especially in transformer-based approaches used for 3D reconstruction.

Method: The method employs iterative refinement and introduces three principles: decoupling scene representation from input images, reducing computational cost with a two-stage attention mechanism, and injecting high-resolution details at every layer.

Result: iLRM achieves superior 3D reconstruction quality and speed, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on datasets like RE10K and DL3DV.

Conclusion: iLRM delivers high-quality, scalable 3D reconstruction under comparable computational costs, making it ideal for applications requiring a large number of input views.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and
high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D
representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant
attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous
applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on
transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they
rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution
increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we
introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D
Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by
three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view
images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional
multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce
computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every
layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely
used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms
existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM
exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction
quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger
number of input views.

*Jinshan Zhen,Yuanyue Ge,Tianxiao Zhu,Hui Zhao,Ya Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a vision-based pipeline using RGB-D sensing and deep learning techniques for real-time and non-destructive mass estimation of strawberries under field conditions, addressing challenges such as occlusions and pose variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate mass estimation of strawberries under field conditions is difficult due to issues like frequent occlusions and varied poses, necessitating a robust non-destructive method for automated harvesting and yield monitoring.

Method: The study employs YOLOv8-Seg for segmentation, CycleGAN for completing occluded regions, tilt-angle correction for frontal projection refinement, and polynomial regression for mapping geometric features to mass.

Result: Experiments showed mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated strawberries and 10.47% for occluded ones, with CycleGAN outperforming LaMa in occlusion recovery metrics such as pixel area ratio and intersection over union (IoU).

Conclusion: The proposed approach mitigates limitations of traditional methods and provides an effective solution for mass estimation, improving automation in strawberry harvesting and yield monitoring even under challenging field conditions.

Abstract: Accurate mass estimation of table-top grown strawberries under field
conditions remains challenging due to frequent occlusions and pose variations.
This study proposes a vision-based pipeline integrating RGB-D sensing and deep
learning to enable non-destructive, real-time and online mass estimation. The
method employed YOLOv8-Seg for instance segmentation, Cycle-consistent
generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for occluded region completion, and
tilt-angle correction to refine frontal projection area calculations. A
polynomial regression model then mapped the geometric features to mass.
Experiments demonstrated mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated
strawberries and 10.47% for occluded cases. CycleGAN outperformed large mask
inpainting (LaMa) model in occlusion recovery, achieving superior pixel area
ratios (PAR) (mean: 0.978 vs. 1.112) and higher intersection over union (IoU)
scores (92.3% vs. 47.7% in the [0.9-1] range). This approach addresses critical
limitations of traditional methods, offering a robust solution for automated
harvesting and yield monitoring with complex occlusion patterns.

### [123] [UniLiP: Adapting CLIP for Unified Multimodal Understanding, Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23278)
*Hao Tang,Chenwei Xie,Xiaoyi Bao,Tingyu Weng,Pandeng Li,Yun Zheng,Liwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniLIP, an extension of CLIP that excels at image reconstruction, generation, and editing, without compromising comprehension performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in previous CLIP-based methods that require extra components for generation and reconstruction, often leading to diminished comprehension capabilities.

Method: Introduces a two-stage training scheme and self-distillation strategy for reconstruction integration into CLIP. Proposes a dual-condition architecture merging MLLM and diffusion transformer for optimal generation and editing tasks.

Result: UniLIP surpasses state-of-the-art models in text-to-image generation and image editing benchmarks like GenEval, WISE, and ImgEdit.

Conclusion: UniLIP significantly expands CLIP's application scope, achieving strong efficiency in both comprehension and creative tasks while eliminating performance inconsistencies found in older methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction,
generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its
exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods
often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support
reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or
degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a
two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively
integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain
original comprehension performance while achieving effective image
reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to
connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and
the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not
only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in
generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information
in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks,
UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark
respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image
editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark,
surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP
effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP
features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but
also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

### [124] [Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with Multi-Modal Large Language Models for Text-Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23284)
*Dohwan Ko,Ji Soo Lee,Minhyuk Choi,Zihang Meng,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses candidate prior bias in text-video retrieval by introducing Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation (BLiM) and Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), achieving significant improvements and broad applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome candidate prior bias in text-video retrieval and enhance query-candidate relevance.

Method: Proposed Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation (BLiM) and Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN) to balance query and candidate likelihoods.

Result: BLiM with CPN achieved a 6.4 R@1 improvement on average across benchmarks, outperforming previous state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: BLiM and CPN enhance text-video retrieval while addressing candidate prior bias, proving effective and applicable across other multi-modal tasks.

Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate
given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work
leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval,
especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that
the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood,
introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher
priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel
retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM),
which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to
generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text.
Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet
effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate
prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks,
our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4
R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing
query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal
tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances
visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors. Code is available

TL;DR: This paper introduces RAGNet, a large-scale benchmark for robotic affordance segmentation, and AffordanceNet, a grasping framework leveraging reasoning-based affordance data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve open-world generalization in robotic grasping systems by addressing the lack of reasoning-based large-scale affordance data.

Method: The authors constructed the RAGNet dataset with 273k diverse images and reasoning-based human instructions, and developed AffordanceNet, combining a VLM pre-trained on RAGNet and a grasping network using affordance maps.

Result: Experiments demonstrated AffordanceNet's strong generalization ability in open-world scenarios and improved performance in both segmentation tasks and real-robot manipulation.

Conclusion: RAGNet and AffordanceNet contribute significant advances to the field of robotic affordance segmentation and grasping, enhancing open-world capabilities through reasoning-rich datasets and frameworks.

Abstract: General robotic grasping systems require accurate object affordance
perception in diverse open-world scenarios following human instructions.
However, current studies suffer from the problem of lacking reasoning-based
large-scale affordance prediction data, leading to considerable concern about
open-world effectiveness. To address this limitation, we build a large-scale
grasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like
instructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k
reasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as
wild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully
annotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions
is largely increased by removing their category name and only providing
functional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive
affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a
VLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that
conditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on
affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that
our model has a powerful open-world generalization ability. Our data and code
is available at https://github.com/wudongming97/AffordanceNet.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Layout Error Detection (LED), a benchmark for evaluating structural errors in document layout predictions, and provides a dataset (LED-Dataset) with realistic errors for experimentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evaluation metrics like IoU and mAP are insufficient for identifying critical structural errors in document layout predictions.

Method: The authors define LED with eight error types, three tasks (error existence detection, error type classification, element-wise error classification), and create a dataset using synthetic errors based on layout model outputs.

Result: LED highlights structural understanding limitations in LMMs, exposing biases and performance trade-offs not seen with traditional metrics.

Conclusion: LED is a crucial benchmark for assessing structural robustness in document layout models, enabling better detection and analysis of layout errors.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis through Large Language Models
and Multimodal Models have significantly improved layout detection. However,
despite these improvements, challenges remain in addressing critical structural
errors, such as region merging, splitting, and missing content. Conventional
evaluation metrics like IoU and mAP, which focus primarily on spatial overlap,
are insufficient for detecting these errors. To address this limitation, we
propose Layout Error Detection (LED), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
the structural robustness of document layout predictions. LED defines eight
standardized error types, and formulates three complementary tasks: error
existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type
classification. Furthermore, we construct LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset
generated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical
distributions from DLA models. Experimental results across a range of LMMs
reveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding
capabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible
through traditional metrics.

*Hanshen Zhu,Zhen Zhu,Kaile Zhang,Yiming Gong,Yuliang Liu,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FreeFine, a decoupled pipeline for geometric image editing involving repositioning, reshaping, and reorienting objects while maintaining scene consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based editing methods struggle with demanding transformations due to attempting all editing subtasks in a single step.

Method: The decoupled pipeline separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and target region refinement, leveraging a training-free diffusion approach called FreeFine.

Result: FreeFine demonstrates superior image fidelity and edit precision, especially for complex transformations, as validated on the GeoBench benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses challenges in geometric image editing and provides improved performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We tackle the task of geometric image editing, where an object within an
image is repositioned, reoriented, or reshaped while preserving overall scene
coherence. Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all
relevant subtasks in a single step, proving difficult when transformations
become large or structurally complex. We address this by proposing a decoupled
pipeline that separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and
target region refinement. Both inpainting and refinement are implemented using
a training-free diffusion approach, FreeFine. In experiments on our new
GeoBench benchmark, which contains both 2D and 3D editing scenarios, FreeFine
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity, and edit
precision, especially under demanding transformations. Code and benchmark are

*Xihang Hu,Fuming Sun,Jiazhe Liu,Feilong Xu,Xiaoli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ST-SAM is a new framework for semi-supervised camouflaged object detection that achieves state-of-the-art performance using only 1% labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of high annotation costs, prediction bias, error propagation, and computational overhead in existing SSCOD methods.

Method: ST-SAM uses a single-model architecture enhanced by self-training and high-confidence pseudo-label filtering. It incorporates hybrid prompts to utilize the Segment Anything Model's capabilities for better detection.

Result: ST-SAM surpasses existing SSCOD methods and achieves performance comparable to fully supervised methods, even with minimal labeled data.

Conclusion: The framework introduces an efficient and scalable approach for SSCOD, setting a new standard for annotation-efficient detection methods.

Abstract: Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) aims to reduce reliance
on costly pixel-level annotations by leveraging limited annotated data and
abundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSCOD methods based on
Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error
propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures
incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise
framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically,
ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands
high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby
fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by
transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific
knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential
for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training.
Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing
SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM
requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or
loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient
SSCOD. Codes will be available at https://github.com/hu-xh/ST-SAM.

### [129] [PriorFusion: Unified Integration of Priors for Robust Road Perception in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23309)
*Xuewei Tang,Mengmeng Yang,Tuopu Wen,Peijin Jia,Le Cui,Mingshang Luo,Kehua Sheng,Bo Zhang,Diange Yang,Kun Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PriorFusion, a framework for improving road element perception in autonomous driving by integrating various structured priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate road perception in complex autonomous driving environments, especially without high-definition maps, motivated the research.

Method: PriorFusion integrates semantic, geometric, and generative priors using an instance-aware attention mechanism and a data-driven shape template space in a diffusion-based prediction framework.

Result: Experiments on large-scale datasets show significant improvements in road perception accuracy, particularly in challenging conditions.

Conclusion: PriorFusion effectively enhances the accuracy, regularity, and coherence of road element perception, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: With the growing interest in autonomous driving, there is an increasing
demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies. In complex
environments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must
independently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust
decision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to
the large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements.
A key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation
of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in
irregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a
unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and
generative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an
instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then
construct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional
representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points
as reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these
prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions. Experiments on
large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging
conditions. Visualization results further confirm that our approach produces
more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

*Timm Hess,Gido M van de Ven,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies how merging models affects continual learning, finding it generally retains shared knowledge but compromises task-specific knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of model merging on continual learning, especially in preserving shared and task-specific knowledge.

Method: Computer vision experiments with controlled visual cues to compare merging effects in incremental versus parallel training.

Result: Shared knowledge is preserved or improved via merging, while task-specific knowledge degrades. Incremental training merges perform better than parallel ones.

Conclusion: Merging models is beneficial for shared knowledge in CL, but incremental training yields superior merging outcomes.

Abstract: This paper investigates the linear merging of models in the context of
continual learning (CL). Using controlled visual cues in computer vision
experiments, we demonstrate that merging largely preserves or enhances shared
knowledge, while unshared task-specific knowledge rapidly degrades. We further
find that merging models from an incremental training process consistently
outperforms merging models trained in parallel.

### [131] [The Cow of Rembrandt - Analyzing Artistic Prompt Interpretation in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23313)
*Alfio Ferrara,Sergio Picascia,Elisabetta Rocchetti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines how transformer-based text-to-image diffusion models internally represent artistic concepts like content and style, using attention heatmaps for analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image diffusion models show impressive capabilities, but their internal mechanisms for encoding content and style in art remain unexplored.

Method: The analysis uses cross-attention heatmaps to trace pixel influences, isolating regions affected by content-describing versus style-describing tokens.

Result: Findings suggest that diffusion models distinguish content and style to varying degrees, with content influencing objects and style focusing on backgrounds and textures.

Conclusion: The study uncovers an emergent understanding of content-style distinctions in diffusion models, enhancing our knowledge of their internal representations without explicit supervision.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including
popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models
internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains
unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are
orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this
distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based
text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when
generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels
in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image
regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of
content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style
requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related
regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an
emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights
contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally
represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the
code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention
maps at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation.

*Vineet Kumar Rakesh,Soumya Mazumdar,Tapas Samanta,Sarbajit Pal,Amitabha Das*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effects of hyperparameter tuning on the accuracy and efficiency of seven lightweight deep learning models for real-time image classification on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to optimize lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models for efficient performance in resource-constrained environments such as embedded systems and edge devices.

Method: Seven efficient models are systematically trained and analyzed on the ImageNet-1K dataset, with consistent training settings and an ablation study of critical hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and data augmentation.

Result: RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80% Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, and critical hyperparameter adjustment significantly improves both accuracy and convergence speed.

Conclusion: The findings offer practical guidance for designing resource-efficient deep learning models and optimizing hyperparameters for real-time image processing in edge applications.

Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for
real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as
embedded systems and edge devices. This work analyzes the influence of
hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven
efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT
v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are
trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an
emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is
undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including
learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation,
regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for
real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and
Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter
count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge
deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and
adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,
while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80%
Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling
balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results
give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning
models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines. All code and

*Jiajun Cao,Qizhe Zhang,Peidong Jia,Xuhui Zhao,Bo Lan,Xiaoan Zhang,Xiaobao Wei,Sixiang Chen,Zhuo Li,Yang Wang,Liyun Li,Xianming Liu,Ming Lu,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FastDriveVLA, a framework for vision token pruning in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving, achieving state-of-the-art results with reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems require efficient scene understanding and action reasoning, but current visual token pruning methods perform poorly in this domain due to excessive computational costs and lack of focus on essential visual information.

Method: The method involves using FastDriveVLA with ReconPruner, a plug-and-play visual token pruner that utilizes adversarial foreground-background reconstruction to retain foreground visual tokens. It leverages a MAE-style pixel reconstruction and uses a novel dataset, nuScenes-FG, for training.

Result: FastDriveVLA showed state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark while maintaining efficiency through effective token pruning.

Conclusion: ReconPruner enables scalable token pruning for autonomous driving VLA models, reducing computational costs and improving performance by prioritizing essential foreground areas.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential
in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their
increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long
visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current
visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either
visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor
performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers
concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that
retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for
effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel
reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for
autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner
called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style
pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction
strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models.
Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models
with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also
introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K
image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across
different pruning ratios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FASTopoWM, a framework for bird's-eye view lane segment topology reasoning that leverages fast-slow systems with latent world models to overcome limitations of prior methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in lane detection and perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lane topology methods lack efficient use of temporal data for enhanced detection, suffering from issues like reliance on historical queries, pose failure vulnerabilities, and limited propagation.

Method: A fast-slow reasoning approach with latent world models is employed. The framework enables parallel supervision of historical and new queries, and incorporates latent query and BEV world models conditioned on action latent for better state propagation.

Result: FASTopoWM significantly outperformed previous methods on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark, achieving 37.4% mAP in lane segment detection and 46.3% OLS in centerline perception.

Conclusion: FASTopoWM offers an innovative approach to lane topology reasoning by mitigating pose estimation flaws and enhancing temporal perception, making it a valuable module for end-to-end autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV)
road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in
planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology
reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal
information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently,
stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by
incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it
remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose
estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology
reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of
pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision
of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual
reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce
latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate
the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This
design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the
slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate
that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment
detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%
on OLS).

*Yingkai Wang,Yaoyao Zhu,Xiuding Cai,Yuhao Xiao,Haotian Wu,Yu Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel domain generalization framework for medical image segmentation, leveraging implicit feature perturbations to enhance robustness against domain-specific variations, supported by experiments confirming its superiority over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation faces challenges from domain shifts caused by variations in imaging conditions, scanners, and acquisition protocols. These shifts hinder model performance in unseen clinical domains.

Method: The method involves using a learnable semantic direction selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to adjust domain-variant features while maintaining anatomical consistency. Additionally, an adaptive consistency constraint is introduced to ensure stabilized feature selection.

Result: Experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing domain generalization techniques, providing robust segmentation across various clinical domains.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses domain shift challenges in medical image segmentation by modulating domain-specific features and enforcing stability, making it a promising solution for generalizable clinical applications.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, but
domain shift often leads to performance degradation when models are applied to
unseen clinical domains. This challenge arises due to variations in imaging
conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical
deployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images
typically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with
domain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique
characteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.
  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework
tailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to
domain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided
by domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction
selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate
domain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency.
Furthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively
applied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation
performance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the
original predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the
reliability of the segmentation.
  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches,
achieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse
clinical domains.

*Qiang Lu,Waikit Xiu,Xiying Li,Shenyu Hu,Shengbo Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper improves traffic sign recognition by combining advanced detection and multimodal learning methods, tackling challenges of imbalanced datasets and small-scale features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to address issues in traffic sign recognition caused by long-tail data distributions and difficulties in multi-scale feature extraction.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage framework: NanoVerse YOLO for traffic sign detection and TSR-MCL for classification using visual and semantic learning.

Result: The proposed method achieves 78.4% mAP for detection and 91.8% accuracy in classification on the TT100K dataset.

Conclusion: This innovative approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, advancing recognition accuracy and generalization in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition, as a core component of autonomous driving
perception systems, directly influences vehicle environmental awareness and
driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first,
the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution,
resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional
convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution
classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small
targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract
multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage
framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For
traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable
vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to
specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For
traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal
Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a
Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL
learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating
class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for
all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall,
significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior
accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for robust road surface reconstruction, integrating occlusion-aware Gaussian surfels and semantic-guided enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of occlusion, clutter, and appearance degradation in urban road surface reconstruction for autonomous driving.

Method: The approach uses planar-adapted Gaussian representations, segmentation-guided video inpainting, and semantic-aware color correction in HSV space.

Result: Achieves superior road surface reconstructions in real-world urban datasets, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves visual coherence and geometric accuracy for autonomous road modeling in challenging environments.

Abstract: Road surface reconstruction is essential for autonomous driving, supporting
centimeter-accurate lane perception and high-definition mapping in complex
urban environments.While recent methods based on mesh rendering or 3D Gaussian
splatting (3DGS) achieve promising results under clean and static conditions,
they remain vulnerable to occlusions from dynamic agents, visual clutter from
static obstacles, and appearance degradation caused by lighting and weather
changes. We present a robust reconstruction framework that integrates
occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to
recover clean, consistent road surfaces. Our method leverages a planar-adapted
Gaussian representation for efficient large-scale modeling, employs
segmentation-guided video inpainting to remove both dynamic and static
foreground objects, and enhances color coherence via semantic-aware correction
in HSV space. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate that
our framework produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful
reconstructions, significantly outperforming prior methods under real-world
conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines how input image resolution affects the performance of face detectors YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and MTCNN. YOLOv11 excels in accuracy at higher resolutions, YOLOv12 is slightly better in recall, and MTCNN is slower despite its landmark localization strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how low-resolution imagery impacts the effectiveness of AI-based face detectors in real-world applications.

Method: Evaluations conducted across multiple image resolutions using the WIDER FACE dataset, measuring performance via metrics like precision, recall, and mAP.

Result: YOLOv11 demonstrated superior accuracy at higher resolutions, YOLOv12 showed better recall, and MTCNN performed slower despite competitive landmark localization.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of choosing appropriate resolution-aware face detection models based on operational needs and constraints.

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new dataset, THQA-10K, to evaluate the quality of AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) from 12 Text-to-Image models and 14 talkers, alongside proposing a new quality assessment method producing state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing interest in speech-driven portrait generation ("Talkers") and AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs), but existing methods face quality challenges, and comprehensive quality studies are limited.

Method: The paper introduces THQA-10K, a dataset generated using 12 T2I models and 14 talkers for 14 prompts, containing 10,457 AGTHs after filtering. The dataset uses subjective ratings from volunteers and analyzes generalizability, quality, and distortions of AGTHs.

Result: The authors proposed a novel objective quality assessment methodology leveraging the first frame, Y-T slice, and tone-lip consistency, achieving state-of-the-art performance in AGTH quality evaluation.

Conclusion: THQA-10K provides a benchmark for understanding and improving AGTH quality, and the proposed method demonstrates its utility in advancing quality evaluation techniques in the field.

Abstract: Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as "Talkers"
because of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial
movements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I)
models, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging
digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these
talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these
issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest
AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent
T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After
excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset
contains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the
AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for
subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in
terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of
existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the
first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental
results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze how key design patterns have evolved in computer vision through the study of influential architectures and techniques.

Method: Examines six pivotal techniques: ResNet, Vision Transformer (ViT), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), DINO (self-supervised learning), and Masked Autoencoders (MAE).

Result: ResNet addressed vanishing gradients; ViT applied Transformer models; GANs introduced adversarial training; LDMs achieved computational efficiency in synthesis; DINO showcased the power of student-teacher models; MAE advanced scalable pre-training with an encoder-decoder setup.

Conclusion: The evolution of design patterns in computer vision has significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in image recognition, generation, and self-supervised learning, setting the stage for future innovations.

Abstract: This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision
by examining six influential papers. The analy- sis begins with foundational
architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced
residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable
effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.
Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new
paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image
patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale
image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we
investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are
analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a
generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative
methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually
compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater
computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image
generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce
dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a
student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher,
yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with
Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design
to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective
method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper identifies challenges in applying layer pruning to large vision-language models (LVLMs) and introduces the Short-LVLM framework to overcome these issues, enhancing efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of LVLMs caused by massive parameters and computational costs while exploring whether NLP's layer pruning techniques remain effective for LVLMs.

Method: The authors conducted extensive experiments to pinpoint challenges in pruning LVLM layers due to modality divergence, proposing the Short-LVLM framework that leverages essential VL tokens and reduces layer-wise feature gaps.

Result: Short-LVLM achieves better efficiency-performance trade-offs, is training-free, model-agnostic, and highly compatible, showcasing significant advantages over existing methods.

Conclusion: The study provides empirical evidence that standard NLP pruning techniques are unsuitable for LVLMs but offers a novel and effective solution through Short-LVLM.

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical
applications are still limited by massive model parameters and high
computational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have
shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free
compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision
and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in
LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer
pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find
that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps
pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL
tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only
achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also
exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and
highly compatible. The code for this work is publicly available at

TL;DR: This paper presents VMatcher, a hybrid network combining Mamba and Transformer mechanisms for efficient, semi-dense feature matching in images. It achieves robust, real-time performance with lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs of Transformer-based feature matching methods necessitate exploring more efficient architectures without sacrificing performance.

Method: The VMatcher integrates Mamba's linear complexity Selective State-Space Model (SSM) with the Transformer's attention mechanism in a hybrid configuration. Hierarchical architectures are proposed for better efficiency and robustness.

Result: VMatcher sets new benchmarks in semi-dense feature matching by achieving similar or superior performance to existing methods while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The hybrid VMatcher approach is effective for real-time applications, balancing computational efficiency with high robustness and practicality for semi-dense feature matching tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces VMatcher, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network for
semi-dense feature matching between image pairs. Learning-based feature
matching methods, whether detector-based or detector-free, achieve
state-of-the-art performance but depend heavily on the Transformer's attention
mechanism, which, while effective, incurs high computational costs due to its
quadratic complexity. In contrast, Mamba introduces a Selective State-Space
Model (SSM) that achieves comparable or superior performance with linear
complexity, offering significant efficiency gains. VMatcher leverages a hybrid
approach, integrating Mamba's highly efficient long-sequence processing with
the Transformer's attention mechanism. Multiple VMatcher configurations are
proposed, including hierarchical architectures, demonstrating their
effectiveness in setting new benchmarks efficiently while ensuring robustness
and practicality for real-time applications where rapid inference is crucial.

*Yijie Zhu,Lingsen Zhang,Zitong Yu,Rui Shao,Tao Tan,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniEmo, a unified framework for emotional understanding and generation, combining the strengths of both tasks through multi-scale emotional feature extraction and joint training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotional understanding and generation are complementary tasks, but existing approaches treat them separately, limiting their collective potential.

Method: The authors designed a hierarchical chain with learnable expert queries to extract emotional features, combined them to guide a diffusion model for generating emotion-evoking images, and used a joint training approach with feedback loops.

Result: UniEmo achieved significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in emotional understanding and generation tasks, verified through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: By aligning emotional understanding and generation in a unified framework and leveraging mutual feedback, UniEmo enhances accuracy, diversity, and fidelity in emotional AI tasks.

Abstract: Emotional understanding and generation are often treated as separate tasks,
yet they are inherently complementary and can mutually enhance each other. In
this paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of
emotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for
both tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding
chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale
emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.
Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to
guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the
diversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce
the emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the
fusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional
generation guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint
training allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the
understanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to
select high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained

*Haoran Chen,Zexiao Wang,Haidong Cao,Zuxuan Wu,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MP²A, a method for progressively aligning domains using CLIP for unsupervised domain adaptation, resulting in improved performance on key benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to unsupervised domain adaptation using CLIP struggle with error propagation due to noisy pseudo-labels and face greater instability in multi-source scenarios.

Method: The proposed method, MP²A, progressively aligns domains by training on high-confidence target data initially and gradually incorporating harder samples to reduce noise and promote robust learning.

Result: MP²A achieves state-of-the-art performance on UDA benchmarks including ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and DomainNet, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: Progressive alignment provides a robust framework for unsupervised domain adaptation, leading to effective domain-invariant feature learning and improved benchmark results.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models like CLIP have become a powerful foundation for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation due to their strong zero-shot generalization.
State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for
the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features.
However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all
pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with
noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal
feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source
scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple
source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this
issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting
CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a
high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a
well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training
progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the
model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label
noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and
promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely
domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three
popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging
DomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art
performance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeRF-GS, combining Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for improved 3D scene representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF-GS aims to tackle limitations of 3DGS, such as sensitivity to Gaussian initialization and weak spatial correlations, by integrating NeRF's continuous spatial representation.

Method: The framework aligns spatial features between NeRF and 3DGS, optimizing them together through shared spatial information and residual vectors.

Result: NeRF-GS outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: NeRF-GS demonstrates that NeRF and 3DGS can complement each other, paving the way for efficient hybrid approaches in 3D scene representation.

Abstract: We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). This framework
leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate
several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization,
limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby
enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and
progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both
representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial
information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two
approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and
Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that
NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights
into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene
representation.

### [146] [AGA: An adaptive group alignment framework for structured medical cross-modal representation learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23402)
*Wei Li,Xun Gong,Jiao Li,Xiaobin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Grouped Alignment (AGA), a framework for learning structured semantics from paired medical images and reports without the need for external negatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in medical vision-language pretraining often oversimplify clinical reports and rely on impractical large datasets for contrastive learning, limiting their effectiveness for small-scale medical datasets.

Method: AGA employs a bidirectional grouping mechanism with sparse similarity matrices and adaptive threshold gating to pair image patches and text tokens. The learning process uses group representations and an innovative alignment loss to remove the need for external negative samples.

Result: AGA demonstrates strong performance in image-text retrieval and classification tasks across public and private datasets under fine-tuning and zero-shot conditions.

Conclusion: AGA effectively aligns structured semantics in paired medical images and reports, providing a promising solution for medical representation learning with small datasets.

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a
promising direction in representation learning. However, current
vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify
clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their
inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically
depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for
small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive
Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics
from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping
mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we
compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each
token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch
selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive
grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped
Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping
thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages
based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,
we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each
image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a
Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance
fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.
Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method
achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks
under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

*Lemar Abdi,Francisco Caetano,Amaan Valiuddin,Christiaan Viviers,Hamdi Joudeh,Fons van der Sommen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reconstruction-free method for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in medical imaging using Stein score-based denoising diffusion models (SBDDM), achieving state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of supervised OOD detection methods and inefficiencies of current generative approaches, especially for pathological cases with low incidence rates.

Method: A reconstruction-free OOD detection approach based on capturing forward diffusion trajectory curvature using Stein score in SBDDM, requiring only five diffusion steps.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on Near-OOD and Far-OOD benchmarks with up to 18.10% improvement and drastically reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: SBDDM offers a robust, efficient, and generalized framework for OOD detection, making it suitable for real-time, reliable computer-aided medical diagnosis.

Abstract: In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers
an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low
incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches
function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current
generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction
error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and
require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their
ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently,
and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that
leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising
diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated
Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five
diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned
medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD
benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing
computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM
achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and
Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable
computer-aided diagnosis.

TL;DR: The paper presents a machine learning system using hyperspectral imaging and LDA-KNN models to detect honey adulteration with a high accuracy of 96.39%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a faster, more efficient alternative to chemical-based methods for detecting honey adulteration.

Method: The system combines Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for feature extraction and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classifying honey's botanical origin and quantifying adulteration levels using a hyperspectral image dataset.

Result: Achieved a high cross-validation accuracy of 96.39% for detecting sugar syrup adulteration in honey.

Conclusion: The proposed ML-based system is a reliable and effective alternative to traditional chemical detection methods for honey adulteration.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based system for automatically
detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral
imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a
botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration
is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection
subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves
extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and
identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed
system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result
indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an
overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate
alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study enhances dual-teacher self-supervised frameworks by integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to improve art style classification, resulting in higher accuracy on datasets like WikiArt and Pandora18k.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in art style classification attributed to limited labeled datasets and complex stylistic elements often missed by existing frameworks.

Method: Introduced KANs-based replacements for linear MLP prediction heads within dual-teacher architectures to better model nonlinear feature correlations and stylistic hierarchies.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated superior Top-1 accuracy and linear probe accuracy on datasets like WikiArt and Pandora18k compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: Utilizing KANs is critical for capturing complex style-feature interactions, thereby enhancing the performance of art style classification frameworks.

Abstract: Art style classification remains a formidable challenge in computational
aesthetics due to the scarcity of expertly labeled datasets and the intricate,
often nonlinear interplay of stylistic elements. While recent dual-teacher
self-supervised frameworks reduce reliance on labeled data, their linear
projection layers and localized focus struggle to model global compositional
context and complex style-feature interactions. We enhance the dual-teacher
knowledge distillation framework to address these limitations by replacing
conventional MLP projection and prediction heads with Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs). Our approach retains complementary guidance from two teacher
networks, one emphasizing localized texture and brushstroke patterns, the other
capturing broader stylistic hierarchies while leveraging KANs' spline-based
activations to model nonlinear feature correlations with mathematical
precision. Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the base dual teacher architecture in Top-1 accuracy. Our findings
highlight the importance of KANs in disentangling complex style manifolds,
leading to better linear probe accuracy than MLP projections.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyCASS, a learning-based model for adjustable hyperspectral image compression, addressing the spectral and spatial redundancies in a comprehensive manner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing has created a demand for efficient storage solutions. Previous methods have not thoroughly examined the joint effects of spectral and spatial compression.

Method: HyCASS deploys six key modules including spectral/spatial encoders and decoders, along with CR adapter components that utilize convolutional layers and transformers to capture redundancies in hyperspectral data.

Result: Experimental results on benchmark datasets show HyCASS's superiority over existing learning-based compression models. Guidelines for balancing spectral and spatial compression across CRs are also established.

Conclusion: HyCASS offers effective adjustable compression for hyperspectral images, ensuring a balance between spectral and spatial dimensions. The code and pre-trained models are made publicly accessible.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS),
the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant
attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However,
a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral
and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been
thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for
understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint
spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we
propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network
(HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in
both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1)
spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter
encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder
module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to
capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on
two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based
on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and
spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial
resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .

Motivation: To utilize machine learning in analyzing medical images for accurate diagnosis, exploring its effectiveness in predicting patient ailments.

Method: Implemented two algorithms—baseline convolutional neural network (CNN) and DenseNet-121—on a dataset of 5824 chest X-ray images.

Result: Both algorithms performed well in binary classification, with DenseNet-121 showing better focus on essential areas in X-rays using gradient-weighted class activation mapping.

Conclusion: DenseNet-121 is more effective than the baseline CNN in focusing on crucial areas for decision-making in medical imaging.

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are fast-growing fields of
research in which data is used to train algorithms, learn patterns, and make
predictions. This approach helps to solve seemingly intricate problems with
significant accuracy without explicit programming by recognizing complex
relationships in data. Taking an example of 5824 chest X-ray images, we
implement two machine learning algorithms, namely, a baseline convolutional

machine-learned predictions in predicting patients with ailments. Both baseline
CNN and DenseNet-121 perform very well in the binary classification problem
presented in this work. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that
DenseNet-121 correctly focuses on essential parts of the input chest X-ray

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "resolution-drift" as a key challenge in applying Federated Learning (FL) to non-classification tasks like human pose estimation, and proposes a resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF) method leveraging heatmap-based knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address resolution variability issues, termed 'resolution-drift,' in FL for non-classification tasks, emphasizing the need for robust methods to handle non-IID data beyond statistical heterogeneity.

Method: The proposed method, RAF, uses multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs and lower-resolution outputs to enhance robustness to resolution drift while avoiding overfitting.

Result: RAF effectively mitigates resolution drift, achieves significant performance improvements, and integrates seamlessly with existing FL frameworks. It is shown to be generalizable to other tasks preserving spatial details.

Conclusion: The study highlights resolution as a crucial axis for non-IID data in FL and demonstrates the potential of RAF in improving human pose estimation and extending to other spatial-detail-centric tasks.

Abstract: The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across
distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has
primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication
efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks.
However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose
estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a
critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades
significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level
heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as
another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To
address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a
method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through
multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs
(teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances
resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and
theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates
resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also
can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although
this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals
distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution
representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks
that rely on preserving spatial detail.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CST Anti-UAV, a thermal infrared dataset for single object tracking of tiny UAVs in complex scenes, addressing gaps in existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of diversity and scene complexity in current UAV tracking datasets, which limits their effectiveness for real-world anti-UAV tasks.

Method: The paper presents CST Anti-UAV, a dataset of 220 video sequences with over 240k high-quality bounding box annotations featuring attributes like tiny UAVs and complex scenes. This dataset includes detailed, manually annotated attributes for precise evaluations.

Result: The study evaluates 20 state-of-the-art tracking methods using CST Anti-UAV and finds that these models struggle with tiny UAV tracking in complex environments, achieving a state accuracy of only 35.92%.

Conclusion: CST Anti-UAV exposes the limitations of existing methods and benchmarks in UAV tracking and emphasizes the need for advanced tracking techniques. The public release of CST Anti-UAV aims to foster innovation in this domain.

Abstract: The widespread application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has raised
serious public safety and privacy concerns, making UAV perception crucial for
anti-UAV tasks. However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature
conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute
representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To
overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared
dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex
Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k
high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a
significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex
scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to
incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise
evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance
analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex
environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only
35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410
dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and
the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV
benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the
development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV
systems.

reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision.
Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively
chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10%

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a significant advancement in AI-based video capsule endoscopy by integrating multi-task learning within strict resource constraints. The proposed model successfully combines efficiency, compactness, and high performance, offering promise for real-world applications.

Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has become increasingly important for investigating
the small intestine within the gastrointestinal tract. However, a persistent
challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge
devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation
by enabling intelligent real-time decision- making, thereby reducing the energy
consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging
due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the
overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that
combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the
gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small

curve, we can efficiently identify subsequent sample points without
exhaustively computing all pairwise distances. Our proposal substantially
accelerates farthest point sampling and neighbor search operations while

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel two-stage depth diffusion framework, called Stable-Sim2Real, to bridge the disparity between synthetic and real-captured 3D data, enhancing real-world 3D vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of narrowing the significant gap between simulated 3D data and real-captured 3D data, vital for advancing real-world 3D visual applications.

Method: The paper proposes Stable-Sim2Real, a two-stage depth diffusion model. The first stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to stabilize synthetic depth outputs, while the second stage employs a 3D discriminator to refine areas that deviate from realistic depth mapping.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate improved performance of real-world 3D vision tasks when trained on 3D simulated data generated by the proposed method. The results also show that the simulated data closely resemble real-world patterns.

Conclusion: Stable-Sim2Real effectively addresses challenges in 3D data simulation, offering a robust framework that enhances performance in 3D visual tasks, and demonstrates high alignment between simulated and real-captured data.

Abstract: 3D data simulation aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-captured
3D data, which is a fundamental problem for real-world 3D visual tasks. Most 3D
data simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to
capture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning
an implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,
but progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work
explores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called
Stable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial
stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and
synthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local
regions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the
synthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where
diffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a
3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data

the 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances

### [158] [Hyperbolic Cycle Alignment for Infrared-Visible Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23508)
*Timing Li,Bing Cao,Jiahe Feng,Haifang Cao,Qinghau Hu,Pengfei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method for multi-source image fusion called Hy-CycleAlign, which utilizes hyperbolic space for improved cross-modal image registration and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image fusion methods struggle to manage cross-modal misalignments effectively because they are typically confined to Euclidean space, resulting in suboptimal alignment and reduced fusion quality.

Method: The authors present Hy-CycleAlign, the first image registration methodology based on hyperbolic space. It uses a dual-path cyclic registration framework that enforces geometric consistency with forward and backward registration networks and integrates this with a Hyperbolic Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment module (H$^{2}$CA) to reduce modality discrepancies.

Result: Experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing approaches in terms of image alignment and fusion quality, particularly for misaligned multi-modal images.

Conclusion: This work highlights the potential of hyperbolic space for enhancing sensitive and effective multi-modal image registration and establishes Hy-CycleAlign as a promising solution for improving cross-modal image fusion accuracy.

Abstract: Image fusion synthesizes complementary information from multiple sources,
mitigating the inherent limitations of unimodal imaging systems. Accurate image
registration is essential for effective multi-source data fusion. However,
existing registration methods, often based on image translation in Euclidean
space, fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, resulting in
suboptimal alignment and fusion quality. To overcome this limitation, we
explore image alignment in non-Euclidean space and propose a Hyperbolic Cycle
Alignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign). To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign
is the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces
a dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward
registration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration
network reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration
structure with geometric consistency. Additionally, we design a Hyperbolic
Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module, which maps images into
hyperbolic space and imposes registration constraints, effectively reducing
interference caused by modality discrepancies. We further analyze image
registration in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that
hyperbolic space enables more sensitive and effective multi-modal image
registration. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
both image alignment and fusion. Our code will be publicly available.

*David A. Kelly,Akchunya Chanchal,Nathan Blake*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores how machine learning models for image classification focus on specific sets of pixels, termed minimal sufficient pixel sets, to understand their decision-making better. The analysis reveals statistical differences in pixel focus among architectures and links misclassified images with larger pixel sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the growing number of image classification models, understanding their decision-making processes and differences between architectures is essential. This research aims to shed light on how models interpret pixel-based image data.

Method: The study analyzes the position, overlap, and size of minimal sufficient pixel sets required by various vision models to capture the essence of an image. Statistical comparisons among different architectures, like ConvNext and EVA, are conducted.

Result: The research shows that models like ConvNext and EVA have distinct patterns in focusing on pixels compared to other architectures. Additionally, misclassified images require larger pixel sets, indicating these models struggle more with certain images.

Conclusion: Minimal sufficient pixel sets offer valuable insights into how different vision models function. Understanding these differences can improve model selection and address weaknesses, such as those causing misclassifications.

Abstract: Machine learning for image classification is an active and rapidly developing
field. With the proliferation of classifiers of different sizes and different
architectures, the problem of choosing the right model becomes more and more
important.
  While we can assess a model's classification accuracy statistically, our
understanding of the way these models work is unfortunately limited. In order
to gain insight into the decision-making process of different vision models, we
propose using minimal sufficient pixels sets to gauge a model's
`concentration': the pixels that capture the essence of an image through the
lens of the model. By comparing position, overlap, and size of sets of pixels,
we identify that different architectures have statistically different
concentration, in both size and position. In particular, ConvNext and EVA
models differ markedly from the others. We also identify that images which are
misclassified are associated with larger pixels sets than correct
classifications.

### [160] [ART: Adaptive Relation Tuning for Generalized Relation Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23543)
*Gopika Sudhakaran,Hikaru Shindo,Patrick Schramowski,Simone Schaub-Meyer,Kristian Kersting,Stefan Roth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ART, a framework using instruction tuning and adaptive sampling to improve Visual Relation Detection (VRD) in vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VRD models trained on specific data struggle with generalizing to unseen or complex relationships. Current methods like prompt tuning also fail in handling novel relations.

Method: ART combines instruction tuning of vision-language models with an adaptive instance selection strategy, converting VRD datasets into suitable formats for better focus on informative relations.

Result: ART performs substantially better than baselines in relation classification tasks and can generalize to unseen relation concepts, demonstrating its efficacy.

Conclusion: ART offers a significant improvement in VRD by addressing limitations of current methods, with promising applications such as scene segmentation.

Abstract: Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships
between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection
data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained.
While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for
VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations.
We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by
fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an
Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction
tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an
instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART
directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining
generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where
subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between
them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets
of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and
can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD
methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations
for segmenting complex scenes.

TL;DR: This paper introduces 3D-MOOD, the first end-to-end monocular open-set 3D object detection method, addressing real-world cases involving unseen scenes and objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular 3D object detection methods are limited to closed-set scenarios, but real-world applications often demand open-set capabilities to detect novel objects and scenes.

Method: The method elevates 2D open-set detection into 3D space using a specialized 3D bounding box head, geometry-conditioned object queries, and canonical image space for effective cross-dataset training.

Result: 3D-MOOD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both closed-set and open-set scenarios across evaluations on Omni3D, Argoverse 2, and ScanNet datasets.

Conclusion: 3D-MOOD demonstrates robust generalization and improved performance for monocular 3D object detection in diverse real-world environments.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is valuable for various applications such as
robotics and AR/VR. Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where
the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object
categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments
and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this
paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and
introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD).
We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed
3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D
tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with
geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse
scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for
more efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set
settings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and
achieve new state-of-the-art results. Code and models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a hybrid scene representation, leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting for improved and privacy-preserving visual localization, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a visual localization approach that combines accuracy with privacy by improving scene representation utilizing 3D models.

Method: The paper proposes GSFFs, a combination of 3D Gaussian Splatting for explicit geometric representation and feature fields. It employs a contrastive framework to align 3D scale-aware features with 2D encoders in a shared space, with added privacy-preserving clustering and segmentation techniques.

Result: The proposed GSFFs-based method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both privacy-preserving and non-privacy-preserving visual localization pipelines across multiple real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GSFFs effectively bridge dense geometric information with robust feature representation, ensuring both high accuracy and privacy capabilities in visual localization tasks.

Abstract: Visual localization is the task of estimating a camera pose in a known
environment. In this paper, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based
representations for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization. We
propose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for
visual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an
implicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and
differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature
representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware
feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a
contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we
further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the
features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual
localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or
segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene
representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and
non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world
datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.

TL;DR: BeyondGloss introduces a gloss-free framework for Sign Language Translation using Video Large Language Models, employing innovative methods for temporal reasoning and alignment to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in Sign Language Translation by bridging visual-linguistic modality gaps and ensuring accurate capture of hand dynamics.

Method: Proposes a gloss-free SLT framework leveraging VideoLLMs, generating temporally-aware textual hand motion descriptions, aligning them contrastively with video features, and using HaMeR for feature distillation.

Result: BeyondGloss achieves state-of-the-art results on the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, showing significant enhancement in performance.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges modality gaps and enhances fine-grained hand-specific temporal dynamics in sign language translation.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that requires bridging
the modality gap between visual and linguistic information while capturing
subtle variations in hand shapes and movements. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages
the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models
(VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail,
we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual
descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these
descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to
focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively.
To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained
features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign
video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap
in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MamV2XCalib, an autonomous vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2X) camera calibration method leveraging vehicle-side LiDAR, eliminating the need for manual intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for large-scale, precise, and efficient calibration of infrastructure cameras for autonomous systems, as traditional methods are time-consuming and disruptive.

Method: MamV2XCalib uses vehicle-side LiDAR to calibrate roadside cameras without specific reference objects or manual setup. It integrates a new targetless calibration method using multi-scale features, 4D correlation volumes, and models temporal information to address data defects in V2X scenarios.

Result: MamV2XCalib demonstrated effective and robust calibration performance on real-world datasets (V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X), outperforming traditional LiDAR-camera calibration approaches in V2X settings.

Conclusion: MamV2XCalib provides a more stable and efficient calibration system for V2X scenarios with fewer parameters, offering an automated solution for large-scale infrastructure camera calibration tasks.

Abstract: As cooperative systems that leverage roadside cameras to assist autonomous
vehicle perception become increasingly widespread, large-scale precise
calibration of infrastructure cameras has become a critical issue. Traditional
manual calibration methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may
require road closures. This paper proposes MamV2XCalib, the first V2X-based
infrastructure camera calibration method with the assistance of vehicle-side
LiDAR. MamV2XCalib only requires autonomous vehicles equipped with LiDAR to
drive near the cameras to be calibrated in the infrastructure, without the need
for specific reference objects or manual intervention. We also introduce a new
targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method, which combines multi-scale features
and a 4D correlation volume to estimate the correlation between vehicle-side
point clouds and roadside images. We model the temporal information and
estimate the rotation angles with Mamba, effectively addressing calibration
failures in V2X scenarios caused by defects in the vehicle-side data (such as
occlusions) and large differences in viewpoint. We evaluate MamV2XCalib on the
V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness
and robustness of our V2X-based automatic calibration approach. Compared to
previous LiDAR-camera methods designed for calibration on one car, our approach
achieves better and more stable calibration performance in V2X scenarios with
fewer parameters. The code is available at

*Zijian Dong,Longteng Duan,Jie Song,Michael J. Black,Andreas Geiger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoGA, a novel method to create high-fidelity 3D Gaussian avatars from single images by addressing realism and consistency challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors sought to overcome the limitations of previous methods for 3D avatar creation, which faced issues like sparse and inconsistent view generation, leading to unrealistic artifacts.

Method: They developed MoGA, which integrates a generative avatar model for sampling deformable Gaussians and combines this with constraints from 2D diffusion models to improve 3D consistency.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that MoGA outperforms state-of-the-art methods and efficiently generalizes to real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: MoGA is a significant advancement in 3D avatar reconstruction, achieving realistic results and ensuring the avatars remain animatable.

Abstract: We present MoGA, a novel method to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian
avatars from a single-view image. The main challenge lies in inferring unseen
appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism.
Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views;
however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in
unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations,
we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by
sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the
limited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all
image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior,
ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and
enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel
approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by
fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The
generative avatar provides a meaningful initialization for model fitting,
enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose estimation. Experiments
show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well
to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable

*Yuchen Zhou,Yan Luo,Xiangang Wang,Xingjian Gu,Mingzhou Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a 2D approach for 3D occupancy prediction that balances high accuracy with real-time performance for autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D occupancy prediction often sacrifice inference speed for accuracy, making them unsuitable for real-time autonomous driving.

Method: The method slices 3D voxel features to preserve vertical geometry and employs a directional attention mechanism to extract features from multiple orientations, achieving efficiency and accuracy.

Result: The proposed method achieves 39.3% mIoU at 27.7 FPS on Occ3D-nuScenes and 14.8 FPS on edge devices, demonstrating a balance of accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The approach is shown to be both accurate and efficient, making it suitable for real-time autonomous driving, even on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Efficient and high-accuracy 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for ensuring
the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, many current
methods focus on high accuracy at the expense of real-time processing needs. To
address this challenge of balancing accuracy and inference speed, we propose a
directional pure 2D approach. Our method involves slicing 3D voxel features to
preserve complete vertical geometric information. This strategy compensates for
the loss of height cues in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representations, thereby
maintaining the integrity of the 3D geometric structure. By employing a
directional attention mechanism, we efficiently extract geometric features from
different orientations, striking a balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency. Experimental results highlight the significant advantages of our
approach for autonomous driving. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method
achieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively
balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the
inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's
applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.

*Xin Li,Keren Fu,Qijun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vcamba, a novel method for video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) that combines spatial and frequency-based features to improve performance and reduce computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of existing VCOD methods that rely heavily on spatial appearance features, which struggle to differentiate between foreground and background due to high similarity.

Method: The proposed method uses several innovative modules, including RFVSS for spatial feature extraction, AFE for frequency enhancement, SLMP and FLMP for motion modeling, and SFMF for integrating spatial and frequency features into a unified representation.

Result: Vcamba achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across 6 metrics on 2 datasets, while also being computationally more efficient.

Conclusion: Integrating spatial and frequency domains into unified motion modeling enhances VCOD, offering both higher accuracy and lower computational demand, making Vcamba a promising approach.

Abstract: Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on
spatial appearance features to perceive motion cues for breaking camouflage.
However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results
in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and
texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies
demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation
to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through
dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space
model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame
sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated
by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on
spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial
features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive
field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features
after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive
frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain
sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose
a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based
long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and
frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally,
the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain
features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our
Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2
datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.

TL;DR: The MIDI-B Challenge establishes a benchmark for de-identifying DICOM images using synthetic data, with top scores close to 100% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure HIPAA-compliant de-identification of medical images while preserving metadata crucial for AI research in biomedical fields.

Method: A three-phase challenge (training, validation, test) with real de-identified radiology images containing synthetic PHI/PII to evaluate various deID tools.

Result: Ten teams achieved scores ranging from 97.91% to 99.93%, utilizing a mix of open-source, proprietary tools, and advanced techniques like OCR and large language models.

Conclusion: The challenge demonstrated the effectiveness of current deID tools and provided a standardized platform for their evaluation, with significant lessons for future development and research in medical imaging.

Abstract: The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and
personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for
sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure
compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI
metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial
intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The
goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM
image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor
regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in
preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and
multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic
PHI/PII inserted.
  The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and
test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase,
we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or
public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images
containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten
teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure
success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the
percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The
scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of
open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large
language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we
provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design,
implementation, results, and lessons learned.

*Yucheng Xie,Fu Feng,Ruixiao Shi,Jing Wang,Yong Rui,Xin Geng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DivControl is a framework for controllable image generation that achieves high performance with less training and strong adaptability to new conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for image generation struggle with poor generalization and high adaptation costs when incorporating structured inputs like depth maps.

Method: DivControl decomposes ControlNet using SVD to separate representations into condition-agnostic and condition-specific components, employs a dynamic gate for soft routing, and uses representation alignment loss to improve fidelity and efficiency.

Result: DivControl significantly reduces training costs (36.4x less) while delivering state-of-the-art performance in controllability, scalability, and adaptability to unseen conditions.

Conclusion: The framework achieves superior controllability, efficiency, and generalization, paving the way for scalable and modular image generation models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-image
(I2I) generation by incorporating structured inputs such as depth maps,
enabling fine-grained spatial control. However, existing methods either train
separate models for each condition or rely on unified architectures with
entangled representations, resulting in poor generalization and high adaptation
costs for novel conditions. To this end, we propose DivControl, a decomposable
pretraining framework for unified controllable generation and efficient
adaptation. DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into basic
components-pairs of singular vectors-which are disentangled into
condition-agnostic learngenes and condition-specific tailors through knowledge
diversion during multi-condition training. Knowledge diversion is implemented
via a dynamic gate that performs soft routing over tailors based on the
semantics of condition instructions, enabling zero-shot generalization and
parameter-efficient adaptation to novel conditions. To further improve
condition fidelity and training efficiency, we introduce a representation
alignment loss that aligns condition embeddings with early diffusion features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivControl achieves state-of-the-art
controllability with 36.4$\times$ less training cost, while simultaneously
improving average performance on basic conditions. It also delivers strong
zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen conditions, demonstrating superior
scalability, modularity, and transferability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT) for few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS), with improvements tailored for small object tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FS-CS methods achieve high accuracy but struggle with small object classification and segmentation, despite the need for efficient and accurate performance, particularly with few annotated data examples.

Method: It introduces EMAT with three key features: a memory-efficient masked attention mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter efficiency, while also proposing new evaluation settings that utilize previously discarded annotations.

Result: EMAT surpasses state-of-the-art FS-CS methods on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$, achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

Conclusion: EMAT provides an effective solution for FS-CS, especially in handling small object challenges, reducing parameter requirements, and introducing practical evaluation settings for better real-world applicability.

Abstract: Few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS) focuses on jointly
performing multi-label classification and multi-class segmentation using few
annotated examples. Although the current state of the art (SOTA) achieves high
accuracy in both tasks, it struggles with small objects. To overcome this, we
propose the Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT), which improves
classification and segmentation accuracy, especially for small objects. EMAT
introduces three modifications: a novel memory-efficient masked attention
mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency
enhancements. EMAT outperforms all FS-CS methods on the PASCAL-5$^i$ and
COCO-20$^i$ datasets, using at least four times fewer trainable parameters.
Moreover, as the current FS-CS evaluation setting discards available
annotations, despite their costly collection, we introduce two novel evaluation
settings that consider these annotations to better reflect practical scenarios.

Motivation: Training SNNs efficiently is challenging due to their non-differentiability and computational demands of conventional approaches, limiting accuracy and deployment feasibility on edge devices.

Method: The paper proposes a Forward-Forward (FF) training framework that treats spiking activations as black-box modules, eliminating gradient approximations. It further incorporates a class-aware complexity adaptation mechanism for optimized resource allocation.

Result: The framework achieved test accuracies of 99.58% (MNIST), 92.13% (Fashion-MNIST), and 75.64% (CIFAR-10), outperforming existing FF-based SNN methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed FF-based gradient-free training framework significantly improves SNN training efficiency, accuracy, and energy consumption, addressing key deployment challenges.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible framework for
energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. However, it is a challenge to train
SNNs due to their non-differentiability, efficiently. Existing gradient
approximation approaches frequently sacrifice accuracy and face deployment
limitations on edge devices due to the substantial computational requirements
of backpropagation. To address these challenges, we propose a Forward-Forward
(FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for Spiking Neural
Networks, which treats spiking activations as black-box modules, thereby
eliminating the need for gradient approximation while significantly reducing
computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a class-aware complexity
adaptation mechanism that dynamically optimizes the loss function based on
inter-class difficulty metrics, enabling efficient allocation of network
resources across different categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed training framework achieves test accuracies of 99.58%, 92.13%, and
75.64% on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively,
surpassing all existing FF-based SNN approaches. Additionally, our proposed
method exhibits significant advantages in terms of memory access and
computational power consumption.

*Kunpeng Qiu,Zhiying Zhou,Yongxin Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Adaptively Distilled ControlNet, a privacy-preserving framework that uses dual-model distillation to improve medical image segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation models for medical images are limited by privacy issues and the difficulty of labeling, thus requiring frameworks to address these challenges.

Method: The framework adopts dual-model distillation, where a teacher model conditions on mask-image pairs to regularize a mask-only student model, with adaptive regularization based on lesion-background ratios.

Result: The framework demonstrates state-of-the-art improvements in segmentation benchmarks: notable mDice/mIoU gains on KiTS19 and Polyps datasets.

Conclusion: Using the Adaptively Distilled ControlNet during sampling allows for effective medical image generation while preserving privacy, and it achieves superior segmentation metrics in evaluations.

Abstract: Medical image annotation is constrained by privacy concerns and
labor-intensive labeling, significantly limiting the performance and
generalization of segmentation models. While mask-controllable diffusion models
excel in synthesis, they struggle with precise lesion-mask alignment. We
propose \textbf{Adaptively Distilled ControlNet}, a task-agnostic framework
that accelerates training and optimization through dual-model distillation.
Specifically, during training, a teacher model, conditioned on mask-image
pairs, regularizes a mask-only student model via predicted noise alignment in
parameter space, further enhanced by adaptive regularization based on
lesion-background ratios. During sampling, only the student model is used,
enabling privacy-preserving medical image generation. Comprehensive evaluations
on two distinct medical datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance:
TransUNet improves mDice/mIoU by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19, while SANet achieves
2.6%/3.5% gains on Polyps, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority. Code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model designed for zero-shot transfer in human trajectory prediction across varying temporal dynamics. It achieves state-of-the-art performance both pre-trained and fine-tuned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models face challenges in zero-shot transfer due to inconsistent frame rates and observation horizons in human trajectory prediction datasets. This limits their scalability and usefulness.

Method: The paper proposes conditioning mechanisms for temporal metadata and introduces OmniTraj, a Transformer model pre-trained on diverse datasets with explicit conditioning on frame rates.

Result: OmniTraj demonstrates a reduction of prediction error by over 70% in zero-shot cross-scenario setups and achieves state-of-the-art results after fine-tuning on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Explicit conditioning on temporal metadata can significantly enhance generalization, as demonstrated by OmniTraj, making it effective and scalable for trajectory prediction in diverse setups.

Abstract: While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a
critical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying
temporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require
fine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation
horizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we
systematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We
first demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when
transferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the
temporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit
conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution.
Based on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model
pre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that
explicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve
state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by
over 70\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj
achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA,
WorldPose, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available:

Motivation: Hyperspectral imaging in medical applications faces challenges due to restricted data availability and hardware variations.

Method: SAMSA utilizes user-guided clicks to direct both RGB-based segmentation and spectral similarity calculations. It integrates spectral feature fusion strategies to overcome limitations in band count and resolution.

Result: On neurosurgical datasets, SAMSA achieved 81.0% DICE with 1 click and 93.4% DICE with 5 clicks. In the intraoperative porcine hyperspectral dataset, it recorded 81.1% DICE (1 click) and 89.2% DICE (5 clicks).

Conclusion: SAMSA effectively addresses segmentation challenges in hyperspectral imaging, proving its adaptability in scenarios with minimal training data and diverse spectral dataset integration.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for medical
imaging, yet encounters significant challenges due to data limitations and
hardware variations. We introduce SAMSA, a novel interactive segmentation
framework that combines an RGB foundation model with spectral analysis. SAMSA
efficiently utilizes user clicks to guide both RGB segmentation and spectral
similarity computations. The method addresses key limitations in HSI
segmentation through a unique spectral feature fusion strategy that operates
independently of spectral band count and resolution. Performance evaluation on
publicly available datasets has shown 81.0% 1-click and 93.4% 5-click DICE on a
neurosurgical and 81.1% 1-click and 89.2% 5-click DICE on an intraoperative
porcine hyperspectral dataset. Experimental results demonstrate SAMSA's
effectiveness in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios and using minimal
training examples. Our approach enables seamless integration of datasets with
different spectral characteristics, providing a flexible framework for
hyperspectral medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents I2V-GS, a novel method for transforming infrastructure views into vehicle views to create autonomous driving datasets, showcasing significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current driving data collection methods using vehicles are costly and inefficient, prompting the need for a synthesis approach using real-world images.

Method: The paper proposes I2V-GS, which employs adaptive depth warp, cascade inpainting strategies, and confidence-guided optimization using cross-view information.

Result: I2V-GS surpasses StreetGaussian, achieving 45.7% improvement in NTA-Iou, 34.2% in NTL-Iou, and 14.9% in FID metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework achieves high-quality synthesis of vehicle views from infrastructure viewpoints and sets a groundbreaking standard for autonomous driving dataset generation.

Abstract: Vast and high-quality data are essential for end-to-end autonomous driving
systems. However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which
is expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data
from real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate
photorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating
driving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel
method, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with
Gaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and
rendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt
the adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the
range of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which
also ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure
the reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information
to perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a
multi-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views.
To our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving
datasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation. Experimental results
demonstrate that I2V-GS significantly improves synthesis quality under vehicle
view, outperforming StreetGaussian in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID by 45.7%,
34.2%, and 14.9%, respectively.

Motivation: The motivation is to advance All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR), which faces challenges in managing diverse degradations effectively.

Method: A framework built on latent diffusion models (LDMs) is designed, incorporating a Degradation-Aware Feature Fusion (DAFF) module to handle diverse degradations and a Detail-Aware Expert Module (DAEM) to recover textures and fine details.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in various multi-task and mixed degradation settings, confirming its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The integration of diffusion priors with novel modules shows great practical potential for unified image restoration tasks, with plans to release the code for further use.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) has emerged as a promising yet
challenging research direction. To address its core challenges, we propose a
novel unified image restoration framework based on latent diffusion models
(LDMs). Our approach structurally integrates low-quality visual priors into the
diffusion process, unlocking the powerful generative capacity of diffusion
models for diverse degradations. Specifically, we design a Degradation-Aware
Feature Fusion (DAFF) module to enable adaptive handling of diverse degradation
types. Furthermore, to mitigate detail loss caused by the high compression and
iterative sampling of LDMs, we design a Detail-Aware Expert Module (DAEM) in
the decoder to enhance texture and fine-structure recovery. Extensive
experiments across multi-task and mixed degradation settings demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
practical potential of diffusion priors for unified image restoration. Our code
will be released.

*Zhenyang Li,Xiaoyang Bai,Tongchen Zhang,Pengfei Shen,Weiwei Xu,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FlowGaussian-VR, a velocity field modeling approach for better video reconstruction using optical flow optimization and adaptive densification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address visual quality issues in 3D video reconstruction caused by overfitting in deformation networks and inadequate handling of dynamic content.

Method: The authors propose two innovations: velocity field rendering (VFR) using optical flow-based optimization and flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) to adjust Gaussians in dynamic regions.

Result: The model achieves over 2.5 dB improvement in PSNR, reduces blurry artifacts, and generates regularized, trackable Gaussian trajectories.

Conclusion: FlowGaussian-VR enhances video reconstruction for multi-view dynamic scenes, showing significant improvement in visual quality and dynamic texture handling.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is essential for enabling real-time
rendering of dynamic scenes with realistic motion in virtual and augmented
reality (VR/AR). The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has
achieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great
representation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with
complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often
overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual
quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for
static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic
content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity
field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed
FlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering
(VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a
flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and
size of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on
multi-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple
real-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not
only notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry
artifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian
trajectories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This work proposes a new technique to improve explainability in image classification models by incorporating risk estimation into pixel attribution methods, validated on pCLE data and ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image classification explainability methods using pixel attribution suffer from overconfidence in model predictions and the associated pixel attribution values.

Method: The method develops enhanced pixel attribution (PA) maps by iteratively creating a volume of PA maps, generating pixel-wise distributions, estimating expectation values, and using coefficient of variation (CV) to calculate pixel-wise risk.

Result: The proposed method produces enhanced PA maps and risk estimations and demonstrates superior performance in explainability compared to existing methods on pCLE data and ImageNet.

Conclusion: The work advances image classification explainability by integrating risk measures, improving both the reliability and utility of pixel attribution methods in intraoperative decision-making.

Abstract: The deployment of Machine Learning models intraoperatively for tissue
characterisation can assist decision making and guide safe tumour resections.
For image classification models, pixel attribution methods are popular to infer
explainability. However, overconfidence in deep learning model's predictions
translates to overconfidence in pixel attribution. In this paper, we propose
the first approach which incorporates risk estimation into a pixel attribution
method for improved image classification explainability. The proposed method
iteratively applies a classification model with a pixel attribution method to
create a volume of PA maps. This volume is used for the first time, to generate
a pixel-wise distribution of PA values. We introduce a method to generate an
enhanced PA map by estimating the expectation values of the pixel-wise
distributions. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to
estimate pixel-wise risk of this enhanced PA map. Hence, the proposed method
not only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on
the output PA values. Performance evaluation on probe-based Confocal Laser
Endomicroscopy (pCLE) data and ImageNet verifies that our improved
explainability method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

*Emery Pierson,Lei Li,Angela Dai,Maks Ovsjanikov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-driven approach to functional maps for non-rigid shape correspondence, replacing conventional axiomatic models with a trained generative model using score-based diffusion in the spectral domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep functional map methods rely too much on axiomatic models for regularization and training loss, limiting accuracy and applicability.

Method: The approach involves training a score-based generative model of functional maps in the spectral domain and utilizing it to enforce structural properties on new data.

Result: The learned model outperforms traditional axiomatic regularization strategies and achieves better results in zero-shot non-rigid shape matching.

Conclusion: Data-driven generative models in the spectral domain can fully replace axiomatic approaches, marking an advancement for general and accurate non-rigid shape correspondence.

Abstract: Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving
non-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine
the power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven
learning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods
in this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and
still rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for
functional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the
accuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios
where assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the
first time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can
be replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative
model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative
modeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit
the resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth
functional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the
learned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used
strategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of
functional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation
strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate
that our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic
approaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching. Our code is available at:

*Rongzhen Zhao,Yi Zhao,Juho Kannala,Joni Pajarinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DIAS, an improved Slot Attention mechanism for Object-Centric Learning that addresses slot redundancy and improves supervision through re-initialization and self-distillation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work is to overcome limitations of existing Object-Centric Learning methods, such as redundant slot competition and lack of supervision signals beyond input reconstruction.

Method: The authors propose DIAS, which reduces redundancy in slots by re-initializing them during slot aggregation and utilizes self-distillation by aligning initial and final attention maps to enhance model learning.

Result: DIAS achieves state-of-the-art performance in Object-Centric Learning tasks such as object discovery and recognition, along with improvements in visual prediction and reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: DIAS addresses key bottlenecks in traditional Slot Attention methods by introducing re-initialization and self-distillation mechanisms, ultimately leading to superior performance and better object-centric representations in visual tasks.

Abstract: Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning
(OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors,
termed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities.
OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying
competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the
query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing
redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This
often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally,
mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into
the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal
information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with
re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce
redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to
update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the
first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to
enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves
state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also
improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning. Our code is available on

TL;DR: The paper presents SeqAffordSplat, a benchmark for long-horizon affordance reasoning in 3D environments, and proposes SeqSplatNet, an end-to-end model for mapping instructions to sequential 3D affordance masks with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied agents require the ability to handle long-horizon, multi-object interactions in 3D environments, but existing methods are limited to single-object tasks.

Method: The study introduces SeqSplatNet, an end-to-end framework combining a large language model, geometric pre-training strategy, and semantic fusion via 2D Vision Foundation Models.

Result: SeqSplatNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SeqAffordSplat benchmark, successfully advancing from single-step to sequential affordance reasoning on complex tasks.

Conclusion: SeqSplatNet presents a significant step forward for affordance reasoning in embodied tasks, enabling sequential and multi-object interactions in 3D scenes.

Abstract: 3D affordance reasoning, the task of associating human instructions with the
functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents.
Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited
to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of
addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world
applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D
Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale
benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance
understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an
end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D
affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that
autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens,
guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle
complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional
Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete
affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a
robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design
a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision
Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art
on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from
single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model that combines SMPL-X with physics simulation to enable realistic and penetration-free physical interactions with the environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in kinematic-based 3D human models, such as interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics during interactions.

Method: Develop a 'half-physics' mechanism that combines SMPL-X kinematic poses with physics simulation, ensuring real-time operation and plausible physical interaction.

Result: The proposed method eliminates penetration issues, ensures realistic object dynamics, and generalizes across body shapes and motions without requiring complex learning frameworks.

Conclusion: This novel approach enhances SMPL-X's interaction capabilities by maintaining motion fidelity while enabling dynamic physical interactions.

Abstract: While current general-purpose 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) efficiently
represent accurate human shape and pose, they lacks the ability to physically
interact with the environment due to the kinematic nature. As a result,
kinematic-based interaction models often suffer from issues such as
interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable
of dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings. Specifically, we
propose a "half-physics" mechanism that transforms 3D kinematic motion into a
physics simulation. Our approach maintains kinematic control over inherent
SMPL-X poses while ensuring physically plausible interactions with scenes and
objects, effectively eliminating penetration and unrealistic object dynamics.
Unlike reinforcement learning-based methods, which demand extensive and complex
training, our half-physics method is learning-free and generalizes to any body
shape and motion; meanwhile, it operates in real time. Moreover, it preserves
the fidelity of the original kinematic motion while seamlessly integrating
physical interactions

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the accuracy and deployment readiness of GUI grounding models for multimodal reasoning systems, as current models struggle with performance and reliability.

Method: They conducted an empirical study on training grounding models, improving processes from data collection to model training, and developed the Phi-Ground model family.

Result: Phi-Ground models achieved state-of-the-art performance across five benchmarks and better accuracy compared to prior models in end-to-end settings.

Conclusion: The paper clarifies methodologies for constructing GUI grounding models and provides insights valuable for advancing both grounding and broader perception tasks.

Abstract: With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents
(CUAs), akin to Jarvis from \textit{"Iron Man"}, are becoming a reality. GUI
grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to
mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure
of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as
related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end
grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging
benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from
being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable
consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of
grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training.
Ultimately, we developed the \textbf{Phi-Ground} model family, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models
under $10B$ parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our
model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textit{\textbf{43.2}} on
ScreenSpot-pro and \textit{\textbf{27.2}} on UI-Vision. We believe that the
various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures,
not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view videos, addressing the limitations of dense multi-view setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing dynamic scenes from sparse-view videos addresses the prohibitive costs and in-the-wild limitations of multi-view dense captures.

Method: The method involves aligning independent monocular reconstructions from sparse-view cameras to achieve time- and view-consistent results.

Result: The approach outperforms previous techniques, demonstrating better reconstruction quality, particularly for novel view rendering, when tested on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D datasets.

Conclusion: This work makes dynamic scene reconstruction more accessible using sparse-view configurations, with promising performance and publicly available resources.

Abstract: We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view
videos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of
calibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are
prohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild.
In contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a
bike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene
coverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that
dense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view
setup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,
we carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to
produce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive
experiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method
achieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when
rendering novel views. Code, data, and data-processing scripts are available on

CBMs struggle to reliably identify the correct concepts under distribution
shifts. To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce
SUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic
images based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33
bird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific
concept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied
Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where
noise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the
correct bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel
benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models,
contributing to the development of more robust methods. Our code is available

*Bowen Zhang,Sicheng Xu,Chuxin Wang,Jiaolong Yang,Feng Zhao,Dong Chen,Baining Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework for generating high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs using a novel diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 4D diffusion modeling is challenging due to data construction costs and the complexities of representing 3D shape, appearance, and motion jointly.

Method: They propose Direct 4DMesh-to-GS Variation Field VAE combined with a Gaussian Variation Field diffusion model using a temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer.

Result: The framework achieves superior generation quality on animatable 3D objects, generalizing well to real-world videos despite being trained only on synthetic data.

Conclusion: This method showcases advancements in animatable 3D content generation, pointing towards practical applications beyond synthetic datasets.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that
creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D
diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and
the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and
motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS
Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and
their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting,
and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space.
Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation
Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on
input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D
objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation
quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable
generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on
synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

### [187] [H2SGEMM: Emulating FP32 GEMM on Ascend NPUs using FP16 Units with Precision Recovery and Cache-Aware Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23387)
*Weicheng Xue,Baisong Xu,Kai Yang,Yongxiang Liu,Dengdeng Fan,Pengxiang Xu,Yonghong Tian*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: A proposed algorithm, H2SGEMM, enables FP32 matrix-matrix multiplication using only FP16 units on AI accelerators, achieving high accuracy and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI accelerators using FP16 matrix computation engines lack native FP32 support, limiting their ability to perform full-precision operations required in applications.

Method: The FP32 values are decomposed into FP16 components, and numerical errors are mitigated using a tunable scaling strategy. Cache-aware blocking and double-buffered pipeline techniques are introduced for efficient memory-computation overlap.

Result: H2SGEMM achieves up to 77% of theoretical peak FP32-equivalent performance on AI accelerators and demonstrates superior numerical stability under specific conditions.

Conclusion: H2SGEMM not only recovers FP32-level accuracy using FP16 computation but also provides improved stability in certain numerical scenarios, offering a promising solution for AI accelerators without native FP32 support.

Abstract: Low-precision matrix engines, such as FP16 cube, offer high throughput but
lack support for full-precision computation. In this work, we propose H2SGEMM,
a high-performance algorithm for emulating FP32 general matrix-matrix
multiplication (GEMM) using only FP16 computation units on a representative AI
accelerator. The method decomposes each FP32 operand into two FP16 values and
compensates for numerical errors through a tunable scaling strategy. A detailed
analysis of numerical errors, including underflow conditions and precision
loss, guides the selection of scaling parameters to preserve up to 22 bits of
mantissa accuracy. We further investigate the effect of computation order on
accuracy and demonstrate that a term-wise accumulation scheme improves
numerical stability over conventional FP32 GEMM in low-exponent regimes.
Finally, a cache-aware blocking strategy and double-buffered pipeline are
introduced to overlap memory transfers with computation, enabling H2SGEMM to
achieve up to 77% of the theoretical FP32-equivalent peak performance on Ascend
910A NPU lacking native FP32 support. Extensive numerical experiments confirm
that our method not only recovers the accuracy of native FP32 GEMM but also
exhibits superior numerical stability under certain conditions, due to its
structured and error-aware computation order.

*Flora Angileri,Andrea Clementi,Emanuele Natale,Michele Salvi,Isabella Ziccardi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the RAES algorithm under a dynamic graph model with streaming node-churn, proving good expansion properties and efficient rumor spreading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal was to address the open question left by Becchetti et al. (SODA 2020) regarding the performance of RAES in dynamic graph models, which better represent real-world scenarios such as peer-to-peer networks.

Method: The authors consider a dynamic model based on streaming node-churn (sliding window model) and analyze the behavior and properties of RAES algorithm through probabilistic proofs and theoretical analysis.

Result: They demonstrate that the dynamic graph sequence retains high expansion properties with high probability, and rumor spreading protocols (PUSH and PULL) achieve logarithmic completion time in this setup.

Conclusion: RAES is shown to perform effectively under dynamic conditions, reinforcing its applicability to real-world scenarios like peer-to-peer networks.

Abstract: A randomized distributed algorithm called RAES was introduced in [Becchetti
et al., SODA 2020] to extract a bounded-degree expander from a dense $n$-vertex
expander graph $G = (V, E)$. The algorithm relies on a simple threshold-based
procedure. A key assumption in [Becchetti et al., SODA 2020] is that the input
graph $G$ is static - i.e., both its vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$ remain
unchanged throughout the process - while the analysis of RAES in dynamic models
is left as a major open question.
  In this work, we investigate the behavior of RAES under a dynamic graph model
induced by a streaming node-churn process (also known as the sliding window
model), where, at each discrete round, a new node joins the graph and the
oldest node departs. This process yields a bounded-degree dynamic graph
$\mathcal{G} =\{ G_t = (V_t, E_t) : t \in \mathbb{N}\}$ that captures essential
characteristics of peer-to-peer networks -- specifically, node churn and
threshold on the number of connections each node can manage. We prove that
every snapshot $G_t$ in the dynamic graph sequence has good expansion
properties with high probability. Furthermore, we leverage this property to
establish a logarithmic upper bound on the completion time of the well-known
PUSH and PULL rumor spreading protocols over the dynamic graph $\mathcal{G}$.

### [191] [KLLM: Fast LLM Inference with K-Means Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23035)
*Xueying Wu,Baijun Zhou,Zhihui Gao,Yuzhe Fu,Qilin Zheng,Yintao He,Hai Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges of memory and computation demands in LLM inference by proposing KLLM, a co-design framework that leverages K-Means-based quantization and an efficient outlier detection engine, resulting in significant speed and energy efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of traditional uniform integer-based quantization techniques, which degrade accuracy, and address the inefficiencies of K-Means-based quantization and outlier detection methods in low-precision LLM inference.

Method: The proposed method, KLLM, features an index-based computation scheme to enable efficient operations on K-Means-quantized data and integrates an outlier detection engine, Orizuru, for identifying extreme activation values without significant runtime overhead.

Result: KLLM achieves 9.67x speedup and 229.50x energy efficiency improvements on average compared to an A100 GPU, and 7.03x speedup and 150.21x energy efficiency improvements compared to Atom.

Conclusion: KLLM demonstrates that K-Means quantization can effectively improve LLM inference performance when paired with optimized hardware-software co-design and an outlier detection mechanism.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference poses significant challenges due to its
intensive memory and computation demands. Weight and activation quantization
(WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and
arithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ
designs. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization
for hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy
degradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform
quantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like
distributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform
nature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring
dequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during
inference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ.
Offline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant
model performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques
introduce substantial runtime overhead.
  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of
WAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose
KLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based
computation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations
on K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and
full-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier
detection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and
smallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.
  Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x,
7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the
A100 GPU and Atom, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeuroAR, a novel autoregressive transformer model to synthesize brain aging trajectories based on MRI scans, outperforming existing generative models in fidelity and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in predicting future brain structural evolution from MRI scans, such as data high-dimensionality, subtle structural changes, and subject-specific patterns.

Method: The proposed method, NeuroAR, uses autoregressive transformers to simulate brain aging by estimating discrete token maps of future scans, leveraging previous and future scan token embeddings and incorporating subject-specific data like acquisition and target ages.

Result: NeuroAR demonstrates superior performance in synthesizing aging brain trajectories compared to existing models like latent diffusion models (LDM) and generative adversarial networks, achieving higher image fidelity and realistic aging patterns.

Conclusion: NeuroAR is a highly effective model for brain aging simulation, accurately modeling subject-specific aging trajectories and advancing the state-of-the-art in generative brain modeling.

Abstract: Brain aging synthesis is a critical task with broad applications in clinical
and computational neuroscience. The ability to predict the future structural
evolution of a subject's brain from an earlier MRI scan provides valuable
insights into aging trajectories. Yet, the high-dimensionality of data, subtle
changes of structure across ages, and subject-specific patterns constitute
challenges in the synthesis of the aging brain. To overcome these challenges,
we propose NeuroAR, a novel brain aging simulation model based on generative
autoregressive transformers. NeuroAR synthesizes the aging brain by
autoregressively estimating the discrete token maps of a future scan from a
convenient space of concatenated token embeddings of a previous and future
scan. To guide the generation, it concatenates into each scale the subject's
previous scan, and uses its acquisition age and the target age at each block
via cross-attention. We evaluate our approach on both the elderly population
and adolescent subjects, demonstrating superior performance over
state-of-the-art generative models, including latent diffusion models (LDM) and
generative adversarial networks, in terms of image fidelity. Furthermore, we
employ a pre-trained age predictor to further validate the consistency and
realism of the synthesized images with respect to expected aging patterns.
NeuroAR significantly outperforms key models, including LDM, demonstrating its
ability to model subject-specific brain aging trajectories with high fidelity.

Method: 69 participants performed writing tasks under three conditions (bona fide writing, paraphrasing ChatGPT, and transcribing ChatGPT responses) using cognitively diverse processes aligned with Bloom's Taxonomy, with subsequent analysis using keystroke dynamics and classifiers.

Result: Temporal features excelled in cognition-aware evaluations, while rhythmic features performed better in cross-cognition settings. Models detected bona fide and transcribed responses more effectively than paraphrased ones and outperformed human evaluators.

Conclusion: Keystroke dynamics offer reliable detection of LLM-assisted writing, accounting for diverse cognitive demands and writing strategies.

Abstract: This paper presents a keystroke-based framework for detecting LLM-assisted
cheating in Korean, addressing key gaps in prior research regarding language
coverage, cognitive context, and the granularity of LLM involvement. Our
proposed dataset includes 69 participants who completed writing tasks under
three conditions: Bona fide writing, paraphrasing ChatGPT responses, and
transcribing ChatGPT responses. Each task spans six cognitive processes defined
in Bloom's Taxonomy (remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and
create). We extract interpretable temporal and rhythmic features and evaluate
multiple classifiers under both Cognition-Aware and Cognition-Unaware settings.
Temporal features perform well under Cognition-Aware evaluation scenarios,
while rhythmic features generalize better under cross-cognition scenarios.
Moreover, detecting bona fide and transcribed responses was easier than
paraphrased ones for both the proposed models and human evaluators, with the
models significantly outperforming the humans. Our findings affirm that
keystroke dynamics facilitate reliable detection of LLM-assisted writing across
varying cognitive demands and writing strategies, including paraphrasing and
transcribing LLM-generated responses.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise orders-of-magnitude lower power
consumption and low-latency inference on neuromorphic hardware for a wide range
of robotic tasks. In this work, we present an energy-efficient implementation
of a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm using quantized SNNs to solve two
classical control tasks. The network is trained using the Q-learning algorithm,
then fine-tuned and quantized to low-bit (8-bit) precision for embedded
deployment on the SpiNNaker2 neuromorphic chip. To evaluate the comparative
advantage of SpiNNaker2 over conventional computing platforms, we analyze
inference latency, dynamic power consumption, and energy cost per inference for
our SNN models, comparing performance against a GTX 1650 GPU baseline. Our
results demonstrate SpiNNaker2's strong potential for scalable, low-energy
neuromorphic computing, achieving up to 32x reduction in energy consumption.
Inference latency remains on par with GPU-based execution, with improvements
observed in certain task settings, reinforcing SpiNNaker2's viability for
real-time neuromorphic control and making the neuromorphic approach a
compelling direction for efficient deep Q-learning.

### [195] [NaN-Propagation: A Novel Method for Sparsity Detection in Black-Box Computational Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23186)
*Peter Sharpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method called NaN-propagation to detect sparsity in black-box functions more reliably, improving speed and accuracy in gradient-based optimization by using IEEE 754 NaN contamination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing finite-difference sparsity detection methods in gradient-based optimization often fail due to false negatives caused by coincidental zero gradients, leading to potential errors.

Method: The paper proposes the NaN-propagation technique, which leverages the contamination property of IEEE 754 NaN values to identify input-output dependencies conservatively by observing how NaN values spread through computations.

Result: Applying the method to an aerospace wing weight model resulted in a 1.52x computational speedup and revealed dozens of dependencies that traditional methods missed, showcasing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The technique is robust, IEEE 754 compliant, language-agnostic, and introduces optimization in sparsity detection for gradient computation, addressing false negatives and improving upon existing solutions.

Abstract: Sparsity detection in black-box functions enables significant computational
speedups in gradient-based optimization through Jacobian compression, but
existing finite-difference methods suffer from false negatives due to
coincidental zero gradients. These false negatives can silently corrupt
gradient calculations, leading to difficult-to-diagnose errors. We introduce
NaN-propagation, which exploits the universal contamination property of IEEE
754 Not-a-Number floating-point values to trace input-output dependencies
through floating-point numerical computations. By systematically contaminating
inputs with NaN and observing which outputs become NaN, the method reconstructs
conservative sparsity patterns that eliminate false negatives. We demonstrate
the approach on an aerospace wing weight model, achieving a 1.52x speedup while
detecting dozens of dependencies missed by conventional methods -- a
significant improvement since gradient computation is the bottleneck in many
optimization workflows. The technique leverages IEEE 754 compliance to work
across programming languages and math libraries without modifying existing
black-box codes. Advanced strategies including NaN payload encoding enable
faster-than-linear time complexity, improving upon existing black-box sparsity
detection methods. Practical algorithms are also proposed to mitigate
challenges from branching code execution common in engineering applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are replacing traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) in scientific machine learning due to their better flexibility and interpretability. This review shows that KANs outperform MLPs in accuracy and efficiency while highlighting challenges and future research areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limitations in MLPs, such as poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, and difficulty in capturing localized or high-frequency features, necessitate exploring alternative architectures like KANs.

Method: The paper organizes advancements in KAN-based models into three areas: data-driven learning, physics-informed modeling, and deep operator learning. It evaluates architectural designs, training approaches, and performance benchmarks against MLPs.

Result: KANs show consistent improvements over MLPs in accuracy, convergence, and capturing spectral representations. This highlights their effectiveness in modeling complex nonlinear interactions.

Conclusion: KANs offer significant advantages over traditional MLPs but face challenges like computational efficiency and theoretical guarantees. Addressing these issues can further enhance their potential in scientific machine learning.

Abstract: The field of scientific machine learning, which originally utilized
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is increasingly adopting Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs) for data encoding. This shift is driven by the limitations of
MLPs, including poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, and
difficulty capturing localized or high-frequency features. KANs address these
issues with enhanced interpretability and flexibility, enabling more efficient
modeling of complex nonlinear interactions and effectively overcoming the
constraints associated with conventional MLP architectures. This review
categorizes recent progress in KAN-based models across three distinct
perspectives: (i) data-driven learning, (ii) physics-informed modeling, and
(iii) deep operator learning. Each perspective is examined through the lens of
architectural design, training strategies, application efficacy, and
comparative evaluation against MLP-based counterparts. By benchmarking KANs
against MLPs, we highlight consistent improvements in accuracy, convergence,
and spectral representation, clarifying KANs' advantages in capturing complex
dynamics while learning more effectively. Finally, this review identifies
critical challenges and open research questions in KAN development,
particularly regarding computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees,
hyperparameter tuning, and algorithm complexity. We also outline future
research directions aimed at improving the robustness, scalability, and
physical consistency of KAN-based frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in sequence modeling, such as streamability, correctness, and ease of development, while reducing common bugs in streaming and parallel processing.

Method: The proposed SequenceLayers API defines state representations and evolution methods for layers over time and ensures identical results for both sequential and streaming operations.

Result: SequenceLayers enables immediate streamability of complex models, simplifies construction of production-scale sequence models, and ensures correctness without sacrificing flexibility.

Conclusion: The SequenceLayers API offers a standardized approach for sequence modeling, streamlining model development with strong correctness guarantees, and is shared online for community use and further development.

Abstract: We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling,
designed for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both
layer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g.,
autoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit
representation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a
convolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that
state, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation.
This and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to
be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in
both streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any
deep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a
comprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of
production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving
strong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers
(JAX, TensorFlow 2) are available at https://github.com/google/sequence-layers.

*Boyuan Zheng,Victor W. Chu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-hazard forecasting framework for agriculture using deep learning and explainable AI (XAI) techniques to address the escalating impact of climate extremes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change intensifies agricultural risks, creating a need for intelligent early warning systems capable of continuously adapting to recent climate trends. Current single-hazard methods inadequately address the complexity of concurrent climatic interactions.

Method: The framework combines sequential deep learning models, specifically BiLSTMs, with Explainable AI tools like TimeSHAP, to analyze and predict multiple severe climate events using meteorological data from 2010-2023 in four U.S. agricultural regions.

Result: The proposed approach achieved strong predictive accuracy for extreme events (e.g., heatwaves, floods) and provided actionable insights into the timing and significance of specific climatic features.

Conclusion: This work enhances the explainability and predictive reliability of multi-hazard early warning systems, supporting better risk management and decision-making within the agricultural sector.

Abstract: Climate extremes present escalating risks to agriculture intensifying the
need for reliable multi-hazard early warning systems (EWS). The situation is
evolving due to climate change and hence such systems should have the
intelligent to continue to learn from recent climate behaviours. However,
traditional single-hazard forecasting methods fall short in capturing complex
interactions among concurrent climatic events. To address this deficiency, in
this paper, we combine sequential deep learning models and advanced Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard
forecasting framework for agriculture. In our experiments, we utilize
meteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United
States (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our
framework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods,
frost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area.
The framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a
recurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal
explanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but
precisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive
accuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's
capacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies. This research
significantly advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard
EWS, fostering interdisciplinary trust and effective decision-making process
for climate risk management in the agricultural industry.

TL;DR: FedCVD++ is a federated learning framework integrating parametric and non-parametric models for cardiovascular disease prediction, achieving high accuracy and communication efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the global burden of cardiovascular diseases and the need for privacy-preserving predictive systems in healthcare.

Method: The FedCVD++ framework integrates diverse machine learning models (logistic regression, SVM, neural networks, Random Forest, XGBoost), incorporates methods like tree-subset sampling, federated SMOTE synchronization, and XGBoost-based feature extraction to enhance performance and scalability.

Result: FedCVD++ shows state-of-the-art results with improved F1-scores for federated models (e.g., 0.80-0.81), bandwidth reduction by 3.2X, and enhanced performance compared to centralized systems.

Conclusion: FedCVD++ provides a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for multi-institutional healthcare settings, marking an important step toward robust federated learning systems for real-world applications.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) cause over 17 million deaths annually
worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for privacy-preserving predictive
systems. We introduce FedCVD++, an enhanced federated learning (FL) framework
that integrates both parametric models (logistic regression, SVM, neural
networks) and non-parametric models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for coronary heart
disease risk prediction. To address key FL challenges, we propose: (1)
tree-subset sampling that reduces Random Forest communication overhead by 70%,
(2) XGBoost-based feature extraction enabling lightweight federated ensembles,
and (3) federated SMOTE synchronization for resolving cross-institutional class
imbalance.
  Evaluated on the Framingham dataset (4,238 records), FedCVD++ achieves
state-of-the-art results: federated XGBoost (F1 = 0.80) surpasses its
centralized counterpart (F1 = 0.78), and federated Random Forest (F1 = 0.81)
matches non-federated performance. Additionally, our communication-efficient

### [200] [Planning for Cooler Cities: A Multimodal AI Framework for Predicting and Mitigating Urban Heat Stress through Urban Landscape Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23000)
*Shengao Yi,Xiaojiang Li,Wei Tu,Tianhong Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GSM-UTCI, a deep learning model for hyperlocal heat stress predictions at city-wide scalability, significantly reducing computational demand while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban planners need scalable tools to mitigate growing heat stress caused by both climate change and city expansion, as existing physical models can't efficiently process large urban areas.

Method: The proposed GSM-UTCI framework fuses land cover, morphology, and meteorological data using a FiLM architecture, trained on SOLWEIG maps to predict UTCI at fine resolution.

Result: GSM-UTCI delivers high accuracy (R²=0.9151, MAE=0.41°C) and rapid processing (under 5 minutes for a city), demonstrating measurable cooling effects of urban greening strategies, particularly tree canopy implementation.

Conclusion: GSM-UTCI offers a precise, scalable solution for urban heat stress assessment, supporting data-driven adaptation strategies and promoting sustainable urban design.

Abstract: As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization,
cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While
traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed
assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit
scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a
multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average
Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The
model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and
hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)
architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric
context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical
accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C,
while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire
city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate
systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare
earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially
heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree
conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average
change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further
reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover
proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable,
fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling
scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban
environments.

### [201] [Stop Evaluating AI with Human Tests, Develop Principled, AI-specific Tests instead](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23009)
*Tom Sühr,Florian E. Dorner,Olawale Salaudeen,Augustin Kelava,Samira Samadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques the practice of using human psychological tests for evaluating LLMs and advocates for AI-specific evaluation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The use of human-designed psychological and cognitive tests for evaluating LLMs risks misinterpreting their capabilities due to the lack of empirical validation and theoretical grounding.

Method: The paper conducts a theoretical critique and analysis of existing practices, emphasizing the need for principled, AI-specific tests.

Result: It identifies significant gaps in current evaluation measures and highlights issues such as validity concerns, data contamination, and cultural bias.

Conclusion: The authors propose developing tailored evaluation frameworks specifically for AI systems instead of repurposing human tests.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a range of
standardized tests originally designed to assess human cognitive and
psychological traits, such as intelligence and personality. While these results
are often interpreted as strong evidence of human-like characteristics in LLMs,
this paper argues that such interpretations constitute an ontological error.
Human psychological and educational tests are theory-driven measurement
instruments, calibrated to a specific human population. Applying these tests to
non-human subjects without empirical validation, risks mischaracterizing what
is being measured. Furthermore, a growing trend frames AI performance on
benchmarks as measurements of traits such as ``intelligence'', despite known
issues with validity, data contamination, cultural bias and sensitivity to
superficial prompt changes. We argue that interpreting benchmark performance as
measurements of human-like traits, lacks sufficient theoretical and empirical
justification. This leads to our position: Stop Evaluating AI with Human Tests,
Develop Principled, AI-specific Tests instead. We call for the development of
principled, AI-specific evaluation frameworks tailored to AI systems. Such
frameworks might build on existing frameworks for constructing and validating
psychometrics tests, or could be created entirely from scratch to fit the
unique context of AI.

### [202] [Directional Ensemble Aggregation for Actor-Critics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23501)
*Nicklas Werge,Yi-Shan Wu,Bahareh Tasdighi,Melih Kandemir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA), a dynamic method to better combine ensemble $Q$-value estimates for off-policy reinforcement learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static aggregation methods for $Q$-value estimates discard valuable information, fail to adapt to task-specific needs, and don't cater to different learning phases.

Method: DEA employs two learnable directional parameters using ensemble disagreement-weighted Bellman errors to adaptively adjust $Q$-value aggregation across critic conservatism and actor exploration.

Result: DEA adapts aggregation effectively to uncertainty and training phases, showcasing improved performance on continuous control benchmarks compared to static ensemble methods.

Conclusion: Directional learning via DEA provides adaptive and effective aggregation strategies, enhancing off-policy reinforcement learning across varied benchmarks and training regimes.

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning in continuous control tasks depends
critically on accurate $Q$-value estimates. Conservative aggregation over
ensembles, such as taking the minimum, is commonly used to mitigate
overestimation bias. However, these static rules are coarse, discard valuable
information from the ensemble, and cannot adapt to task-specific needs or
different learning regimes. We propose Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA),
an aggregation method that adaptively combines $Q$-value estimates in
actor-critic frameworks. DEA introduces two fully learnable directional
parameters: one that modulates critic-side conservatism and another that guides
actor-side policy exploration. Both parameters are learned using ensemble
disagreement-weighted Bellman errors, which weight each sample solely by the
direction of its Bellman error. This directional learning mechanism allows DEA
to adjust conservatism and exploration in a data-driven way, adapting
aggregation to both uncertainty levels and the phase of training. We evaluate
DEA across continuous control benchmarks and learning regimes - from
interactive to sample-efficient - and demonstrate its effectiveness over static
ensemble strategies.

### [203] [Investigating the Invertibility of Multimodal Latent Spaces: Limitations of Optimization-Based Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23010)
*Siwoo Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the challenges and limitations of multimodal latent spaces in performing inverse tasks, demonstrating their lack of semantic coherence in such applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task-specific AI models are outstanding at forward tasks like text-to-image generation or audio transcription, but their inverse capabilities—trying to infer specific inputs from outputs—remain unexplored.

Method: An optimization-based framework was applied to test inverse mappings across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio (Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.

Result: The experiments confirmed the hypothesis: while textual correctness can be achieved in inverse mappings, perceptual quality is chaotic, and the latent spaces often fail to produce semantically meaningful or interpretable reconstructions.

Conclusion: Multimodal latent spaces, designed for forward tasks, are inadequately structured for reliable inverse mappings, emphasizing a critical need for semantically richer and invertible latent space development.

Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of
multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence)
models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g.,
text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for
inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based
framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it
bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio
(Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.
  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models
towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently
support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings.
Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that
while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually
with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image
captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized
audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and
incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input
from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently
lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.
  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces,
primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the
structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work
underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically
rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SA-FDR is a simulated annealing-based algorithm for $
0$-norm feature selection, using Fisher discriminant ratio to optimize classification tasks and achieving compact, accurate feature selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve feature selection in high-dimensional classification tasks by addressing limitations of greedy optimization approaches and enhancing interpretability and sparsity of models.

Method: Simulated annealing as a global optimization strategy, guided by Fisher discriminant ratio, to select compact and accurate feature subsets.

Result: SA-FDR demonstrated superior performance in identifying minimal feature subsets while maintaining high predictive accuracy across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: SA-FDR effectively balances sparsity, interpretability, and performance in high-dimensional feature selection.

Abstract: We introduce SA-FDR, a novel algorithm for $\ell_0$-norm feature selection
that considers this task as a combinatorial optimisation problem and solves it
by using simulated annealing to perform a global search over the space of
feature subsets. The optimisation is guided by the Fisher discriminant ratio,
which we use as a computationally efficient proxy for model quality in
classification tasks. Our experiments, conducted on datasets with up to
hundreds of thousands of samples and hundreds of features, demonstrate that
SA-FDR consistently selects more compact feature subsets while achieving a high
predictive accuracy. This ability to recover informative yet minimal sets of
features stems from its capacity to capture inter-feature dependencies often
missed by greedy optimisation approaches. As a result, SA-FDR provides a
flexible and effective solution for designing interpretable models in
high-dimensional settings, particularly when model sparsity, interpretability,
and performance are crucial.

*Aurélie Leribaux,Rafael Oyamada,Johannes De Smedt,Zahra Dasht Bozorgi,Artem Polyvyanyy,Jochen De Weerdt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper integrates actor behavior analysis with Granger causality to analyze temporal dependencies in processes and their outcomes, using time series data from real-world event logs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of traditional process mining approaches that overlook temporal and causal dynamics in individual actor behavior, which significantly influences real-world process outcomes.

Method: The authors use Granger causality combined with actor interaction data (such as continuation, interruption, and handovers) and apply Group Lasso for lag selection to identify influential causal links in time series data.

Result: The approach identifies a small set of influential lags that explain the majority of causal effects, demonstrating that specific actor behaviors directly and measurably affect process performance, particularly throughput time.

Conclusion: The work highlights the utility of actor-centric, time series-based methods for gaining deeper insights into temporal dependencies and actor behavior impacts on process efficiency.

Abstract: Understanding how actor behavior influences process outcomes is a critical
aspect of process mining. Traditional approaches often use aggregate and static
process data, overlooking the temporal and causal dynamics that arise from
individual actor behavior. This limits the ability to accurately capture the
complexity of real-world processes, where individual actor behavior and
interactions between actors significantly shape performance. In this work, we
address this gap by integrating actor behavior analysis with Granger causality
to identify correlating links in time series data. We apply this approach to
realworld event logs, constructing time series for actor interactions, i.e.
continuation, interruption, and handovers, and process outcomes. Using Group
Lasso for lag selection, we identify a small but consistently influential set
of lags that capture the majority of causal influence, revealing that actor
behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly
throughput time. These findings demonstrate the potential of actor-centric,
time series-based methods for uncovering the temporal dependencies that drive
process outcomes, offering a more nuanced understanding of how individual
behaviors impact overall process efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning model using ICU data predicts vancomycin-related kidney injury with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vancomycin's nephrotoxicity risk makes early prediction of kidney injury crucial for ICU patients.

Method: The study used ICU patient data from the MIMIC-IV database, feature selection techniques, and tested six machine learning algorithms, with CatBoost performing best.

Result: The model achieved high performance (AUROC 0.818, sensitivity 0.800, specificity 0.681) and identified key predictors like phosphate and magnesium.

Conclusion: The model facilitates early detection of vancomycin-associated kidney injury, enabling timely ICU interventions.

Abstract: Background: Vancomycin, a key antibiotic for severe Gram-positive infections
in ICUs, poses a high nephrotoxicity risk. Early prediction of kidney injury in
critically ill patients is challenging. This study aimed to develop a machine
learning model to predict vancomycin-related creatinine elevation using routine
ICU data.
  Methods: We analyzed 10,288 ICU patients (aged 18-80) from the MIMIC-IV
database who received vancomycin. Kidney injury was defined by KDIGO criteria
(creatinine rise >=0.3 mg/dL within 48h or >=50% within 7d). Features were
selected via SelectKBest (top 30) and Random Forest ranking (final 15). Six
algorithms were tested with 5-fold cross-validation. Interpretability was
evaluated using SHAP, Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), and Bayesian posterior
sampling.
  Results: Of 10,288 patients, 2,903 (28.2%) developed creatinine elevation.
CatBoost performed best (AUROC 0.818 [95% CI: 0.801-0.834], sensitivity 0.800,
specificity 0.681, negative predictive value 0.900). Key predictors were
phosphate, total bilirubin, magnesium, Charlson index, and APSIII. SHAP
confirmed phosphate as a major risk factor. ALE showed dose-response patterns.
Bayesian analysis estimated mean risk 60.5% (95% credible interval: 16.8-89.4%)
in high-risk cases.
  Conclusions: This machine learning model predicts vancomycin-associated
creatinine elevation from routine ICU data with strong accuracy and
interpretability, enabling early risk detection and supporting timely
interventions in critical care.

TL;DR: Investigates ensuring local differential privacy in thresholding bandit problems, proposes private algorithms, and analyzes theoretical and lower bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in bandit problems while maintaining effective decision-making.

Method: Introduced Bernoulli-based mechanisms for private responses, analyzed and derived performance bounds for algorithms.

Result: Strong privacy guarantees achieved, upper and lower bounds derived, algorithms efficient with minimal additional loss.

Conclusion: The study offers insights into privacy-preserving methods for bandit problems, matching theoretical efficiency bounds with privacy considerations.

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of ensuring local differential privacy in
the thresholding bandit problem. We consider both the fixed budget and fixed
confidence settings. We propose methods that utilize private responses,
obtained through a Bernoulli-based differentially private mechanism, to
identify arms with expected rewards exceeding a predefined threshold. We show
that this procedure provides strong privacy guarantees and derive theoretical
performance bounds on the proposed algorithms. Additionally, we present general
lower bounds that characterize the additional loss incurred by any
differentially private mechanism, and show that the presented algorithms match
these lower bounds up to poly-logarithmic factors. Our results provide valuable
insights into privacy-preserving decision-making frameworks in bandit problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a transformer-based foundation model for fracture prediction, combining multimodal input from various materials and simulations for greater generalizability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for predicting material fracture either lack robustness and generalization (machine learning) or are resource-intensive and fragmented (physics-based simulators).

Method: A transformer-based foundation model is developed, using multimodal inputs (structured/unstructured meshes and material properties text embeddings) to generalize fracture prediction across materials and simulation scenarios.

Result: The model generalizes to unseen materials with minimal data, excels in multiple fracture-related tasks, and reduces data dependence compared to standard machine learning.

Conclusion: Fracture prediction can effectively be unified under a single scalable and extensible model architecture, streamlining workflows that are currently simulator-specific.

Abstract: Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing
safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that
operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across
the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world
applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are
trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize.
Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are
fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance
computing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations,
we present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a
transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of
materials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and
tungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured
and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of
textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and
solver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation
across simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture. The
trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks,
including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting
to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to
unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single
sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML. Our results
show that fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture,
offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates performance and energy usage of AI-enabled edge devices, identifying trade-offs for informed decisions on model-device pairing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the popularity of deploying AI models on edge devices for latency-critical IoT applications, there is a lack of research on their performance and energy usage.

Method: The authors analyze the performance of neural networks and large language models by measuring inference time, power usage, memory consumption, and F1 scores across multiple edge devices.

Result: The study characterizes trade-offs and showcases how hardware/framework optimizations and external tunings impact the balance between performance and resource needs.

Conclusion: Understanding these trade-offs will help in optimizing edge AI deployments for practical use cases respecting constraints like power and latency.

Abstract: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its cutting-edge
AI-enabled applications (e.g., autonomous vehicles and smart industries)
combine two paradigms: data-driven systems and their deployment on the edge.
Usually, edge devices perform inferences to support latency-critical
applications. In addition to the performance of these resource-constrained edge
devices, their energy usage is a critical factor in adopting and deploying edge
applications. Examples of such devices include Raspberry Pi (RPi), Intel Neural
Compute Stick (INCS), NVIDIA Jetson nano (NJn), and Google Coral USB (GCU).
Despite their adoption in edge deployment for AI inferences, there is no study
on their performance and energy usage for informed decision-making on the
device and model selection to meet the demands of applications. This study
fills the gap by rigorously characterizing the performance of traditional,
neural networks, and large language models on the above-edge devices.
Specifically, we analyze trade-offs among model F1 score, inference time,
inference power, and memory usage. Hardware and framework optimization, along
with external parameter tuning of AI models, can balance between model
performance and resource usage to realize practical edge AI deployments.

*Richard Williams,Eric Nalisnick,Andrew Holbrook*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BiGG-E, an autoregressive model for generating weighted graphs that efficiently learns the joint distribution of graph topology and edge weights, achieving scalable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing generative models for weighted graphs is crucial due to their widespread application in fields like biology, chemistry, and social sciences.

Method: BiGG-E builds upon the BiGG model, extending it to jointly model graph topology and edge weights, leveraging sparsity for efficient graph generation.

Result: BiGG-E outperforms existing methods in capturing distributions over weighted graphs, validated by simulations and benchmark experiments.

Conclusion: BiGG-E improves the generation of weighted graphs and offers scalability and efficiency in this domain.

Abstract: Weighted graphs are ubiquitous throughout biology, chemistry, and the social
sciences, motivating the development of generative models for abstract weighted
graph data using deep neural networks. However, most current deep generative
models are either designed for unweighted graphs and are not easily extended to
weighted topologies or incorporate edge weights without consideration of a
joint distribution with topology. Furthermore, learning a distribution over
weighted graphs must account for complex nonlocal dependencies between both the
edges of the graph and corresponding weights of each edge. We develop an
autoregressive model BiGG-E, a nontrivial extension of the BiGG model, that
learns a joint distribution over weighted graphs while still exploiting
sparsity to generate a weighted graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges in $O((n +
m)\log n)$ time. Simulation studies and experiments on a variety of benchmark
datasets demonstrate that BiGG-E best captures distributions over weighted
graphs while remaining scalable and computationally efficient.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CostCert, a method for certified recovery in patch robustness certification against adversarial patch attacks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like PatchGuard significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to adversarial patch attacks fail to precisely certify the true label in top-k predictions due to attack budget limitations or suffer from computational complexity.

Method: The paper presents CostCert, a scalable method that avoids pairwise comparisons and combinatorial explosion by focusing on attack budget infeasibility to remove true labels from the top-k predictions.

Result: CostCert significantly surpasses current methods like PatchGuard, achieving up to 57.3% certified accuracy for large patch sizes where PatchGuard's accuracy falls to zero.

Conclusion: CostCert offers a more precise and scalable solution for certified recovery in defending against adversarial patch attacks, improving robustness and accuracy.

Abstract: Patch robustness certification is an emerging verification approach for
defending against adversarial patch attacks with provable guarantees for deep
learning systems. Certified recovery techniques guarantee the prediction of the
sole true label of a certified sample. However, existing techniques, if
applicable to top-k predictions, commonly conduct pairwise comparisons on those
votes between labels, failing to certify the sole true label within the top k
prediction labels precisely due to the inflation on the number of votes
controlled by the attacker (i.e., attack budget); yet enumerating all
combinations of vote allocation suffers from the combinatorial explosion
problem. We propose CostCert, a novel, scalable, and precise voting-based
certified recovery defender. CostCert verifies the true label of a sample
within the top k predictions without pairwise comparisons and combinatorial
explosion through a novel design: whether the attack budget on the sample is
infeasible to cover the smallest total additional votes on top of the votes
uncontrollable by the attacker to exclude the true labels from the top k
prediction labels. Experiments show that CostCert significantly outperforms the
current state-of-the-art defender PatchGuard, such as retaining up to 57.3% in
certified accuracy when the patch size is 96, whereas PatchGuard has already
dropped to zero.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern data privacy agreements allow users to opt out of sharing data, creating challenges in federated learning systems due to missing data and straggler devices.

Method: FLOSS is proposed as a system that compensates for the degradation in model performance caused by missing data from stragglers and user opt-outs, evaluated through simulations.

Result: Simulations demonstrate FLOSS's effectiveness in managing missing data and reducing associated bias in federated learning environments.

Conclusion: FLOSS offers a practical solution to preserve model performance and mitigate data bias in federated learning systems affected by privacy opt-outs and straggling devices.

Abstract: Previous work on data privacy in federated learning systems focuses on
privacy-preserving operations for data from users who have agreed to share
their data for training. However, modern data privacy agreements also empower
users to use the system while opting out of sharing their data as desired. When
combined with stragglers that arise from heterogeneous device capabilities, the
result is missing data from a variety of sources that introduces bias and
degrades model performance. In this paper, we present FLOSS, a system that
mitigates the impacts of such missing data on federated learning in the
presence of stragglers and user opt-out, and empirically demonstrate its
performance in simulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While strong ID-OOD performance correlations have been shown in computer vision, such correlations are not well-explored in audio-based models. The motivation is to understand how different training methods impact robustness and generalization in speech classifiers.

Method: The paper benchmarks multiple neural architectures of spoken keyword classifiers on various evaluation sets. Two metrics, Fairness and Robustness, are used to evaluate the impact of training strategies and noise conditions.

Result: Noise-aware training demonstrated some improvements in robustness, highlighting its potential benefits and limitations for speech model generalization.

Conclusion: The study provides valuable insights into the role of noise-based augmentations for enhancing the robustness and generalization of audio-based models. It emphasizes the potential and boundaries of using such techniques.

Abstract: Although prior work in computer vision has shown strong correlations between
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracies, such
relationships remain underexplored in audio-based models. In this study, we
investigate how training conditions and input features affect the robustness
and generalization abilities of spoken keyword classifiers under OOD
conditions. We benchmark several neural architectures across a variety of
evaluation sets. To quantify the impact of noise on generalization, we make use
of two metrics: Fairness (F), which measures overall accuracy gains compared to
a baseline model, and Robustness (R), which assesses the convergence between ID
and OOD performance. Our results suggest that noise-aware training improves
robustness in some configurations. These findings shed new light on the
benefits and limitations of noise-based augmentation for generalization in
speech models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the issue of arbitrariness in probabilistic classification due to observational multiplicity. It introduces a regret-based measure to evaluate prediction uncertainties and demonstrates its use in promoting safety through abstention and data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of arbitrariness in model predictions, which can harm interpretability and safety when different models provide conflicting probability predictions in classification tasks.

Method: The authors propose a regret-based measure to evaluate arbitrariness in probabilistic classification, and they provide a general-purpose method to estimate regret. They further analyze how regret is distributed among different groups in a dataset.

Result: The authors discover that regret is higher for specific groups within the dataset and show how regret estimation can aid in safety measures such as abstention and better data collection.

Conclusion: By introducing regret as a tool for measuring arbitrariness in classification tasks, the authors present a framework that promotes safer and more interpretable applications in real-world settings.

Abstract: Many prediction tasks can admit multiple models that can perform almost
equally well. This phenomenon can can undermine interpretability and safety
when competing models assign conflicting predictions to individuals. In this
work, we study how arbitrariness can arise in probabilistic classification
tasks as a result of an effect that we call \emph{observational multiplicity}.
We discuss how this effect arises in a broad class of practical applications
where we learn a classifier to predict probabilities $p_i \in [0,1]$ but are
given a dataset of observations $y_i \in \{0,1\}$. We propose to evaluate the
arbitrariness of individual probability predictions through the lens of
\emph{regret}. We introduce a measure of regret for probabilistic
classification tasks, which measures how the predictions of a model could
change as a result of different training labels change. We present a
general-purpose method to estimate the regret in a probabilistic classification
task. We use our measure to show that regret is higher for certain groups in
the dataset and discuss potential applications of regret. We demonstrate how
estimating regret promote safety in real-world applications by abstention and
data collection.

*Xiangshu Gong,Zhiqiang Xie,Xiaowei Jin,Chen Wang,Yanling Qu,Wangmeng Zuo,Hui Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel AI paradigm for solving differential equations (DEs) efficiently and accurately, overcoming limitations of data scarcity and approximation of high-frequency components (AHFC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing AI solvers struggle with handling scarce data and accurately approximating high-frequency components in differential equations, necessitating a new approach.

Method: The approach involves a DE-ruled first-principles data generation methodology to produce extensive datasets. A scale-dilation operator (SDO) is introduced alongside an attention-based Transformer AI solver to handle high-frequency components.

Result: The proposed AI methodology achieves superior accuracy in solving diverse differential equations compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The research provides a practical AI-driven solution for differential equations, with broad implications for nature and engineering fields.

Abstract: Many problems are governed by differential equations (DEs). Artificial
intelligence (AI) is a new path for solving DEs. However, data is very scarce
and existing AI solvers struggle with approximation of high frequency
components (AHFC). We propose an AI paradigm for solving diverse DEs, including
DE-ruled first-principles data generation methodology and scale-dilation
operator (SDO) AI solver. Using either prior knowledge or random fields, we
generate solutions and then substitute them into the DEs to derive the sources
and initial/boundary conditions through balancing DEs, thus producing
arbitrarily vast amount of, first-principles-consistent training datasets at
extremely low computational cost. We introduce a reversible SDO that leverages
the Fourier transform of the multiscale solutions to fix AHFC, and design a
spatiotemporally coupled, attention-based Transformer AI solver of DEs with
SDO. An upper bound on the Hessian condition number of the loss function is
proven to be proportional to the squared 2-norm of the solution gradient,
revealing that SDO yields a smoother loss landscape, consequently fixing AHFC
with efficient training. Extensive tests on diverse DEs demonstrate that our AI
paradigm achieves consistently superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.
This work makes AI solver of DEs to be truly usable in broad nature and
engineering fields.

### [216] [FuseTen: A Generative Model for Daily 10 m Land Surface Temperature Estimation from Spatio-Temporal Satellite Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23154)
*Sofiane Bouaziz,Adel Hafiane,Raphael Canals,Rachid Nedjai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The research introduces FuseTen, a generative framework that enhances land surface temperature (LST) analysis by combining satellite data for improved daily observations at a fine 10m resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate challenges like urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation necessitate more precise spatio-temporal land surface temperature data from satellite platforms.

Method: FuseTen uses spatio-temporal fusion of Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, Terra MODIS data, incorporating generative architecture, attention and normalization modules, PatchGAN discriminator, and physical averaging-based supervision.

Result: FuseTen surpasses linear methods by delivering 32.06% better quantitative metrics and 31.42% enhanced visual fidelity in daily LST observations.

Conclusion: FuseTen represents a significant leap as the first nonlinear method delivering daily LST estimates at 10m spatial resolution, aiding climate phenomena analysis.

Abstract: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation are pressing and growing
challenges in the context of climate change. A valuable approach to studying
them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions.
One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these
phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites
and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's
surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a
novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m
spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from
Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative
architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in
physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within
the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism.
Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear
baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and
31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial
resolution.

*Jinan Zhou,Rajat Ghosh,Vaishnavi Bhargava,Debojyoti Dutta,Aryan Singhal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper establishes that LLM services face a trade-off among inference-time efficiency, factual accuracy, and reasoning capabilities, and introduces a framework called The BAR Theorem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners aim to design LLM services that excel in inference efficiency, factual authenticity, and reasoning power, yet struggle to align all three.

Method: The authors conduct an analytical study to formally prove the trade-off between the three properties and create The BAR Theorem framework for application design.

Result: They demonstrate the existence of the trade-off and propose The BAR Theorem, a rigorous framework aiding design decisions for LLM applications.

Conclusion: No single model can optimize inference-time budget, factual authenticity, and reasoning capacity simultaneously. The BAR Theorem provides guidance for managing these trade-offs.

Abstract: When designing LLM services, practitioners care about three key properties:
inference-time budget, factual authenticity, and reasoning capacity. However,
our analysis shows that no model can simultaneously optimize for all three. We
formally prove this trade-off and propose a principled framework named The BAR
Theorem for LLM-application design.

*Hyeon Seong Jeong,Sangwoo Jo,Byeong Hyun Yoon,Yoonseok Heo,Haedong Jeong,Taehoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DocsRay, a training-free document understanding system that integrates pseudo Table of Contents generation and hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented Generation for multimodal documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of processing complex multimodal documents, which often have structural inconsistencies and limited training data.

Method: The method combines three techniques: generating a pseudo-Table of Contents using prompt-based LLMs, zero-shot multimodal analysis converting document elements into text-centric formats, and a hierarchical retrieval system to improve efficiency.

Result: DocsRay improves query latency by 45% (from 3.89 to 2.12 seconds) and achieves an accuracy of 64.7% on the MMLongBench-Doc benchmark, surpassing prior best results.

Conclusion: DocsRay demonstrates the potential of a training-free, LLM-based approach for efficient and accurate multimodal document understanding.

Abstract: Understanding complex multimodal documents remains challenging due to their
structural inconsistencies and limited training data availability. We introduce
\textit{DocsRay}, a training-free document understanding system that integrates
pseudo Table of Contents (TOC) generation with hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). Our approach leverages multimodal Large Language Models'
(LLMs) native capabilities to seamlessly process documents containing diverse
elements such as text, images, charts, and tables without requiring specialized
models or additional training. DocsRay's framework synergistically combines
three key techniques: (1) a semantic structuring module using prompt-based LLM
interactions to generate a hierarchical pseudo-TOC, (2) zero-shot multimodal
analysis that converts diverse document elements into unified, text-centric
representations using the inherent capabilities of multimodal LLMs, and (3) an
efficient two-stage hierarchical retrieval system that reduces retrieval
complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(S + k_1 \cdot N_s)$. Evaluated on documents
averaging 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens, DocsRay reduced query latency
from 3.89 to 2.12 seconds, achieving a 45% efficiency improvement. On the
MMLongBench-Doc benchmark, DocsRay-Pro attains an accuracy of 64.7%,
substantially surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.

*Charles O'Neill,Slava Chalnev,Chi Chi Zhao,Max Kirkby,Mudith Jayasekara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generator-agnostic observer model to detect AI hallucinations, achieving superior accuracy and suggesting actionable mechanisms for steering hallucination rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems frequently generate contextual hallucinations, posing challenges for accuracy and reliability in text generation.

Method: Using a forward pass and a linear probe on the residual stream, the observer model isolates a transferable direction between hallucinated and faithful text, exploiting sparse MLP activity for actionable insights.

Result: The model outperformed baselines by 5-27 points and demonstrated consistent detection across mid-layers in large-scale models (2B to 27B). Gradient analysis localized the hallucination signal to specific MLP sub-circuits.

Conclusion: The study highlights a low-dimensional internal structure responsible for hallucination tracking and control, offering practical solutions for detection and mitigation in AI systems, supplemented by the release of the ContraTales benchmark.

Abstract: Contextual hallucinations -- statements unsupported by given context --
remain a significant challenge in AI. We demonstrate a practical
interpretability insight: a generator-agnostic observer model detects
hallucinations via a single forward pass and a linear probe on its residual
stream. This probe isolates a single, transferable linear direction separating
hallucinated from faithful text, outperforming baselines by 5-27 points and
showing robust mid-layer performance across Gemma-2 models (2B to 27B).
Gradient-times-activation localises this signal to sparse, late-layer MLP
activity. Critically, manipulating this direction causally steers generator
hallucination rates, proving its actionability. Our results offer novel
evidence of internal, low-dimensional hallucination tracking linked to specific
MLP sub-circuits, exploitable for detection and mitigation. We release the
2000-example ContraTales benchmark for realistic assessment of such solutions.

### [220] [Efficient Machine Unlearning via Influence Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23257)
*Jiawei Liu,Chenwang Wu,Defu Lian,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine unlearning methods traditionally rely on influence-based approaches to forget training data, which are computationally expensive. This paper proposes the Influence Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm, leveraging insights from incremental learning to efficiently achieve unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the growing need to address privacy concerns through machine unlearning, especially for large-scale models and frequent data deletion, while circumventing the computational burdens of current methods.

Method: The authors draw on cognitive science insights to establish a theoretical link between incremental learning (memorizing) and machine unlearning (forgetting) and propose the IAU algorithm, based on efficient gradient optimization rather than Hessian computations.

Result: Extensive experiments show that the IAU algorithm balances removal guarantees, unlearning efficiency, and model utility, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: IAU provides an effective and computationally efficient approach to machine unlearning, with theoretical grounding and empirical validation, advancing the practicality of privacy-focused learning systems.

Abstract: Due to growing privacy concerns, machine unlearning, which aims at enabling
machine learning models to ``forget" specific training data, has received
increasing attention. Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has
emerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of
individual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However,
this approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the
necessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training
samples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and
scenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the
difficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that
memorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link
between memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This
connection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of
incremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in
unlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on
more efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned
cognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence
Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from
the incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
IAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency,
and comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods
across diverse datasets and model architectures. Our code is available at

*Hui Yi Leong,Yuqing Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynaSwarm is a new MAS framework that dynamically adapts graph structures using reinforcement learning and parameter-efficient LLM tuning, outperforming current baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MAS frameworks use static, manually designed collaboration graphs, limiting adaptability and performance.

Method: Introduced a reinforcement learning method (A2C) for graph optimization and a dynamic graph selector for sample-specific LLM fine-tuning.

Result: DynaSwarm showed better performance than state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS baselines in tasks like QA, math reasoning, and coding.

Conclusion: Dynamic, sample-specific graph structures improve efficiency and effectiveness in LLM-based MAS frameworks.

Abstract: Current multi-agent systems (MAS) frameworks often rely on manually designed
and static collaboration graph structures, limiting adaptability and
performance. To address these limitations, we propose DynaSwarm, a dynamic
framework that enhances LLM-based MAS through two key innovations: (1) an
actor-critic reinforcement learning (A2C) mechanism to optimize graph
structures with improved stability over prior RL methods, and (2) a dynamic
graph selector that adaptively chooses the optimal graph structure for each
input sample via parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning. DynaSwarm eliminates the
need for rigid, one-fits-all graph architectures, instead leveraging
sample-specific idiosyncrasies to dynamically route queries through specialized
agent networks. (c) We propose to fine-tune the demonstration retriever to
fully exploit the power of in-context learning (ICL). Extensive experiments on
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding tasks demonstrate that
DynaSwarm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS
baselines across multiple LLM backbones. Our findings highlight the importance
of sample-aware structural flexibility in LLM MAS designs.

*Yuetian Chen,Zhiqi Wang,Nathalie Baracaldo,Swanand Ravindra Kadhe,Lei Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to analyze how and when individual samples in a training dataset face privacy risks, particularly under membership inference attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of understanding about when and how privacy risks, such as membership inference vulnerabilities, manifest during the training of deep learning models.

Method: The authors track sample-level vulnerabilities on an FPR-TPR plane throughout the training process, examining how factors like dataset complexity, model architecture, and optimizer choice affect privacy risks.

Result: The study finds that the privacy risk of highly vulnerable samples is correlated with their intrinsic learning difficulty and is largely determined early in the training process.

Conclusion: The findings enable a better understanding of privacy risk development during training and provide insights for developing privacy-aware, proactive training strategies.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a critical threat to the privacy of
training data in deep learning. Despite significant progress in attack
methodologies, our understanding of when and how models encode membership
information during training remains limited. This paper presents a dynamic
analytical framework for dissecting and quantifying privacy leakage dynamics at
the individual sample level. By tracking per-sample vulnerabilities on an
FPR-TPR plane throughout training, our framework systematically measures how
factors such as dataset complexity, model architecture, and optimizer choice
influence the rate and severity at which samples become vulnerable. Crucially,
we discover a robust correlation between a sample's intrinsic learning
difficulty, and find that the privacy risk of samples highly vulnerable in the
final trained model is largely determined early during training. Our results
thus provide a deeper understanding of how privacy risks dynamically emerge
during training, laying the groundwork for proactive, privacy-aware model
training strategies.

*Luca Corbucci,Javier Alejandro Borges Legrottaglie,Francesco Spinnato,Anna Monreale,Riccardo Guidotti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the forgotten item prediction task in Next Basket Prediction (NBP), addressing unintentionally omitted items with interpretable algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to fill a gap in the NBP domain by addressing the challenge of identifying and predicting unintentionally forgotten items during supermarket visits, a task hindered by scarce datasets and prevailing black-box models.

Method: Two novel, interpretable-by-design algorithms were developed for detecting forgotten items and providing human-understandable explanations for their predictions.

Result: The proposed algorithms achieved superiority over state-of-the-art NBP baselines, improving by 10-15% on multiple evaluation metrics when tested on a real-world retail dataset.

Conclusion: The study successfully advances the NBP field by introducing forgotten item predictions paired with algorithms that are both effective and interpretable for end users.

Abstract: Accurately identifying items forgotten during a supermarket visit and
providing clear, interpretable explanations for recommending them remains an
underexplored problem within the Next Basket Prediction (NBP) domain. Existing
NBP approaches typically only focus on forecasting future purchases, without
explicitly addressing the detection of unintentionally omitted items. This gap
is partly due to the scarcity of real-world datasets that allow for the
reliable estimation of forgotten items. Furthermore, most current NBP methods
rely on black-box models, which lack transparency and limit the ability to
justify recommendations to end users. In this paper, we formally introduce the
forgotten item prediction task and propose two novel interpretable-by-design
algorithms. These methods are tailored to identify forgotten items while
offering intuitive, human-understandable explanations. Experiments on a
real-world retail dataset show our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art NBP
baselines by 10-15% across multiple evaluation metrics.

*Tao He,Rongchuan Mu,Lizi Liao,Yixin Cao,Ming Liu,Bing Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an innovative reward mechanism to enhance RL training for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). It integrates structured process rewards and a new off-policy RL algorithm, TP-GRPO, to improve math problem-solving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RL optimization for LRMs depends on sparse outcome-only rewards, making the training process inefficient. The paper is motivated to create more effective feedback mechanisms for optimizing LRMs.

Method: The paper proposes Process Reward Models (PRMs) to evaluate generative processes at the thought level using intrinsic signals. It introduces structured rewards for coherent units and a capability-adaptive mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation. These innovations are implemented in TP-GRPO.

Result: Experiments with 1.5B and 7B parameter LRMs demonstrate improved problem-solving accuracy requiring fewer training samples compared to outcome-only reward baselines.

Conclusion: Structured process rewards and the TP-GRPO algorithm enhance LRM optimization, demonstrating significant improvement in math reasoning tasks while requiring fewer samples. These findings suggest a more efficient approach to training large-scale reasoning models.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently shown promise in solving complex
math problems when optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). But conventional
approaches rely on outcome-only rewards that provide sparse feedback, resulting
in inefficient optimization process. In this work, we investigate the function
of process reward models (PRMs) to accelerate the RL training for LRMs. We
propose a novel intrinsic signal-driven generative process evaluation mechanism
operating at the thought level to address major bottlenecks in RL-based
training. Specifically, instead of requiring PRMs to know how to solve
problems, our method uses intrinsic signals in solutions to judge stepwise
correctness and aggregate contiguous correct/incorrect steps into coherent
'thought' units. This structured, thought-level rewards enable more reliable
credit assignment by reducing ambiguity in step segmentation and alleviating
reward hacking. We further introduce a capability-adaptive reward mechanism
that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on the LRM's
current proficiency, guiding learning without stifling creative
trial-and-error. These innovations are integrated into a new off-policy RL
algorithm, TP-GRPO, which extends grouped proximal optimization with
process-based rewards and improves training efficiency. Experiments on 1.5B and
7B parameter LRMs demonstrate that our method achieves higher problem-solving
accuracy with significantly fewer training samples than outcome-only reward
baselines. The results validate that well-structured process rewards can
substantially accelerate LRM optimization in math reasoning tasks. Code is

*Tung M. Luu,Donghoon Lee,Younghwan Lee,Chang D. Yoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents PLARE, a method leveraging vision-language models to provide preference labels for training offline RL agents, eliminating the need for manual reward function design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of offline reinforcement learning where reward labeling is costly and requires significant expertise.

Method: The method uses vision-language models to generate preference labels for visual trajectory segments based on task descriptions, avoiding manual reward functions and using a supervised contrastive learning objective for training.

Result: PLARE demonstrates state-of-the-art or superior performance in robotic manipulation tasks compared to existing VLM-based methods, validated both in simulations and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: PLARE is an effective and practical approach for training robotic agents in offline RL settings, bypassing the challenges of manual reward design and demonstrating applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a powerful framework for
training robotic agents using pre-collected, suboptimal datasets, eliminating
the need for costly, time-consuming, and potentially hazardous online
interactions. This is particularly useful in safety-critical real-world
applications, where online data collection is expensive and impractical.
However, existing offline RL algorithms typically require reward labeled data,
which introduces an additional bottleneck: reward function design is itself
costly, labor-intensive, and requires significant domain expertise. In this
paper, we introduce PLARE, a novel approach that leverages large
vision-language models (VLMs) to provide guidance signals for agent training.
Instead of relying on manually designed reward functions, PLARE queries a VLM
for preference labels on pairs of visual trajectory segments based on a
language task description. The policy is then trained directly from these
preference labels using a supervised contrastive preference learning objective,
bypassing the need to learn explicit reward models. Through extensive
experiments on robotic manipulation tasks from the MetaWorld, PLARE achieves
performance on par with or surpassing existing state-of-the-art VLM-based
reward generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
PLARE in real-world manipulation tasks with a physical robot, further
validating its practical applicability.

*Tatsuya Mitomi,Fumiyasu Makinoshima,Fumiya Makihara,Eigo Segawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a dynamic pricing system for bike-sharing services to balance inventory without manual relocation. Simulations show high accuracy, speed, and cost efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve inventory imbalance in bike-sharing systems caused by spatiotemporally varying user demands, which lead to additional relocation costs.

Method: The authors developed a differentiable agent-based simulation to design optimal dynamic pricing policies, factoring in diverse user backgrounds and probabilistic choices.

Result: The method achieved a 73%-78% reduction in loss, over 100-fold increase in convergence speed in experiments with 25 stations and scaled effectively to a scenario with 289 stations and 1156 parameters.

Conclusion: Dynamic pricing can naturally induce balanced inventory and minimize discount costs through proper initial conditions, eliminating the need for manual bicycle relocation.

Abstract: Bike-sharing systems are emerging in various cities as a new ecofriendly
transportation system. In these systems, spatiotemporally varying user demands
lead to imbalanced inventory at bicycle stations, resulting in additional
relocation costs. Therefore, it is essential to manage user demand through
optimal dynamic pricing for the system. However, optimal pricing design for
such a system is challenging because the system involves users with diverse
backgrounds and their probabilistic choices. To address this problem, we
develop a differentiable agent-based simulation to rapidly design dynamic
pricing in bike-sharing systems, achieving balanced bicycle inventory despite
spatiotemporally heterogeneous trips and probabilistic user decisions. We first
validate our approach against conventional methods through numerical
experiments involving 25 bicycle stations and five time slots, yielding 100
parameters. Compared to the conventional methods, our approach obtains a more
accurate solution with a 73% to 78% reduction in loss while achieving more than
a 100-fold increase in convergence speed. We further validate our approach on a
large-scale urban bike-sharing system scenario involving 289 bicycle stations,
resulting in a total of 1156 parameters. Through simulations using the obtained
pricing policies, we confirm that these policies can naturally induce balanced
inventory without any manual relocation. Additionally, we find that the cost of
discounts to induce the balanced inventory can be minimized by setting
appropriate initial conditions.

TL;DR: The paper explores extending model-based concept drift explanations in machine learning to causal explanations to improve actionable interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the impact of changes, such as concept drift, on systems like manufacturing and critical infrastructure is crucial to prevent and address model failures, errors, and malfunctions.

Method: The work introduces an extended framework for drift explanations by incorporating causality to isolate features impacted by concept drift, enabling tailored interventions.

Result: The proposed strategy is evaluated across various use cases, proving its effectiveness in identifying causally relevant features affected by concept drift.

Conclusion: The framework enhances the actionability of concept drift explanations, aiding targeted interventions to address issues in complex systems.

Abstract: In a world that constantly changes, it is crucial to understand how those
changes impact different systems, such as industrial manufacturing or critical
infrastructure. Explaining critical changes, referred to as concept drift in
the field of machine learning, is the first step towards enabling targeted
interventions to avoid or correct model failures, as well as malfunctions and
errors in the physical world. Therefore, in this work, we extend model-based
drift explanations towards causal explanations, which increases the
actionability of the provided explanations. We evaluate our explanation
strategy on a number of use cases, demonstrating the practical usefulness of
our framework, which isolates the causally relevant features impacted by
concept drift and, thus, allows for targeted intervention.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting honey adulteration, which is crucial for consumer protection and maintaining honey quality standards.

Method: The research uses mineral element profiles for honey adulteration detection. It preprocesses data (handling missing values and normalization) and employs three ML classification models: logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest.

Result: Random forest demonstrated the highest accuracy among the classifiers in honey adulteration detection, with a cross-validation accuracy of 98.37%.

Conclusion: Honey mineral element profile is a valuable feature for adulteration detection, and random forest is an effective model for achieving high accuracy in this task.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a Machine Learning (ML)-based system for detecting

authentic and adulterated honey. To evaluate the performance of the ML models,
we use a public dataset comprising measurements of mineral element content of
authentic honey, sugar syrups, and adul-terated honey. Experimental findings

Proved a universality theorem to unify this approach theoretically. Evaluated performance using benchmark PDEs like Burgers', Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, and Navier-Stokes equations.

Result: The proposed ST-SSM outperformed comparative schemes and benchmarks in terms of parameter efficiency and accuracy while demonstrating competitive performance under diverse physical conditions.

Conclusion: Dimensionally factorized operator learning is a promising approach for efficient and generalizable PDE modeling, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical validation.

Abstract: We propose the Spatiotemporal State Space Neural Operator (ST-SSM), a compact
architecture for learning solution operators of time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs). ST-SSM introduces a novel factorization of the
spatial and temporal dimensions, using structured state-space models to
independently model temporal evolution and spatial interactions. This design
enables parameter efficiency and flexible modeling of long-range spatiotemporal
dynamics. A theoretical connection is established between SSMs and neural
operators, and a unified universality theorem is proved for the resulting class
of architectures. Empirically, we demonstrate that our factorized formulation
outperforms alternative schemes such as zigzag scanning and parallel
independent processing on several PDE benchmarks, including 1D Burgers'
equation, 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and 2D Navier-Stokes equations
under varying physical conditions. Our model performs competitively with
existing baselines while using significantly fewer parameters. In addition, our
results reinforce previous findings on the benefits of temporal memory by
showing improved performance under partial observability. Our results highlight
the advantages of dimensionally factorized operator learning for efficient and
generalizable PDE modeling, and put this approach on a firm theoretical
footing.

*Yinhui Ma,Tomomasa Yamasaki,Zhehui Wang,Tao Luo,Bo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Coflex, a HW-NAS framework incorporating Sparse Gaussian Process and multi-objective Bayesian optimization for efficient neural network and hardware co-optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of extensive search space and high computational costs in HW-NAS for developing efficient DNN accelerators.

Method: Coflex utilizes Sparse Gaussian Process and multi-objective Bayesian optimization to scale optimization efficiently by reducing kernel complexity and computational overhead.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate Coflex's superior accuracy and Energy-Delay-Product compared to existing methods, with computational speed-ups of 1.9x to 9.5x.

Conclusion: Coflex provides a scalable and efficient solution for HW-NAS, enhancing predictive accuracy and reducing computational demands for neural architectures on edge devices.

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) is an efficient approach
to automatically co-optimizing neural network performance and hardware energy
efficiency, making it particularly useful for the development of Deep Neural
Network accelerators on the edge. However, the extensive search space and high
computational cost pose significant challenges to its practical adoption. To
address these limitations, we propose Coflex, a novel HW-NAS framework that
integrates the Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) with multi-objective Bayesian
optimization. By leveraging sparse inducing points, Coflex reduces the GP
kernel complexity from cubic to near-linear with respect to the number of
training samples, without compromising optimization performance. This enables
scalable approximation of large-scale search space, substantially decreasing
computational overhead while preserving high predictive accuracy. We evaluate
the efficacy of Coflex across various benchmarks, focusing on
accelerator-specific architecture. Our experi- mental results show that Coflex
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of network accuracy and
Energy-Delay-Product, while achieving a computational speed-up ranging from
1.9x to 9.5x.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generalized manifold-regularized $\ell_p$-SVDD method with signature kernels for improved time series anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance time series anomaly detection by leveraging the geometric structure of data distributions and incorporating manifold regularization.

Method: Developed a manifold-regularized $\ell_p$-SVDD algorithm that utilizes the signature kernel; optimized based on an existing Representer theorem; analyzed generalization through Rademacher complexities.

Result: Conducted theoretical analysis on generalization and experimentally demonstrated superior performance across various datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach effectively integrates structural information and time series complexities for enhanced anomaly detection, outperforming other techniques.

Abstract: We generalise the recently introduced large-margin $\ell_p$-SVDD approach to
exploit the geometry of data distribution via manifold regularising and a
signature kernel representation for time series anomaly detection.
Specifically, we formulate a manifold-regularised variant of the $\ell_p$-SVDD
method to encourage label smoothness on the underlying manifold to capture
structural information for improved detection performance. Drawing on an
existing Representer theorem, we then provide an effective optimisation
technique for the proposed method and show that it can benefit from the
signature kernel to capture time series complexities for anomaly detection.
  We theoretically study the proposed approach using Rademacher complexities to
analyse its generalisation performance and also provide an experimental
assessment of the proposed method across various data sets to compare its
performance against other methods.

Abstract: Objective. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent
non-communicable chronic disease that substantially reduces life expectancy.
Accurate estimation of all-cause mortality risk in T2DM patients is crucial for
personalizing and optimizing treatment strategies. Research Design and Methods.
This study analyzed a cohort of 554 patients (aged 40-87 years) with diagnosed
T2DM over a maximum follow-up period of 16.8 years, during which 202 patients
(36%) died. Key survival-associated features were identified, and multiple
machine learning (ML) models were trained and validated to predict all-cause
mortality risk. To improve model interpretability, Shapley additive
explanations (SHAP) was applied to the best-performing model. Results. The
extra survival trees (EST) model, incorporating ten key features, demonstrated
the best predictive performance. The model achieved a C-statistic of 0.776,

0.86, 0.80, 0.841, and 0.826 for 5-, 10-, 15-, and 16.8-year all-cause
mortality predictions, respectively. The SHAP approach was employed to
interpret the model's individual decision-making processes. Conclusions. The
developed model exhibited strong predictive performance for mortality risk
assessment. Its clinically interpretable outputs enable potential bedside

timely treatment optimization.

### [234] [Incorporating structural uncertainty in causal decision making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23495)
*Maurits Kaptein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the importance of addressing structural uncertainty in causal inference when making decisions, highlighting scenarios where Bayesian model averaging can be beneficial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in practice where structural uncertainty in causal relationships is often ignored, despite its potential to significantly impact decision-making outcomes.

Method: The method involves Bayesian model averaging for competing causal structures ($X \rightarrow Y$ vs. $X \leftarrow Y$) and establishing conditions where it is optimal, supported by proofs, simulations, and leveraging causal discovery methods.

Result: The paper identifies conditions—such as moderate to high structural uncertainty, substantial differences in causal effects, and sensitive loss functions—under which model averaging improves decision-making.

Conclusion: Incorporating structural uncertainty into causal inference enhances decision-making and complements existing robust inference methods by addressing overlooked uncertainty sources.

Abstract: Practitioners making decisions based on causal effects typically ignore
structural uncertainty. We analyze when this uncertainty is consequential
enough to warrant methodological solutions (Bayesian model averaging over
competing causal structures). Focusing on bivariate relationships ($X
\rightarrow Y$ vs. $X \leftarrow Y$), we establish that model averaging is
beneficial when: (1) structural uncertainty is moderate to high, (2) causal
effects differ substantially between structures, and (3) loss functions are
sufficiently sensitive to the size of the causal effect. We prove optimality
results of our suggested methodological solution under regularity conditions
and demonstrate through simulations that modern causal discovery methods can
provide, within limits, the necessary quantification. Our framework complements
existing robust causal inference approaches by addressing a distinct source of
uncertainty typically overlooked in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the relationship between the length of certificates and the verifier's runtime, proving a necessary trade-off between the two.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study originates from the need to understand how computational trade-offs affect verification efficiency and the implications for complexity classes.

Method: The authors propose and prove the Verifier Trade-off Theorem, establishing the minimum certificate length required to reduce verification time.

Result: The theorem defines a hierarchy of certificate complexity and offers insights into the separation of complexity classes. Applications to problems like string periodicity and rotation detection are demonstrated.

Conclusion: The study sheds new light on longstanding complexity questions like the P vs. NP problem, linking them to sub-linear certificate analysis.

Abstract: We investigate the trade-off between certificate length and verifier runtime.
We prove a Verifier Trade-off Theorem showing that reducing the inherent
verification time of a language from \(f(n)\) to \(g(n)\), where \(f(n) \ge
g(n)\), requires certificates of length at least \(\Omega(\log(f(n) / g(n)))\).
This theorem induces a natural hierarchy based on certificate complexity. We
demonstrate its applicability to analyzing conjectured separations between
complexity classes (e.g., \(\np\) and \(\exptime\)) and to studying natural
problems such as string periodicity and rotation detection. Additionally, we
provide perspectives on the \(\p\) vs. \(\np\) problem by relating it to the
existence of sub-linear certificates.

*Saleh Vatan Khah,Savelii Chezhegov,Shahrokh Farahmand,Samuel Horváth,Eduard Gorbunov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a high-probability convergence analysis for Differential Privacy (DP)-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping threshold, showing improvements in convergence speed and privacy trade-offs under heavy-tailed noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient clipping is essential in deep learning for high-probability convergence in stochastic methods and is crucial in Differential Privacy mechanisms, but existing analyses require incompatible variable clipping thresholds.

Method: The paper analyzes DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping level under convex and non-convex smooth optimization, using a bounded central α-th moment assumption for heavy-tailed noise.

Result: The analysis shows that DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping level converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution faster than existing methods, with an adjustable trade-off between convergence and privacy.

Conclusion: This research bridges the gap between fixed clipping thresholds and DP requirements, offering a promising improvement for privacy-preserving optimization in deep learning.

Abstract: Gradient clipping is a fundamental tool in Deep Learning, improving the
high-probability convergence of stochastic first-order methods like SGD,
AdaGrad, and Adam under heavy-tailed noise, which is common in training large
language models. It is also a crucial component of Differential Privacy (DP)
mechanisms. However, existing high-probability convergence analyses typically
require the clipping threshold to increase with the number of optimization
steps, which is incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian
mechanism. In this work, we close this gap by providing the first
high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping
level, applicable to both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under
heavy-tailed noise, characterized by a bounded central $\alpha$-th moment
assumption, $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our results show that, with a fixed clipping
level, the method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution with a
faster rate than the existing ones. The neighborhood can be balanced against
the noise introduced by DP, providing a refined trade-off between convergence
speed and privacy guarantees.

### [237] [Continual Learning with Synthetic Boundary Experience Blending](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23534)
*Chih-Fan Hsu,Ming-Ching Chang,Wei-Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework for continual learning called 'Experience Blending,' which uses synthetic boundary data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. The method achieves significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the issue of catastrophic forgetting in continual learning models, where models trained sequentially on tasks often simplify decision boundaries and lose prior knowledge.

Method: Proposes an 'Experience Blending' framework with two components: (1) multivariate differential privacy noise to generate synthetic boundary data (SBD), and (2) a training approach combining stored key samples and SBD to stabilize boundaries.

Result: Demonstrates improvements on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets, achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively, compared to nine baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances decision boundary stability and mitigates forgetting in continual learning, outperforming existing approaches and validating its utility.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to address catastrophic forgetting in models
trained sequentially on multiple tasks. While experience replay has shown
promise, its effectiveness is often limited by the sparse distribution of
stored key samples, leading to overly simplified decision boundaries. We
hypothesize that introducing synthetic data near the decision boundary
(Synthetic Boundary Data, or SBD) during training serves as an implicit
regularizer, improving boundary stability and mitigating forgetting. To
validate this hypothesis, we propose a novel training framework, {\bf
Experience Blending}, which integrates knowledge from both stored key samples
and synthetic, boundary-adjacent data. Experience blending consists of two core
components: (1) a multivariate Differential Privacy (DP) noise mechanism that
injects batch-wise noise into low-dimensional feature representations,
generating SBD; and (2) an end-to-end training strategy that jointly leverages
both stored key samples and SBD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our method outperforms nine CL baselines,
achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

*Georg Slamanig,Francesco Corti,Olga Saukh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks and analyzes parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for small convolutional neural networks used in resource-constrained edge environments, focusing on LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the underexplored application of PEFT methods for small models typically deployed in edge devices, optimizing for computational efficiency while maintaining effectiveness.

Method: The researchers evaluated several PEFT methods on convolutional architectures, examined their update behavior across different rank dimensions, and used PyTorch profilers to compare model performance and computational costs against traditional fine-tuning.

Result: PEFT methods are significantly less memory-efficient for depthwise-separable convolutional architectures but can reduce floating-point operations by up to 95% when applied to edge-optimized architectures.

Conclusion: The insights help guide the choice of PEFT methods based on specific hardware, performance, and application needs, highlighting the trade-offs in resource efficiency and update behaviors.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods reduce the computational costs
of updating deep learning models by minimizing the number of additional
parameters used to adapt a model to a down- stream task. While extensively
researched in large language models (LLMs), their application to smaller models
used on edge devices, such as convolutional neural networks, remains
underexplored. This paper benchmarks and analyzes popular PEFT methods on
convolutional architectures typically deployed in resource-constrained edge
environments. We evaluate LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore for updating standard and
depthwise convolutional architectures to handle distribution shifts and
accommodate unseen classes. We utilize recently proposed PyTorch profilers to
compare the updated model performance and computational costs of these PEFT
methods with traditional fine-tuning approaches. With resource efficiency in
mind, we investigate their update behavior across different rank dimensions. We
find that the evaluated PEFT methods are only half as memory-efficient when
applied to depthwise-separable convolution architectures, compared to their
efficiency with LLMs. Conversely, when targeting convolu- tional architectures
optimized for edge deployment, adapter-based PEFT methods can reduce floating
point operations (FLOPs) during model updates by up to 95%. These insights
offer valuable guidance for selecting PEFT methods based on hardware
constraints, performance requirements, and application needs. Our code is

*Piotr Indyk,Michael Kapralov,Kshiteej Sheth,Tal Wagner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents the first subquadratic-time algorithm for approximate matrix-vector products specifically tailored to asymmetric Gaussian Kernel matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by the need to efficiently process attention matrices in machine learning applications, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs).

Method: The proposed algorithm utilizes the property that the sum of entries in Gaussian Kernel matrices scales linearly with matrix size, leveraging this assumption to achieve fast computations.

Result: The algorithm achieves subquadratic computation time for Gaussian Kernel matrices, validated experimentally in instances like attention operations in LLMs.

Conclusion: By leveraging a linear scaling assumption for Gaussian Kernel matrices, the paper introduces an efficient algorithm that significantly accelerates matrix-vector product computations without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of fast processing of attention matrices, we study
fast algorithms for computing matrix-vector products for asymmetric Gaussian
Kernel matrices $K\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. $K$'s columns are indexed by a
set of $n$ keys $k_1,k_2\ldots, k_n\in \mathbb{R}^d$, rows by a set of $n$
queries $q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_n\in \mathbb{R}^d $, and its $i,j$ entry is $K_{ij} =
e^{-\|q_i-k_j\|_2^2/2\sigma^2}$ for some bandwidth parameter $\sigma>0$. Given
a vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and error parameter $\epsilon>0$, our task is to
output a $y\in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\|Kx-y\|_2\leq \epsilon \|x\|_2$ in
time subquadratic in $n$ and linear in $d$. Our algorithms rely on the
following modelling assumption about the matrices $K$: the sum of the entries
of $K$ scales linearly in $n$, as opposed to worst case quadratic growth. We
validate this assumption experimentally, for Gaussian kernel matrices
encountered in various settings such as fast attention computation in LLMs. We
obtain the first subquadratic-time algorithm that works under this assumption,
for unrestricted vectors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphRAG-R1 is proposed as an adaptive GraphRAG framework to enhance multi-hop reasoning by training LLMs using process-constrained outcome-based reinforcement learning, addressing limitations of heuristic-based GraphRAG methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GraphRAG methods struggle with multi-hop reasoning due to reliance on pre-defined heuristics during query and retrieval phases, limiting their ability to fully utilize LLM reasoning potential.

Method: The authors propose GraphRAG-R1, incorporating Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with rollout-thinking, process-constrained rewards (Progressive Retrieval Attenuation and Cost-Aware F1), and a phase-dependent training strategy. A hybrid graph-textual retrieval mechanism is also employed.

Result: GraphRAG-R1 demonstrates superior reasoning capabilities over state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, while being compatible with existing retrieval methods for consistent improvements.

Conclusion: GraphRAG-R1 effectively addresses bottlenecks in multi-hop reasoning by enhancing LLM capabilities and enabling adaptable integration with various retrieval methods, proving its merit experimentally.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has shown great effectiveness
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs by leveraging graph structures for
knowledge representation and modeling complex real-world relationships.
However, existing GraphRAG methods still face significant bottlenecks when
handling complex problems that require multi-hop reasoning, as their query and
retrieval phases are largely based on pre-defined heuristics and do not fully
utilize the reasoning potentials of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose
GraphRAG-R1, an adaptive GraphRAG framework by training LLMs with
process-constrained outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the
multi-hop reasoning ability. Our method can decompose complex problems,
autonomously invoke retrieval tools to acquire necessary information, and
perform effective reasoning. Specifically, we utilize a modified version of
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that supports rollout-with-thinking
capability. Next, we design two process-constrained reward functions. To handle
the shallow retrieval problem, we design a Progressive Retrieval Attenuation
(PRA) reward to encourage essential retrievals. Then, to handle the
over-thinking problem, we design Cost-Aware F1 (CAF) reward to balance the
model performance with computational costs. We further design a phase-dependent
training strategy, containing three training stages corresponding to cold start
and these two rewards. Lastly, our method adopts a hybrid graph-textual
retrieval to improve the reasoning capacity. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that GraphRAG-R1 boosts LLM capabilities in solving complex
reasoning problems compared to state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, our framework can be
flexibly integrated with various existing retrieval methods, consistently
delivering performance improvements.

*Yu-Tang Chang,Shih-Fang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces EB-gMCR, an energy-based deep learning method for signal unmixing, showcasing its reliability and scalability in decomposing chemical signals without requiring predefined component counts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are scalability and reliability challenges in matrix factorization-based multivariate curve resolution (MCR), especially when data size or component count is high. This paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The study reformulates MCR as a generative model and implements EB-gMCR, an energy-based deep learning solver that starts with a large pool of candidates and uses a gating network to identify active components.

Result: EB-gMCR achieved high precision in recovering component counts and concentration estimates, maintaining R^2 >= 0.98 in noisy datasets, and near-perfect performance with R^2 >= 0.99 under lower noise.

Conclusion: EB-gMCR unites advanced generative modeling with automatic component selection to enable scalable, reliable signal unmixing. It adapts to various chemical and biological contexts easily via plug-in priors, providing practical tools for large-scale analysis.

Abstract: Signal unmixing analysis decomposes data into basic patterns and is widely
applied in chemical and biological research. Multivariate curve resolution
(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base
patterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in
understanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix
factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually
unknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the
scalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This
study reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an
energy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the
smallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts
from a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable
gating network to retain only active components while estimating their
concentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent
sources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count
within 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near
exact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity
or nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to
other instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By
uniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR
offers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including
chemical library-driven scenarios. The source code is available at

*Tommaso Marzi,Cesare Alippi,Andrea Cini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework for decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) that combines communication and hierarchical learning, addressing challenges like partial observability and non-stationarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of partial observability and non-stationarity in decentralized MARL by exploring the combination of communication and hierarchical decision-making, which has been insufficiently studied.

Method: The approach uses a feudal HRL framework with a hierarchical graph structure, where higher levels set goals for lower levels, and neighboring agents exchange messages. A novel reward-assignment mechanism is designed to train policies effectively by maximizing the advantage function of upper levels.

Result: The proposed methodology demonstrates superior performance on relevant MARL benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art approaches, indicating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The introduction of hierarchical message-passing policies within a decentralized MARL framework successfully enhances coordination and learning, mitigating existing challenges.

Abstract: Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods allow for
learning scalable multi-agent policies, but suffer from partial observability
and induced non-stationarity. These challenges can be addressed by introducing
mechanisms that facilitate coordination and high-level planning. Specifically,
coordination and temporal abstraction can be achieved through communication
(e.g., message passing) and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)
approaches to decision-making. However, optimization issues limit the
applicability of hierarchical policies to multi-agent systems. As such, the
combination of these approaches has not been fully explored. To fill this void,
we propose a novel and effective methodology for learning multi-agent
hierarchies of message-passing policies. We adopt the feudal HRL framework and
rely on a hierarchical graph structure for planning and coordination among
agents. Agents at lower levels in the hierarchy receive goals from the upper
levels and exchange messages with neighboring agents at the same level. To
learn hierarchical multi-agent policies, we design a novel reward-assignment
method based on training the lower-level policies to maximize the advantage
function associated with the upper levels. Results on relevant benchmarks show
that our method performs favorably compared to the state of the art.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new deep learning-based method to predict patient enrollment in clinical trials by integrating pre-trained language models and tabular features, enhanced with a probabilistic layer for range estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately predicting patient enrollment is challenging but crucial for clinical trial success due to its direct impact on planning and resource allocation.

Method: The method utilizes a neural network model that combines pre-trained language models for clinical document representation with tabular features via an attention mechanism, and incorporates a probabilistic Gamma distribution layer for uncertainty estimation.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms established baseline methods in predicting patient enrollment across sites.

Conclusion: The proposed model provides an effective solution for predicting patient enrollment in clinical trials, aiding in better planning and execution of trials, with strong performance demonstrated on real-world data.

Abstract: Clinical trials are a systematic endeavor to assess the safety and efficacy
of new drugs or treatments. Conducting such trials typically demands
significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need
for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient
enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges
during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based
method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural
network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the
complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into
expressive representations. These representations are then combined with
encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for
uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a
probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range
estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration,
assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out
extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the
proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a
number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline
models.

Motivation: Data augmentation for time series analysis faces challenges in preserving the intrinsic properties of datasets while enabling diverse transformations. The paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a generative model for controlled and reliable augmentation.

Method: The L-GTA model employs a transformer-based variational recurrent autoencoder, enabling controlled transformations within its latent space. This allows for generating new time series that maintain the properties of the original data, using transformations like jittering and magnitude warping.

Result: L-GTA was evaluated on several real-world datasets and shown to produce augmented data that are more reliable, consistent, and controllable. This augmentation led to significant improvements in predictive accuracy and similarity measures compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed L-GTA model offers a robust framework for generating synthetic time series data with enhanced reliability and precision, facilitating advancements in tasks like forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection.

Abstract: Data augmentation is gaining importance across various aspects of time series
analysis, from forecasting to classification and anomaly detection tasks. We
introduce the Latent Generative Transformer Augmentation (L-GTA) model, a
generative approach using a transformer-based variational recurrent
autoencoder. This model uses controlled transformations within the latent space
of the model to generate new time series that preserve the intrinsic properties
of the original dataset. L-GTA enables the application of diverse
transformations, ranging from simple jittering to magnitude warping, and
combining these basic transformations to generate more complex synthetic time
series datasets. Our evaluation of several real-world datasets demonstrates the
ability of L-GTA to produce more reliable, consistent, and controllable
augmented data. This translates into significant improvements in predictive
accuracy and similarity measures compared to direct transformation methods.

### [246] [On the Expressiveness of Softmax Attention: A Recurrent Neural Network Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23632)
*Gabriel Mongaras,Eric C. Larson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines why softmax attention, despite its quadratic complexity, outperforms linear attention by framing it in the context of recurrent neural networks (RNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore the underlying reasons why softmax attention performs better than linear attention, which has been widely recognized but remains insufficiently understood.

Method: They derive the recurrent form of softmax attention, interpreting it as an RNN, and perform component ablations to investigate the contributions of each part.

Result: The study demonstrates that softmax attention's expressiveness stems from its unique components, which linear attention fails to replicate.

Conclusion: This framework explains the fundamental strengths of softmax attention and solidifies its importance in transformer architecture design for high performance.

Abstract: Since its introduction, softmax attention has become the backbone of modern
transformer architectures due to its expressiveness and scalability across a
wide range of tasks. However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the
quadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the
sequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and
similar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of
softmax attention. Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from
the original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream
accuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and
key inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other
nonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains
unanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of
softmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention. Using
this form, each part of softmax attention can be described in the language of
recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Describing softmax attention as an RNN allows
for the ablation of the components of softmax attention to understand the
importance of each part and how they interact. In this way, our work helps
explain why softmax attention is more expressive than its counterparts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve federated learning resilience to Byzantine attacks and statistical heterogeneity.

Method: Proposes OptiGradTrust framework using six-dimensional gradient fingerprinting and FedBN-Prox for adaptive trust scoring and stable convergence.

Result: Demonstrated accuracy improvements in MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Alzheimer's datasets under attack scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art defenses.

Conclusion: The framework combines robust defense mechanisms and adaptive learning strategies to significantly enhance federated learning performance under heterogeneous and adversarial conditions.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed medical institutions while preserving patient privacy, but remains
vulnerable to Byzantine attacks and statistical heterogeneity. We present
OptiGradTrust, a comprehensive defense framework that evaluates gradient
updates through a novel six-dimensional fingerprint including VAE
reconstruction error, cosine similarity metrics, $L_2$ norm, sign-consistency
ratio, and Monte Carlo Shapley value, which drive a hybrid RL-attention module
for adaptive trust scoring. To address convergence challenges under data
heterogeneity, we develop FedBN-Prox (FedBN-P), combining Federated Batch
Normalization with proximal regularization for optimal accuracy-convergence
trade-offs. Extensive evaluation across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Alzheimer's MRI
datasets under various Byzantine attack scenarios demonstrates significant
improvements over state-of-the-art defenses, achieving up to +1.6 percentage
points over FLGuard under non-IID conditions while maintaining robust
performance against diverse attack patterns through our adaptive learning
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature attribution methods, like SHAP, are widely used for interpreting machine learning models but have not been explored for their potential to guide model optimization.

Method: The authors propose a framework utilizing entropy-based penalties to enforce sparse and stable feature attributions during training, applied to tree-based models using TreeSHAP.

Result: Experimental analyses on regression and classification benchmarks reveal improved generalization, robust feature attributions, and enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: The technique successfully enhances machine learning models' predictive accuracy and reliability through explainability-driven regularization.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have
become instrumental in understanding machine learning models, but their role in
guiding model optimization remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a
SHAP-guided regularization framework that incorporates feature importance
constraints into model training to enhance both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our approach applies entropy-based penalties to encourage
sparse, concentrated feature attributions while promoting stability across
samples. The framework is applicable to both regression and classification
tasks. Our first exploration started with investigating a tree-based model
regularization using TreeSHAP. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
regression and classification datasets, we demonstrate that our method improves
generalization performance while ensuring robust and interpretable feature
attributions. The proposed technique offers a novel, explainability-driven
regularization approach, making machine learning models both more accurate and
more reliable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional caching methods struggle with retaining relevance in chatbot interactions due to personalization and limited semantic search accuracy.

Method: TweakLLM introduces a lightweight LLM-driven routing strategy to adapt cached responses dynamically to incoming queries.

Result: Evaluations, including user studies and LLM debates, show TweakLLM maintains comparable response quality while significantly enhancing caching efficiency.

Conclusion: TweakLLM offers an efficient, scalable solution for cost-friendly and user-centric LLM deployments, maintaining response quality and user satisfaction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making
efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and
latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach
proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the
limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present
TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to
dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive
evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction
voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM
maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly
improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight
TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM
deployments without compromising user experience.

*Tianyi Chen,Haitong Ma,Na Li,Kai Wang,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an online RL algorithm, Flow Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD), that enables fast 1-step sampling for diffusion policy models, maintaining performance while reducing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion policies, while successful in reinforcement learning, suffer from slow iterative sampling processes, which limit their responsiveness during inference.

Method: The authors introduced Flow Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD), utilizing the theoretical link between distribution variance and discretization error in flow matching models. They implemented two variants of the algorithm – one using flow policy and the other MeanFlow policy, without needing extra distillation or consistency training.

Result: Empirical evaluations on MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrated that FPMD achieves performance comparable to diffusion policy baselines but with dramatically fewer function evaluations (hundreds of times fewer) during inference.

Conclusion: FPMD offers a fast, effective solution for policy inference in reinforcement learning, combining efficiency and performance without additional training overhead.

Abstract: Diffusion policies have achieved great success in online reinforcement
learning (RL) due to their strong expressive capacity. However, the inference
of diffusion policy models relies on a slow iterative sampling process, which
limits their responsiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow
Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD), an online RL algorithm that enables 1-step
sampling during policy inference. Our approach exploits a theoretical
connection between the distribution variance and the discretization error of
single-step sampling in straight interpolation flow matching models, and
requires no extra distillation or consistency training. We present two
algorithm variants based on flow policy and MeanFlow policy parametrizations,
respectively. Extensive empirical evaluations on MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate
that our algorithms show strong performance comparable to diffusion policy
baselines while requiring hundreds of times fewer function evaluations during
inference.

*Rabeya Tus Sadia,Qiang Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DepMicroDiff proposes a novel imputation approach for microbiome data by leveraging advanced generative modeling and context-aware learning, significantly outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges caused by the inherent sparsity and noise in microbiome data, which affect imputation accuracy and downstream applications like biomarker discovery.

Method: DepMicroDiff integrates a diffusion-based generative model with a Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT) to model pairwise and autoregressive relationships. It also employs VAE-based pretraining and utilizes patient metadata encoded with a large language model for context.

Result: On TCGA microbiome datasets, DepMicroDiff achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with notable improvements in Pearson correlation (up to 0.712), cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and reductions in RMSE and MAE across various cancer types.

Conclusion: DepMicroDiff demonstrates robustness and generalizability for microbiome data imputation, making it highly beneficial for applications like biomarker identification and health studies.

Abstract: Microbiome data analysis is essential for understanding host health and
disease, yet its inherent sparsity and noise pose major challenges for accurate
imputation, hindering downstream tasks such as biomarker discovery. Existing
imputation methods, including recent diffusion-based models, often fail to
capture the complex interdependencies between microbial taxa and overlook
contextual metadata that can inform imputation. We introduce DepMicroDiff, a
novel framework that combines diffusion-based generative modeling with a
Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT) to explicitly capture both mutual pairwise
dependencies and autoregressive relationships. DepMicroDiff is further enhanced
by VAE-based pretraining across diverse cancer datasets and conditioning on
patient metadata encoded via a large language model (LLM). Experiments on TCGA
microbiome datasets show that DepMicroDiff substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712),
cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE and MAE across multiple cancer
types, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability for microbiome
imputation.

*Aymane Abdali,Bartosz Boguslawski,Lucas Drumetz,Vincent Gripon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores how anomalous samples can be used in training binary anomaly classification models using multi-score detection and recent techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the utility of anomalous samples in scenarios with limited annotated data and to determine their effectiveness in anomaly classification.

Method: The paper combines Zero-Shot and memory-based techniques in a multi-score anomaly detection framework, pairs this with an augmentation-based validation strategy to optimize score aggregation.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method's effectiveness on popular industrial anomaly detection datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating anomalous samples and using the proposed validation and detection techniques provides valuable benefits for anomaly classification in Few-Shot settings.

Abstract: Several anomaly detection and classification methods rely on large amounts of
non-anomalous or "normal" samples under the assump- tion that anomalous data is
typically harder to acquire. This hypothesis becomes questionable in Few-Shot
settings, where as little as one anno- tated sample can make a significant
difference. In this paper, we tackle the question of utilizing anomalous
samples in training a model for bi- nary anomaly classification. We propose a
methodology that incorporates anomalous samples in a multi-score anomaly
detection score leveraging recent Zero-Shot and memory-based techniques. We
compare the utility of anomalous samples to that of regular samples and study
the benefits and limitations of each. In addition, we propose an
augmentation-based validation technique to optimize the aggregation of the
different anomaly scores and demonstrate its effectiveness on popular
industrial anomaly detection datasets.

### [253] [Improving annotator selection in Active Learning using a mood and fatigue-aware Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23756)
*Diana Mortagua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method in Active Learning (AL) leveraging annotators' past accuracy, mood, and fatigue levels through a Knowledge-Based Recommendation System to improve labeling efficiency and reduce errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in Active Learning by considering human annotators’ internal factors like mood and fatigue, which significantly affect labeling accuracy.

Method: A Knowledge-Based Recommendation System ranks annotators based on their past accuracy, mood, fatigue, and the instance characteristics to minimize annotation errors during labeling.

Result: The proposed approach led to fewer annotation errors, reduced model uncertainty, and improved accuracy and F1-scores compared to methods ignoring internal factors.

Conclusion: Incorporating human cognitive factors into Active Learning enhances the efficiency and accuracy of annotations, marking a step forward in addressing human-centered issues in machine labeling.

Abstract: This study centers on overcoming the challenge of selecting the best
annotators for each query in Active Learning (AL), with the objective of
minimizing misclassifications. AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and
time when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data
needed. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors,
aiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster.
Most strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that
affect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels.
This work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only
considering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue
levels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a
Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available
annotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using
their past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as
information about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing
literature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating
annotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS.
The results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and
fatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators,
and the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not
using internal factors. Accuracy and F1-score values were also better in the
proposed approach, despite not being as substantial as the aforementioned. The
methodologies and findings presented in this study begin to explore the open
challenge of human cognitive factors affecting AL.

*Justin Kay,Grant Van Horn,Subhransu Maji,Daniel Sheldon,Sara Beery*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CODA, a method for active model selection, which uses a probabilistic framework to prioritize data labeling based on consensus and disagreement among models, significantly reducing annotation effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model selection often requires costly and time-intensive data annotation for creating validation datasets.

Method: CODA employs a consensus-driven, probabilistic framework to guide data labeling by leveraging model agreements and disagreements, updating beliefs via Bayesian inference.

Result: CODA reduces annotation effort by over 70% in discovering the best model compared to previous state-of-the-art methods across 26 benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed CODA framework provides a more efficient and effective approach to model selection, minimizing labeling requirements while improving performance.

Abstract: The widespread availability of off-the-shelf machine learning models poses a
challenge: which model, of the many available candidates, should be chosen for
a given data analysis task? This question of model selection is traditionally
answered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and
time-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using
predictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data
points that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA,
performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships
between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic
framework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in
the candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian
inference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is
collected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark
tasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing
methods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation
effort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the
previous state-of-the-art. Code and data are available at

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This study refines a novel neuron model by revealing its dual functionality as a signal propagator and generator while showcasing how external signals influence its states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and enhance the functional dynamics of a previously proposed neuron model based on symmetric differential equations for broader applications in neuromorphic engineering.

Method: The authors explored parameter spaces, employed mathematical analysis to reveal system properties, and introduced an intermediate-state metric termed on-road energy while using simulations to verify findings.

Result: The study shows the neuron model has dual functional behaviors (asymptotically stable signal propagation and Lyapunov stable oscillation) and that these behaviors can transition through parameter or structure adjustments. External signals can suppress oscillations.

Conclusion: The model effectively mimics biological neurons' dual roles in information transmission and rhythm generation, laying the groundwork for applications in neuromorphic engineering.

Abstract: In our previous work, we proposed a novel neuron model based on symmetric
differential equations and demonstrated its potential as an efficient signal
propagator. Building upon that foundation, the present study delves deeper into
the intrinsic dynamics and functional diversity of this model. By
systematically exploring the parameter space and employing a range of
mathematical analysis tools, we theoretically reveal the system 's core
property of functional duality. Specifically, the model exhibits two distinct
trajectory behaviors: one is asymptotically stable, corresponding to a reliable
signal propagator; the other is Lyapunov stable, characterized by sustained
self-excited oscillations, functioning as a signal generator. To enable
effective monitoring and prediction of system states during simulations, we
introduce a novel intermediate-state metric termed on-road energy. Simulation
results confirm that transitions between the two functional modes can be
induced through parameter adjustments or modifications to the connection
structure. Moreover, we show that oscillations can be effectively suppressed by
introducing external signals. These findings draw a compelling parallel to the
dual roles of biological neurons in both information transmission and rhythm
generation, thereby establishing a solid theoretical basis and a clear
functional roadmap for the broader application of this model in neuromorphic
engineering.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper tackles the challenge of extracting thermal parameters from FDTR measurements using global optimization algorithms and proposes an AI-driven hybrid framework for faster and more reliable convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Characterizing thermal properties of multilayer thin films using FDTR involves solving a complex nonlinear inverse problem, necessitating more efficient and accurate extraction methods.

Method: The study evaluates four global optimization algorithms (GA, QGA, PSO, FWA), introduces hybrid variants incorporating local refinement methods (HGA, HQGA, HPSO, HFWA), and compares their performance.

Result: HPSO achieves the highest success rate and robustness, with 80% of trials converging within 60 seconds and consistent accuracy when extended to 1000 seconds.

Conclusion: HPSO is identified as a robust, fast solution for inverse problems in thermal metrology, outperforming other methods and offering scalability to broader model-fitting applications.

Abstract: Frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR) is a widely used technique for
characterizing thermal properties of multilayer thin films. However, extracting
multiple parameters from FDTR measurements presents a nonlinear inverse problem
due to its high dimensionality and multimodal, non-convex solution space. This
study evaluates four popular global optimization algorithms: Genetic Algorithm
(GA), Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and
Fireworks Algorithm (FWA), for extracting parameters from FDTR measurements of
a GaN/Si heterostructure. However, none achieve reliable convergence within 60
seconds. To improve convergence speed and accuracy, we propose an AI-driven
hybrid optimization framework that combines each global algorithm with a
Quasi-Newton local refinement method, resulting in four hybrid variants: HGA,
HQGA, HPSO, and HFWA. Among these, HPSO outperforms all other methods, with 80%
of trials reaching the target fitness value within 60 seconds, showing greater
robustness and a lower risk of premature convergence. In contrast, only 30% of
HGA and HQGA trials and 20% of HFWA trials achieve this threshold. We then
evaluate the worst-case performance across 100 independent trials for each
algorithm when the time is extended to 1000 seconds. Only HPSO, PSO, and HGA
consistently reach the target accuracy, with HPSO converging five times faster
than the others. HPSO provides a general-purpose solution for inverse problems
in thermal metrology and can be readily extended to other model-fitting
techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finger force estimation is critical for advancing real-time human-machine interactions, but traditional methods are computationally expensive and unsuitable for embedded systems.

Method: The authors use spike trains from motor neurons extracted from high-density EMG and process these using spiking neural networks implemented on low-power neuromorphic hardware.

Result: Achieved accurate finger-specific force predictions with low energy consumption during real-time processing.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a breakthrough in efficient, real-time finger force decoding, paving the way for innovations in prosthetics and wearable technology.

Abstract: Accurate finger force estimation is critical for next-generation
human-machine interfaces. Traditional electromyography (EMG)-based decoding
methods using deep learning require large datasets and high computational
resources, limiting their use in real-time, embedded systems. Here, we propose
a novel approach that performs finger force regression using spike trains from
individual motor neurons, extracted from high-density EMG. These biologically
grounded signals drive a spiking neural network implemented on a mixed-signal
neuromorphic processor. Unlike prior work that encodes EMG into events, our
method exploits spike timing on motor units to perform low-power, real-time
inference. This is the first demonstration of motor neuron-based continuous
regression computed directly on neuromorphic hardware. Our results confirm
accurate finger-specific force prediction with minimal energy use, opening new
possibilities for embedded decoding in prosthetics and wearable
neurotechnology.

TL;DR: The paper presents advancements in abstract interpretation, focusing on inferring bounds for recursive functions using a novel constraint-based domain, "B-bound domains," and methods for domain abstraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the challenge of deriving closed-form bounds for recursively-defined functions, which is useful in analyzing programs (e.g., cost analysis, loop acceleration) and hybrid systems governed by differential equations.

Method: The authors introduce "B-bound domains" to abstract functions using a set of boundary functions and present domain abstraction methods that lift mappings in value space to function space for dimensionality reduction.

Result: The proposed methods can infer non-linear numerical invariants, simplify transfer function design through identified convexity properties, and enable abstraction from symbolic to numerical functions.

Conclusion: The results enhance abstract interpretation frameworks by enabling the analysis of complex numerical functions, improving program and hybrid system analyses with more automated and accurate tools.

Abstract: We present theoretical and practical results on the order theory of lattices
of functions, focusing on Galois connections that abstract (sets of) functions
- a topic known as higher-order abstract interpretation.
  We are motivated by the challenge of inferring closed-form bounds on
functions which are defined recursively, i.e. as the fixed point of an operator
or, equivalently, as the solution to a functional equation. This has multiple
applications in program analysis (e.g. cost analysis, loop acceleration,
declarative language analysis) and in hybrid systems governed by differential
equations.
  Our main contribution is a new family of constraint-based abstract domains
for abstracting numerical functions, B-bound domains, which abstract a function
f by a conjunction of bounds from a preselected set of boundary functions. They
allow inferring highly non-linear numerical invariants, which classical
numerical abstract domains struggle with. We uncover a convexity property in
the constraint space that simplifies, and, in some cases, fully automates,
transfer function design.
  We also introduce domain abstraction, a functor that lifts arbitrary mappings
in value space to Galois connections in function space. This supports
abstraction from symbolic to numerical functions (i.e. size abstraction), and
enables dimensionality reduction of equations.
  We base our constructions of transfer functions on a simple operator
language, starting with sequences, and extending to more general functions,
including multivariate, piecewise, and non-discrete domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FFIs are poorly suited for dynamic workflows in modern notebook environments, requiring manual setup and lacking robust features like OOP support.

Method: Kernel-FFI utilizes source-level transformation for automatic rewriting of cross-language calls and integrates a novel side-channel communication mechanism for recursive and asynchronous operations.

Result: The proposed tool removes manual programming barriers, supports OOP constructs across languages, and introduces efficient cross-language asynchronous communication.

Conclusion: Kernel-FFI enhances multi-language interoperability in interactive notebooks, offering more seamless and productive workflows.

Abstract: Foreign Function Interfaces (FFIs) are essential for enabling
interoperability between programming languages, yet existing FFI solutions are
ill-suited for the dynamic, interactive workflows prevalent in modern notebook
environments such as Jupyter. Current approaches require extensive manual
configuration, introduce significant boilerplate, and often lack support for
recursive calls and object-oriented programming (OOP) constructs-features
critical for productive, multi-language development.
  We present Kernel-FFI, a transparent, language-agnostic framework that
enables seamless cross-language function calls and object manipulation within
interactive notebooks. Kernel-FFI employs source-level transformation to
automatically rewrite cross-language invocations, eliminating the need for
manual bindings or boilerplate. Kernel-FFI provides robust support for OOP by
enabling foreign object referencing and automatic resource management across
language boundaries. Furthermore, to address the blocking nature of Jupyter
kernels and support recursive and asynchronous foreign calls, we introduce a
novel side-channel communication mechanism. Our tool will be open-sourced and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree pruning is a labor-intensive yet essential task for maintaining productive fruit orchards, and automation could greatly improve efficiency.

Method: A visuomotor controller is developed using optical flow images from a wrist-mounted camera, trained in a realistic orchard simulation without requiring full 3D reconstruction.

Result: The approach achieves a 30% success rate in real-world experiments on V-Trellis envy trees, demonstrating promising applicability despite being half as effective as an oracle planner.

Conclusion: The robotic pruning controller is a notable advancement in automating orchard maintenance tasks, though its efficiency requires further improvement to compete with expert systems.

Abstract: Dormant tree pruning is labor-intensive but essential to maintaining modern
highly-productive fruit orchards. In this work we present a closed-loop
visuomotor controller for robotic pruning. The controller guides the cutter
through a cluttered tree environment to reach a specified cut point and ensures
the cutters are perpendicular to the branch. We train the controller using a
novel orchard simulation that captures the geometric distribution of branches
in a target apple orchard configuration. Unlike traditional methods requiring
full 3D reconstruction, our controller uses just optical flow images from a
wrist-mounted camera. We deploy our learned policy in simulation and the
real-world for an example V-Trellis envy tree with zero-shot transfer,
achieving a 30% success rate -- approximately half the performance of an oracle
planner.

TL;DR: This paper presents a fast, globally optimal algorithm for generalized robot-world and hand-eye calibration (RWHEC), suitable for multi-sensor platforms with minimal assumptions and human effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational and engineering challenges of calibrating multi-sensor systems increase with the number of sensors, leading to the need for efficient, general-purpose algorithms requiring limited environment assumptions and human input.

Method: The authors propose a generalized RWHEC formulation that estimates multiple sensor and target poses, supports monocular cameras, and includes a globally optimal algorithm along with a Lie-algebraic local solver.

Result: The method showed superior performance compared to existing solutions, with novel identifiability criteria, guarantees of global optimality for bounded errors, and efficient computation.

Conclusion: The study introduces advanced calibration tools, validated by experiments, and provides open-source algorithms to benefit the robotics community.

Abstract: Automatic extrinsic sensor calibration is a fundamental problem for
multi-sensor platforms. Reliable and general-purpose solutions should be
computationally efficient, require few assumptions about the structure of the
sensing environment, and demand little effort from human operators. Since the
engineering effort required to obtain accurate calibration parameters increases
with the number of sensors deployed, robotics researchers have pursued methods
requiring few assumptions about the sensing environment and minimal effort from
human operators. In this work, we introduce a fast and certifiably globally
optimal algorithm for solving a generalized formulation of the
$\textit{robot-world and hand-eye calibration}$ (RWHEC) problem. The
formulation of RWHEC presented is "generalized" in that it supports the
simultaneous estimation of multiple sensor and target poses, and permits the
use of monocular cameras that, alone, are unable to measure the scale of their
environments. In addition to demonstrating our method's superior performance
over existing solutions, we derive novel identifiability criteria and establish
$\textit{a priori}$ guarantees of global optimality for problem instances with
bounded measurement errors. We also introduce a complementary Lie-algebraic
local solver for RWHEC and compare its performance with our global method and
prior art. Finally, we provide a free and open-source implementation of our
algorithms and experiments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel framework for generating and executing complex quadruped robot motions using advanced motion generation and imitation learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The main motivation is to overcome limitations in reference motion data diversity, which hinders versatile locomotion in quadruped robots.

Method: The method involves a CVAE-based motion generator for synthesizing transitions between arbitrary states, embedding physical constraints and kinematic compatibility, coupled with the adversarial motion priors algorithm for validating generated motion data.

Result: The framework significantly improves velocity tracking and deployment stability in quadruped robots, enabling them to perform various gait modalities like gallop, tripod, trotting, and pacing.

Conclusion: The proposed system successfully generates and executes dynamic and complex locomotion sequences in both simulation and real-world deployment, enhancing quadruped robot performance.

Abstract: Quadruped robots face persistent challenges in achieving versatile locomotion
due to limitations in reference motion data diversity. To address these
challenges, this approach introduces an in-between motion generation based
multi-style quadruped robot locomotion framework, integrating synergistic
advances in motion generation and imitation learning. Our approach establishes
a unified pipeline addressing two fundamental aspects: First, we propose a CVAE
based motion generator, synthesizing multi-style dynamically feasible
locomotion sequences between arbitrary start and end states. By embedding
physical constraints and leveraging joint poses based phase manifold
continuity, this component produces physically plausible motions spanning
multiple gait modalities while ensuring kinematic compatibility with robotic
morphologies. Second, we adopt the adversarial motion priors algorithm. We
validate the effectiveness of generated motion data in enhancing controller
stability and improving velocity tracking performance. The proposed framework
demonstrates significant improvements in velocity tracking and deployment
stability. We successfully deploy the framework on a real-world quadruped
robot, and the experimental validation confirms the framework's capability to
generate and execute complex motion profiles, including gallop, tripod,
trotting and pacing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the rigidity and limited flexibility of existing AI-driven surgical assistance solutions, which hinder natural human-machine interaction in dynamic surgical settings.

Method: The Perception Agent utilizes speech-integrated prompt-engineered large language models, the Segmentation Anything Model (SAM), and tracking foundation models, along with a memory repository and novel segmentation mechanisms for unseen elements.

Result: The agent matches the performance of labor-intensive manual-prompting strategies in quantitative tests and shows qualitative flexibility in segmenting novel elements in a custom dataset.

Conclusion: The Perception Agent advances AI-based surgical assistance by enabling adaptive and intuitive interaction, paving the way for enhanced human-machine collaboration in surgery.

Abstract: Emerging surgical data science and robotics solutions, especially those
designed to provide assistance in situ, require natural human-machine
interfaces to fully unlock their potential in providing adaptive and intuitive
aid. Contemporary AI-driven solutions remain inherently rigid, offering limited
flexibility and restricting natural human-machine interaction in dynamic
surgical environments. These solutions rely heavily on extensive task-specific
pre-training, fixed object categories, and explicit manual-prompting. This work
introduces a novel Perception Agent that leverages speech-integrated
prompt-engineered large language models (LLMs), segment anything model (SAM),
and any-point tracking foundation models to enable a more natural human-machine
interaction in real-time intraoperative surgical assistance. Incorporating a
memory repository and two novel mechanisms for segmenting unseen elements,
Perception Agent offers the flexibility to segment both known and unseen
elements in the surgical scene through intuitive interaction. Incorporating the
ability to memorize novel elements for use in future surgeries, this work takes
a marked step towards human-machine symbiosis in surgical procedures. Through
quantitative analysis on a public dataset, we show that the performance of our
agent is on par with considerably more labor-intensive manual-prompting
strategies. Qualitatively, we show the flexibility of our agent in segmenting
novel elements (instruments, phantom grafts, and gauze) in a custom-curated
dataset. By offering natural human-machine interaction and overcoming rigidity,
our Perception Agent potentially brings AI-based real-time assistance in
dynamic surgical environments closer to reality.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces MTBench, a massively parallelized benchmark for multi-task reinforcement learning in robotics, leveraging GPU-accelerated simulation to facilitate diverse and faster evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing multi-task reinforcement learning research, particularly the underutilization of on-policy algorithms in high-parallelization settings.

Method: MTBench combines GPU-accelerated simulation with a benchmark of 70 robotics tasks, supporting various RL algorithms and architectures for performance evaluation.

Result: Extensive tests show MTBench accelerates evaluation of MTRL approaches while exposing challenges in combining massive parallelism with MTRL.

Conclusion: MTBench significantly advances MTRL research by enabling faster, diverse evaluations with high-parallelization, identifying areas for improvement in future applications.

Abstract: Multi-task Reinforcement Learning (MTRL) has emerged as a critical training
paradigm for applying reinforcement learning (RL) to a set of complex
real-world robotic tasks, which demands a generalizable and robust policy. At
the same time, \emph{massively parallelized training} has gained popularity,
not only for significantly accelerating data collection through GPU-accelerated
simulation but also for enabling diverse data collection across multiple tasks
by simulating heterogeneous scenes in parallel. However, existing MTRL research
has largely been limited to off-policy methods like SAC in the
low-parallelization regime. MTRL could capitalize on the higher asymptotic
performance of on-policy algorithms, whose batches require data from the
current policy, and as a result, take advantage of massive parallelization
offered by GPU-accelerated simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
massively parallelized $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{T}$ask $\textbf{Bench}$mark
for robotics (MTBench), an open-sourced benchmark featuring a broad
distribution of 50 manipulation tasks and 20 locomotion tasks, implemented
using the GPU-accelerated simulator IsaacGym. MTBench also includes four base
RL algorithms combined with seven state-of-the-art MTRL algorithms and
architectures, providing a unified framework for evaluating their performance.
Our extensive experiments highlight the superior speed of evaluating MTRL
approaches using MTBench, while also uncovering unique challenges that arise
from combining massive parallelism with MTRL. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the stability and maneuverability of legged robots by leveraging thrusters for dynamic posture manipulation.

Method: The study used a simulation of the Husky Beta robot with thrusters on its sagittal knee joints, employing a centroidal dynamics model and QP solver within a model predictive control framework.

Result: The simulation showcased the robot's ability to stably walk on narrow paths and recover from lateral pushes by utilizing thrusters.

Conclusion: Thruster-equipped quadruped robots like Husky Beta can achieve improved stability and adaptability during complex locomotion tasks.

Abstract: There has been significant advancement in legged robot's agility where they
can show impressive acrobatic maneuvers, such as parkour. These maneuvers rely
heavily on posture manipulation. To expand the stability and locomotion
plasticity, we use the multi-modal ability in our legged-aerial platform, the
Husky Beta, to perform thruster-assisted walking. This robot has thrusters on
each of its sagittal knee joints which can be used to stabilize its frontal
dynamic as it walks. In this work, we perform a simulation study of quadruped
narrow-path walking with Husky $\beta$, where the robot will utilize its
thrusters to stably walk on a narrow path. The controller is designed based on
a centroidal dynamics model with thruster and foot ground contact forces as
inputs. These inputs are regulated using a QP solver to be used in a model
predictive control framework. In addition to narrow-path walking, we also
perform a lateral push-recovery simulation to study how the thrusters can be
used to stabilize the frontal dynamics.

*Loris Schneider,Marc Ungen,Elias Huber,Jan-Felix Klein*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a simulation-based method to optimize robotic motion sequences in reconfigurable multi-robot cells, reducing assembly time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in generating coordinated and optimized multi-robot motion sequences for reconfigurable assemblies.

Method: The paper uses a simulation framework that separates assembly into core and traverse operations. It integrates optimization techniques and a decomposition-based motion planning strategy.

Result: Efficient and collision-free multi-robot assembly procedures were produced, outperforming decentralized motion planning in simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully optimizes multi-robot motion sequences, demonstrating its effectiveness in simulation-based scenarios.

Abstract: Reconfigurable multi-robot cells offer a promising approach to meet
fluctuating assembly demands. However, the recurrent planning of their
configurations introduces new challenges, particularly in generating optimized,
coordinated multi-robot motion sequences that minimize the assembly duration.
This work presents a simulation-based method for generating such optimized
sequences. The approach separates assembly steps into task-related core
operations and connecting traverse operations. While core operations are
constrained and predetermined, traverse operations offer substantial
optimization potential. Scheduling the core operations is formulated as an
optimization problem, requiring feasible traverse operations to be integrated
using a decomposition-based motion planning strategy. Several solution
techniques are explored, including a sampling heuristic, tree-based search and
gradient-free optimization. For motion planning, a decomposition method is
proposed that identifies specific areas in the schedule, which can be solved
independently with modified centralized path planning algorithms. The proposed
method generates efficient and collision-free multi-robot assembly procedures
that outperform a baseline relying on decentralized, robot-individual motion
planning. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through simulation experiments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces GSFusion, a LiDAR-Inertial-Visual mapping system that improves 3D Gaussian Splatting for high-precision, photorealistic mapping by addressing computational and sparse data limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing photorealistic mapping techniques like 3D Gaussian Splatting face challenges such as poor performance in environments with low texture or illumination and significant optimization times when integrating LiDAR data.

Method: GSFusion combines LiDAR, inertial, and visual sensors with innovations like surfel-to-surfel constraints for global pose optimization, pixel-aware Gaussian initialization for sparse data handling, and bounded sigmoid constraints to regulate Gaussian growth.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that GSFusion achieves superior rendering quality and map-building efficiency compared to other 3DGS SLAM systems.

Conclusion: GSFusion successfully addresses the integration challenges of LiDAR with 3DGS, providing a robust and efficient solution for online photorealistic mapping.

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized photorealistic mapping,
conventional approaches based on camera sensor, even RGB-D, suffer from
fundamental limitations such as high computational load, failure in
environments with poor texture or illumination, and short operational ranges.
LiDAR emerges as a robust alternative, but its integration with 3DGS introduces
new challenges, such as the need for exceptional global alignment for
photorealistic quality and prolonged optimization times caused by sparse data.
To address these challenges, we propose GSFusion, an online
LiDAR-Inertial-Visual mapping system that ensures high-precision map
consistency through a surfel-to-surfel constraint in the global pose-graph
optimization. To handle sparse data, our system employs a pixel-aware Gaussian
initialization strategy for efficient representation and a bounded sigmoid
constraint to prevent uncontrolled Gaussian growth. Experiments on public and
our datasets demonstrate our system outperforms existing 3DGS SLAM systems in
terms of rendering quality and map-building efficiency.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a whisker-inspired tactile sensor system and associated control for sub-millimeter accurate object contour detection on complex surfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of lacking active control in tactile robotics for accurate object contour reconstruction, particularly in scenarios requiring precise tip contact.

Method: The authors developed a magnetically-transduced whisker sensor with a robust suspension system, leveraged a gradient descent-based method for tip position detection (with Bayesian filtering for stability), and implemented active control using B-Spline curves for maintaining optimal contact posture.

Result: The proposed approach successfully tracked objects and reconstructed contours with sub-millimeter precision in both simulations and real-world robotic experiments.

Conclusion: The presented system effectively improves tactile sensing and contour reconstruction accuracy, demonstrating its feasibility in robotic object sensing applications.

Abstract: Perception using whisker-inspired tactile sensors currently faces a major
challenge: the lack of active control in robots based on direct contact
information from the whisker. To accurately reconstruct object contours, it is
crucial for the whisker sensor to continuously follow and maintain an
appropriate relative touch pose on the surface. This is especially important
for localization based on tip contact, which has a low tolerance for sharp
surfaces and must avoid slipping into tangential contact. In this paper, we
first construct a magnetically transduced whisker sensor featuring a compact
and robust suspension system composed of three flexible spiral arms. We develop
a method that leverages a characterized whisker deflection profile to directly
extract the tip contact position using gradient descent, with a Bayesian filter
applied to reduce fluctuations. We then propose an active motion control policy
to maintain the optimal relative pose of the whisker sensor against the object
surface. A B-Spline curve is employed to predict the local surface curvature
and determine the sensor orientation. Results demonstrate that our algorithm
can effectively track objects and reconstruct contours with sub-millimeter
accuracy. Finally, we validate the method in simulations and real-world
experiments where a robot arm drives the whisker sensor to follow the surfaces
of three different objects.

*Lucas Elbert Suryana,Saeed Rahmani,Simeon Craig Calvert,Arkady Zgonnikov,Bart van Arem*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel trajectory evaluation framework for Automated Vehicles (AVs) that balances multiple human considerations, including ethical alignment and regulatory compliance, in everyday driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AV systems use rigid rules that struggle to balance competing considerations like legality, comfort, and efficiency in everyday driving, often leading to misaligned human expectations.

Method: A reasons-based trajectory evaluation framework that quantifies human considerations and uses adjustable weights to evaluate AV decision alignment, incorporating a balance function to avoid prioritizing one consideration excessively.

Result: The framework effectively aligns AV trajectories with human reasons by revealing tensions between factors like regulatory compliance, efficiency, and comfort using a real-world-inspired overtaking scenario.

Conclusion: This modular evaluation framework offers a practical and interpretable step toward ensuring ethical and meaningful human control in AV deployment, complementing existing planning systems.

Abstract: A key challenge in deploying automated vehicles (AVs) is ensuring they make
appropriate decisions in ethically challenging everyday driving situations.
While much attention has been paid to rare, high-stakes dilemmas such as
trolley problems, similar tensions also arise in routine scenarios, such as
navigating empty intersections, where multiple human considerations, including
legality and comfort, often conflict. Current AV planning systems typically
rely on rigid rules, which struggle to balance these competing considerations
and can lead to behaviour that misaligns with human expectations. This paper
proposes a novel reasons-based trajectory evaluation framework that
operationalises the tracking condition of Meaningful Human Control (MHC). The
framework models the reasons of human agents, such as regulatory compliance, as
quantifiable functions and evaluates how well candidate AV trajectories align
with these reasons. By assigning adjustable weights to agent priorities and
integrating a balance function to discourage the exclusion of any agent, the
framework supports interpretable decision evaluation. Through a
real-world-inspired overtaking scenario, we show how this approach reveals
tensions, for instance between regulatory compliance, efficiency, and comfort.
The framework functions as a modular evaluation layer over existing planning
algorithms. It offers a transparent tool for assessing ethical alignment in
everyday scenarios and provides a practical step toward implementing MHC in
real-world AV deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drifting control is essential for handling vehicles in emergency situations near friction limits, but reinforcement learning methods face a simulation-to-reality gap.

Method: The authors introduce a framework with GPU-accelerated parallel simulation and systematic domain randomization to train reinforcement learning models for vehicle drifting control.

Result: The approach is successfully validated in both simulations and on a 1/10 scale Individual Wheel Drive RC car platform for achieving controlled drifting in various challenging maneuvers.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers reliable drift control, bridging the simulation-reality gap and achieving precise trajectory tracking in both simulated and real-world contexts.

Abstract: Drifting, characterized by controlled vehicle motion at high sideslip angles,
is crucial for safely handling emergency scenarios at the friction limits.
While recent reinforcement learning approaches show promise for drifting
control, they struggle with the significant simulation-to-reality gap, as
policies that perform well in simulation often fail when transferred to
physical systems. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework
with GPU-accelerated parallel simulation and systematic domain randomization
that effectively bridges the gap. The proposed approach is validated on both
simulation and a custom-designed and open-sourced 1/10 scale Individual Wheel
Drive (IWD) RC car platform featuring independent wheel speed control.
Experiments across various scenarios from steady-state circular drifting to
direction transitions and variable-curvature path following demonstrate that
our approach achieves precise trajectory tracking while maintaining controlled
sideslip angles throughout complex maneuvers in both simulated and real-world
environments.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a navigation framework for autonomous robots in agricultural areas, combining Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem (DTSP) for global path planning and Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) for local planning and control, achieving smoother and shorter paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for autonomous robots in agriculture arises from tasks like weed control, which need efficient navigation while minimizing environmental impact.

Method: The framework combines DTSP to generate optimal curvature-constrained paths and NMPC for precise waypoint control and trajectory adherence.

Result: Compared to decoupled methods, the integrated solution reduces path length by roughly 16% and ensures effective navigation through constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed integrated navigation system offers promising solutions for autonomous robot navigation in complex agricultural environments.

Abstract: There is a growing demand for autonomous mobile robots capable of navigating
unstructured agricultural environments. Tasks such as weed control in meadows
require efficient path planning through an unordered set of coordinates while
minimizing travel distance and adhering to curvature constraints to prevent
soil damage and protect vegetation. This paper presents an integrated
navigation framework combining a global path planner based on the Dubins
Traveling Salesman Problem (DTSP) with a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control
(NMPC) strategy for local path planning and control. The DTSP generates a
minimum-length, curvature-constrained path that efficiently visits all targets,
while the NMPC leverages this path to compute control signals to accurately
reach each waypoint. The system's performance was validated through comparative
simulation analysis on real-world field datasets, demonstrating that the
coupled DTSP-based planner produced smoother and shorter paths, with a
reduction of about 16% in the provided scenario, compared to decoupled methods.
Based thereon, the NMPC controller effectively steered the robot to the desired
waypoints, while locally optimizing the trajectory and ensuring adherence to
constraints. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework
for efficient autonomous navigation in agricultural environments.

TL;DR: This paper introduces physics-guided gain regularization and parameter-conditioning techniques to bridge the simulation-to-reality gap in robot control, yielding better real-world performance compared to domain-randomization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors sought to address the limitations of existing domain randomization methods, which struggle with wide sim-to-real gaps in robot control, especially for robots not suited for traditional low-gear-ratio, backdrivable designs.

Method: They introduced a novel framework with physics-guided gain regularization, experimenting with a robot to measure proportional gains and penalize deviations during training. Controllers were also conditioned on current plant parameters.

Result: On a two-wheeled balancing robot, the proposed controller achieved hardware performance closely matching simulation. In contrast, domain-randomized policies suffered from oscillations and a pronounced sim-to-real gap.

Conclusion: The proposed framework proves to be a lightweight and reproducible method for improving sim-to-real transfer, especially on affordable robotic platforms.

Abstract: Simulation-to-real transfer using domain randomization for robot control
often relies on low-gear-ratio, backdrivable actuators, but these approaches
break down when the sim-to-real gap widens. Inspired by the traditional PID
controller, we reinterpret its gains as surrogates for complex, unmodeled plant
dynamics. We then introduce a physics-guided gain regularization scheme that
measures a robot's effective proportional gains via simple real-world
experiments. Then, we penalize any deviation of a neural controller's local
input-output sensitivities from these values during training. To avoid the
overly conservative bias of naive domain randomization, we also condition the
controller on the current plant parameters. On an off-the-shelf two-wheeled
balancing robot with a 110:1 gearbox, our gain-regularized,
parameter-conditioned RNN achieves angular settling times in hardware that
closely match simulation. At the same time, a purely domain-randomized policy
exhibits persistent oscillations and a substantial sim-to-real gap. These
results demonstrate a lightweight, reproducible framework for closing
sim-to-real gaps on affordable robotic hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scarcity in high-quality robotic demonstration data by using human manipulation data as behavioral priors for robot policy learning.

Method: A two-stage training paradigm: pre-training on egocentric human manipulation videos and fine-tuning on robot-specific data using diffusion transformer architecture and flow matching.

Result: H-RDT significantly outperforms previous models, achieving up to 40.5% improvement in real-world robotic manipulation over training from scratch.

Conclusion: Human manipulation data effectively improves robotic manipulation capabilities, validating its use as a foundation for bimanual robotic policy learning.

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation faces a fundamental challenge:
the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data. Recent
robotic foundation models often pre-train on cross-embodiment robot datasets to
increase data scale, while they face significant limitations as the diverse
morphologies and action spaces across different robot embodiments make unified
training challenging. In this paper, we present H-RDT (Human to Robotics
Diffusion Transformer), a novel approach that leverages human manipulation data
to enhance robot manipulation capabilities. Our key insight is that large-scale
egocentric human manipulation videos with paired 3D hand pose annotations
provide rich behavioral priors that capture natural manipulation strategies and
can benefit robotic policy learning. We introduce a two-stage training
paradigm: (1) pre-training on large-scale egocentric human manipulation data,
and (2) cross-embodiment fine-tuning on robot-specific data with modular action
encoders and decoders. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture with 2B
parameters, H-RDT uses flow matching to model complex action distributions.
Extensive evaluations encompassing both simulation and real-world experiments,
single-task and multitask scenarios, as well as few-shot learning and
robustness assessments, demonstrate that H-RDT outperforms training from
scratch and existing state-of-the-art methods, including Pi0 and RDT, achieving
significant improvements of 13.9% and 40.5% over training from scratch in
simulation and real-world experiments, respectively. The results validate our
core hypothesis that human manipulation data can serve as a powerful foundation
for learning bimanual robotic manipulation policies.

Result: Performance tests demonstrate superior results in trajectory tracking, speed prediction, and adaptive planning in urban environments, particularly in complex settings like construction zones.

Conclusion: The PLA framework shows promise in improving safety, scalability, and interpretation in autonomous driving through tight coupling of perception, language, and decision-making.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in achieving
human-like adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex,
open-world environments. These challenges stem from fragmented architectures,
limited generalization to novel scenarios, and insufficient semantic extraction
from perception. To address these limitations, we propose a unified

(cameras, LiDAR, radar) with a large language model (LLM)-augmented
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture, specifically a GPT-4.1-powered
reasoning core. This framework unifies low-level sensory processing with
high-level contextual reasoning, tightly coupling perception with natural

context-aware, explainable, and safety-bounded autonomous driving. Evaluations
on an urban intersection scenario with a construction zone demonstrate superior
performance in trajectory tracking, speed prediction, and adaptive planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for adaptable social robots requires accurate assessment of user experience, which includes multifaceted measures often overlooked or narrowly addressed in existing methodologies.

Method: The approach utilizes a Transformer-based model to process facial expressions and voice data, leveraging short- and long-term interaction dynamics within a multi-instance learning framework.

Result: Experimental findings reveal that the proposed method surpasses the performance of third-party human evaluators in UX estimation.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of a multimodal, temporal approach to evaluate UX, paving the way for more adaptive and user-centered social robots.

Abstract: In recent years, the demand for social robots has grown, requiring them to
adapt their behaviors based on users' states. Accurately assessing user
experience (UX) in human-robot interaction (HRI) is crucial for achieving this
adaptability. UX is a multi-faceted measure encompassing aspects such as
sentiment and engagement, yet existing methods often focus on these
individually. This study proposes a UX estimation method for HRI by leveraging
multimodal social signals. We construct a UX dataset and develop a
Transformer-based model that utilizes facial expressions and voice for
estimation. Unlike conventional models that rely on momentary observations, our
approach captures both short- and long-term interaction patterns using a
multi-instance learning framework. This enables the model to capture temporal
dynamics in UX, providing a more holistic representation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms third-party human evaluators in UX
estimation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper evaluates current state-of-the-art language models for robotic task planning, comparing their performance to the Fast Downward planner, and identifies challenges in complex planning scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential and limitations of large language models in robotic task planning, specifically in generating executable and reliable plans.

Method: A systematic evaluation was conducted using language models directly prompted with Planning Domain Definition Language files, comparing their planning performance with the Fast Downward planner across various benchmarks.

Result: Language models were capable in simpler planning tasks but struggled with complex scenarios, such as those requiring state tracking, constraint compliance, and resource management.

Conclusion: The study highlights challenges in applying language models to robotic planning, advocating for hybrid approaches combining language models with classical planning techniques for improved reliability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have sparked interest in their
potential for robotic task planning. While these models demonstrate strong
generative capabilities, their effectiveness in producing structured and
executable plans remains uncertain. This paper presents a systematic evaluation
of a broad spectrum of current state of the art language models, each directly
prompted using Planning Domain Definition Language domain and problem files,
and compares their planning performance with the Fast Downward planner across a
variety of benchmarks. In addition to measuring success rates, we assess how
faithfully the generated plans translate into sequences of actions that can
actually be executed, identifying both strengths and limitations of using these
models in this setting. Our findings show that while the models perform well on
simpler planning tasks, they continue to struggle with more complex scenarios
that require precise resource management, consistent state tracking, and strict
constraint compliance. These results underscore fundamental challenges in
applying language models to robotic planning in real world environments. By
outlining the gaps that emerge during execution, we aim to guide future
research toward combined approaches that integrate language models with
classical planners in order to enhance the reliability and scalability of
planning in autonomous robotics.

*Haiyun Zhang,Stefano Dalla Gasperina,Saad N. Yousaf,Toshimitsu Tsuboi,Tetsuya Narita,Ashish D. Deshpande*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a calibration framework to improve hand tracking performance in exoskeletons by addressing challenges stemming from anatomical variability and donning inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate hand tracking in exoskeletons is critical for teleoperation and precision tasks, but current systems struggle with user-specific anatomical differences and misalignments.

Method: The study introduces a subject-specific calibration framework using redundant joint sensing, residual-weighted optimization, and empirically tuned cost function weights for better alignment.

Result: Testing showed a reduction in joint and fingertip tracking errors across seven participants, while qualitative visualization confirmed improved motion fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances tracking accuracy, generalizes across designs, and supports applications like teleoperation and learning-from-demonstration.

Abstract: Hand exoskeletons are critical tools for dexterous teleoperation and
immersive manipulation interfaces, but achieving accurate hand tracking remains
a challenge due to user-specific anatomical variability and donning
inconsistencies. These issues lead to kinematic misalignments that degrade
tracking performance and limit applicability in precision tasks. We propose a
subject-specific calibration framework for exoskeleton-based hand tracking that
uses redundant joint sensing and a residual-weighted optimization strategy to
estimate virtual link parameters. Implemented on the Maestro exoskeleton, our
method improves joint angle and fingertip position estimation across users with
varying hand geometries. We introduce a data-driven approach to empirically
tune cost function weights using motion capture ground truth, enabling more
accurate and consistent calibration across participants. Quantitative results
from seven subjects show substantial reductions in joint and fingertip tracking
errors compared to uncalibrated and evenly weighted models. Qualitative
visualizations using a Unity-based virtual hand further confirm improvements in
motion fidelity. The proposed framework generalizes across exoskeleton designs
with closed-loop kinematics and minimal sensing, and lays the foundation for
high-fidelity teleoperation and learning-from-demonstration applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater robots face challenges in efficient SLAM without prior geometric information, necessitating innovative techniques.

Method: Introduced object graph representation of sonar maps and proposed incremental GCM for improved loop closure detection.

Result: Validated DRACo-SLAM2's performance through comparative analyses on simulated and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DRACo-SLAM2 demonstrates superior time-efficiency and robustness compared to its predecessor.

Abstract: We present DRACo-SLAM2, a distributed SLAM framework for underwater robot
teams equipped with multibeam imaging sonar. This framework improves upon the
original DRACo-SLAM by introducing a novel representation of sonar maps as
object graphs and utilizing object graph matching to achieve time-efficient
inter-robot loop closure detection without relying on prior geometric
information. To better-accommodate the needs and characteristics of underwater
scan matching, we propose incremental Group-wise Consistent Measurement Set
Maximization (GCM), a modification of Pairwise Consistent Measurement Set
Maximization (PCM), which effectively handles scenarios where nearby
inter-robot loop closures share similar registration errors. The proposed
approach is validated through extensive comparative analyses on simulated and
real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges persist in achieving robust, accurate localization in real-world, dynamic settings with long-term environmental changes.

Method: DuLoc tightly integrates LiDAR-inertial odometry and offline maps, using a constant-velocity motion model to reduce noise and adapt to changes.

Result: Real-world experiments over 2,856 hours in ultra unbounded port environments show DuLoc outperforms other state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses challenges in large-scale, dynamic outdoor scenarios, balancing robustness, accuracy, and adaptability.

Abstract: LiDAR-based localization serves as a critical component in autonomous
systems, yet existing approaches face persistent challenges in balancing
repeatability, accuracy, and environmental adaptability. Traditional point
cloud registration methods relying solely on offline maps often exhibit limited
robustness against long-term environmental changes, leading to localization
drift and reliability degradation in dynamic real-world scenarios. To address
these challenges, this paper proposes DuLoc, a robust and accurate localization
method that tightly couples LiDAR-inertial odometry with offline map-based
localization, incorporating a constant-velocity motion model to mitigate
outlier noise in real-world scenarios. Specifically, we develop a LiDAR-based
localization framework that seamlessly integrates a prior global map with
dynamic real-time local maps, enabling robust localization in unbounded and
changing environments. Extensive real-world experiments in ultra unbounded port
that involve 2,856 hours of operational data across 32 Intelligent Guided
Vehicles (IGVs) are conducted and reported in this study. The results attained
demonstrate that our system outperforms other state-of-the-art LiDAR
localization systems in large-scale changing outdoor environments.

Method: It applies pre-trained deep stereo networks for depth estimation and uses a multi-loss strategy to optimize 3D Gaussian representation.

Result: Experiments show BGS-SLAM achieves better tracking and mapping accuracy in outdoor environments compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: BGS-SLAM effectively adapts 3D Gaussian Splatting to outdoor SLAM scenarios, enhancing geometrical and visual representations without active sensors.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained popularity in SLAM
applications due to its fast rendering and high-fidelity representation.
However, existing 3DGS-SLAM systems have predominantly focused on indoor
environments and relied on active depth sensors, leaving a gap for large-scale
outdoor applications. We present BGS-SLAM, the first binocular 3D Gaussian
Splatting SLAM system designed for outdoor scenarios. Our approach uses only
RGB stereo pairs without requiring LiDAR or active sensors. BGS-SLAM leverages
depth estimates from pre-trained deep stereo networks to guide 3D Gaussian
optimization with a multi-loss strategy enhancing both geometric consistency
and visual quality. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that BGS-SLAM
achieves superior tracking accuracy and mapping performance compared to other
3DGS-based solutions in complex outdoor environments.

Result: Villa-X demonstrates superior performance over other models in both simulated environments (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and real-world robot setups involving gripper and dexterous hand manipulation.

Conclusion: Villa-X establishes a strong foundation in latent action modeling for robot manipulation, showing significant promise for future advancements in this area.

Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a popular paradigm for
learning robot manipulation policies that can follow language instructions and
generalize to novel scenarios. Recent work has begun to explore the
incorporation of latent actions, an abstract representation of visual change
between two frames, into VLA pre-training. In this paper, we introduce villa-X,
a novel Visual-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework that advances latent
action modeling for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. Our
approach improves both how latent actions are learned and how they are
incorporated into VLA pre-training. Together, these contributions enable
villa-X to achieve superior performance across simulated environments including
SIMPLER and LIBERO, as well as on two real-world robot setups including gripper
and dexterous hand manipulation. We believe the ViLLA paradigm holds
significant promise, and that our villa-X provides a strong foundation for

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that reinforcement learning can enable visuomotor agents in Minecraft to achieve zero-shot generalization to unseen environments through automated multi-task training and spatial reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of generalization in visuomotor agents, specifically their tendency to overfit tasks/environments, by exploring methods for achieving broad applicability in spatial reasoning and interactions.

Method: The authors propose cross-view goal specification for unified multi-task RL representation, automated task synthesis within Minecraft, and an efficient distributed RL framework to advance multi-task RL training.

Result: The RL methodology increases interaction success rates by 4× and achieves zero-shot generalization of spatial reasoning across diverse environments, including real-world settings.

Conclusion: RL in customizable 3D environments like Minecraft holds significant promise for advancing visuomotor agents’ spatial reasoning capabilities and generalization potential.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in language
modeling, its triumph hasn't yet fully translated to visuomotor agents. A
primary challenge in RL models is their tendency to overfit specific tasks or
environments, thereby hindering the acquisition of generalizable behaviors
across diverse settings. This paper provides a preliminary answer to this
challenge by demonstrating that RL-finetuned visuomotor agents in Minecraft can
achieve zero-shot generalization to unseen worlds. Specifically, we explore
RL's potential to enhance generalizable spatial reasoning and interaction
capabilities in 3D worlds. To address challenges in multi-task RL
representation, we analyze and establish cross-view goal specification as a
unified multi-task goal space for visuomotor policies. Furthermore, to overcome
the significant bottleneck of manual task design, we propose automated task
synthesis within the highly customizable Minecraft environment for large-scale
multi-task RL training, and we construct an efficient distributed RL framework
to support this. Experimental results show RL significantly boosts interaction
success rates by $4\times$ and enables zero-shot generalization of spatial
reasoning across diverse environments, including real-world settings. Our
findings underscore the immense potential of RL training in 3D simulated
environments, especially those amenable to large-scale task generation, for
significantly advancing visuomotor agents' spatial reasoning.

*Parker McDonnell,Lingsheng Meng,Hari Krishna Hariprasad,Alexander Hedrick,Eduardo Miscles,Samuel Gilinsky,Jean-Michel Mongeau,Kaushik Jayaram*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Researchers developed CITRAS, a bioinspired tactile robotic antenna sensor, capable of robust, precise environmental sensing for insect-scale robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replicate the tactile sensing capabilities of natural systems like the American cockroach for autonomous perception and navigation in insect-scale robots, overcoming the limitations of size, weight, and power in existing sensor technologies.

Method: CITRAS is designed as a bioinspired, multi-segmented compliant laminate sensor with embedded capacitive angle sensors. It is compact, lightweight, and low-power, capable of passively bending and accurately measuring hinge angles in both quasistatic and dynamic conditions. Experimental evaluations validate its multifunctional tactile perception capabilities.

Result: CITRAS achieved high precision in hinge angle measurements with maximum errors of 0.79° (quasistatic) and 3.58° (dynamic), base-to-tip distance prediction with 7.75% error, gap width estimation with 6.73% error, and surface texture differentiation using differential sensor responses.

Conclusion: CITRAS offers a significant advancement in tactile sensing for insect-scale robots, paving the way for improved exploration, obstacle avoidance, and environmental mapping in confined and complex environments.

Abstract: The American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) uses its soft antennae to
guide decision making by extracting rich tactile information from tens of
thousands of distributed mechanosensors. Although tactile sensors enable
robust, autonomous perception and navigation in natural systems, replicating
these capabilities in insect-scale robots remains challenging due to stringent
size, weight, and power constraints that limit existing sensor technologies. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CITRAS (Cockroach Inspired Tactile
Robotic Antenna Sensor), a bioinspired, multi-segmented, compliant laminate
sensor with embedded capacitive angle sensors. CITRAS is compact (73.7x15.6x2.1
mm), lightweight (491 mg), and low-power (32 mW), enabling seamless integration
with miniature robotic platforms. The segmented compliant structure passively
bends in response to environmental stimuli, achieving accurate hinge angle
measurements with maximum errors of just 0.79 degree (quasistatic bending) and
3.58 degree (dynamic bending). Experimental evaluations demonstrate CITRAS'
multifunctional tactile perception capabilities: predicting base-to-tip
distances with 7.75 % error, estimating environmental gap widths with 6.73 %
error, and distinguishing surface textures through differential sensor
response. The future integration of this bioinspired tactile antenna in
insect-scale robots addresses critical sensing gaps, promising enhanced
autonomous exploration, obstacle avoidance, and environmental mapping in
complex, confined environments.

*Fabian Stiehle,Hans Weytjens,Ingo Weber*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates using large language models (LLMs) to generate smart contract code from business process descriptions and introduces a benchmarking framework to evaluate such capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to overcome the limitations of traditional rule-based code generation approaches and address shortcomings in how LLM-generated code is currently evaluated, such as small sample sizes and incomplete testing criteria.

Method: They conducted an exploratory study using LLMs of different types and sizes on larger datasets of process models, developing an automated evaluation framework to systematically evaluate generated code's capabilities in enforcing execution properties.

Result: The study found that LLMs fall short of the reliability required for smart contract development, particularly in ensuring correct execution properties like process flow, resource allocation, and data-based conditions.

Conclusion: The results underscore the need for integrating LLMs responsibly into existing code generation tools to improve their reliability. The introduced benchmarking framework can facilitate the development and evaluation of such integrations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have changed the reality of how software is
produced. Within the wider software engineering community, among many other
purposes, they are explored for code generation use cases from different types
of input. In this work, we present an exploratory study to investigate the use
of LLMs for generating smart contract code from business process descriptions,
an idea that has emerged in recent literature to overcome the limitations of
traditional rule-based code generation approaches. However, current LLM-based
work evaluates generated code on small samples, relying on manual inspection,
or testing whether code compiles but ignoring correct execution. With this
work, we introduce an automated evaluation framework and provide empirical data
from larger data sets of process models. We test LLMs of different types and
sizes in their capabilities of achieving important properties of process
execution, including enforcing process flow, resource allocation, and
data-based conditions. Our results show that LLM performance falls short of the
perfect reliability required for smart contract development. We suggest future
work to explore responsible LLM integrations in existing tools for code
generation to ensure more reliable output. Our benchmarking framework can serve
as a foundation for developing and evaluating such integrations.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FlowETL proposes an autonomous ETL pipeline architecture aimed at automating the ETL process with minimal human intervention, showing promising generalization across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the heavy human involvement in modern ETL processes, particularly for context-specific transformations that are time-consuming and lack generalizability.

Method: The authors introduce FlowETL, an autonomous ETL system. It utilizes a Planning Engine to construct transformation plans based on paired input-output datasets, while ETL workers execute these transformations. Monitoring and logging ensure observability and reliability in the pipeline.

Result: FlowETL demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across 14 diverse datasets, differing in domain, structure, and size, indicating its effectiveness in automating transformations.

Conclusion: FlowETL reduces human-in-the-loop requirements for ETL processes and offers a promising approach to automating data preparation and standardization while maintaining adaptability across various datasets.

Abstract: The Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) workflow is fundamental for populating and
maintaining data warehouses and other data stores accessed by analysts for
downstream tasks. A major shortcoming of modern ETL solutions is the extensive
need for a human-in-the-loop, required to design and implement
context-specific, and often non-generalisable transformations. While related
work in the field of ETL automation shows promising progress, there is a lack
of solutions capable of automatically designing and applying these
transformations. We present FlowETL, a novel example-based autonomous ETL
pipeline architecture designed to automatically standardise and prepare input
datasets according to a concise, user-defined target dataset. FlowETL is an
ecosystem of components which interact together to achieve the desired outcome.
A Planning Engine uses a paired input-output datasets sample to construct a
transformation plan, which is then applied by an ETL worker to the source
dataset. Monitoring and logging provide observability throughout the entire
pipeline. The results show promising generalisation capabilities across 14
datasets of various domains, file structures, and file sizes.

the growing popularity of vibe coding approaches that rely on Large Language
Models (LLMs) to transform natural language descriptions into running code at
the expenses of code vulnerabilities, scalability issues and maintainability
concerns. In this paper, we introduce the concept of \textit{vibe modeling} as

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes AutoBridge, a system for automating IoT device integration code generation using a systematic debugging pipeline and achieving high success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Programming IoT integration code is complex and requires significant expertise, making IoT integration challenging.

Method: The authors present AutoBridge, a divide-and-conquer approach for IoT code generation. It incorporates device-specific and platform-specific knowledge, complemented by a multi-stage debugging pipeline with automated and user-feedback tools.

Result: AutoBridge achieves 93.87% success rates in automated code generation, reaching 100% function coverage with minimal user feedback. User studies further reveal it outperforms expert programmers in accuracy by 50-80%.

Conclusion: AutoBridge significantly reduces human effort, enhances programming accuracy, and automates IoT integration tasks effectively.

Abstract: Multimodal IoT systems coordinate diverse IoT devices to deliver
human-centered services. The ability to incorporate new IoT devices under the
management of a centralized platform is an essential requirement. However, it
requires significant human expertise and effort to program the complex IoT
integration code that enables the platform to understand and control the device
functions. Therefore, we propose AutoBridge to automate IoT integration code
generation. Specifically, AutoBridge adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy: it
first generates device control logic by progressively retrieving
device-specific knowledge, then synthesizes platformcompliant integration code
using platform-specific knowledge. To ensure correctness, AutoBridge features a
multi-stage debugging pipeline, including an automated debugger for virtual IoT
device testing and an interactive hardware-in-the-loop debugger that requires
only binary user feedback (yes and no) for real-device verification. We
evaluate AutoBridge on a benchmark of 34 IoT devices across two open-source IoT
platforms. The results demonstrate that AutoBridge can achieves an average
success rate of 93.87% and an average function coverage of 94.87%, without any
human involvement. With minimal binary yes and no feedback from users, the code
is then revised to reach 100% function coverage. A user study with 15
participants further shows that AutoBridge outperforms expert programmers by
50% to 80% in code accuracy, even when the programmers are allowed to use
commercial code LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous business processes (ABPs) enhance efficiency but raise trust, accountability, and compliance issues.

Method: The paper proposes eXplainable ABPs (XABPs) that can articulate decision rationales, offering a structured approach to explainability.

Result: Detailed characterization of XABPs' forms, systematic approach to structuring explainability, and identifying challenges in business process management (BPM).

Conclusion: Integrating explainability into ABPs is vital for addressing trust, regulatory, and usability concerns, paving the way for more reliable AI-driven workflows.

Abstract: Autonomous business processes (ABPs), i.e., self-executing workflows
leveraging AI/ML, have the potential to improve operational efficiency, reduce
errors, lower costs, improve response times, and free human workers for more
strategic and creative work. However, ABPs may raise specific concerns
including decreased stakeholder trust, difficulties in debugging, hindered
accountability, risk of bias, and issues with regulatory compliance. We argue
for eXplainable ABPs (XABPs) to address these concerns by enabling systems to
articulate their rationale. The paper outlines a systematic approach to XABPs,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing agent-based approaches for issue resolution often fail at identifying issue patterns spanning across different parts of the codebase, leading to suboptimal solutions.

Method: The method involves creating fault propagation traces using a code dependency graph, followed by a structured, three-round debate among specialized reasoning agents, and concludes with an MCTS-based agent for patch generation.

Result: SWE-Debate exhibits state-of-the-art performance on the SWE-bench benchmark, surpassing existing open-source frameworks and baselines.

Conclusion: The competitive, multi-agent debate framework SWE-Debate demonstrates its capability to enhance issue localization and resolution, making significant strides over existing tools.

Abstract: Issue resolution has made remarkable progress thanks to the advanced
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recently, agent-based
frameworks such as SWE-agent have further advanced this progress by enabling
autonomous, tool-using agents to tackle complex software engineering tasks.
While existing agent-based issue resolution approaches are primarily based on
agents' independent explorations, they often get stuck in local solutions and
fail to identify issue patterns that span across different parts of the
codebase. To address this limitation, we propose SWE-Debate, a competitive
multi-agent debate framework that encourages diverse reasoning paths and
achieves more consolidated issue localization. SWE-Debate first creates
multiple fault propagation traces as localization proposals by traversing a
code dependency graph. Then, it organizes a three-round debate among
specialized agents, each embodying distinct reasoning perspectives along the
fault propagation trace. This structured competition enables agents to
collaboratively converge on a consolidated fix plan. Finally, this consolidated
fix plan is integrated into an MCTS-based code modification agent for patch
generation. Experiments on the SWE-bench benchmark show that SWE-Debate
achieves new state-of-the-art results in open-source agent frameworks and
outperforms baselines by a large margin.

### [293] [SWE-Exp: Experience-Driven Software Issue Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23361)
*Silin Chen,Shaoxin Lin,Xiaodong Gu,Yuling Shi,Heng Lian,Longfei Yun,Dong Chen,Weiguo Sun,Lin Cao,Qianxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes SWE-Exp, an experience-enhanced approach for software issue resolution, which utilizes previous repair experiences to improve performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language model agents for issue resolution do not reuse knowledge from past experiences, resulting in redundant and inefficient exploration.

Method: The authors introduce SWE-Exp, which creates a multi-faceted experience bank to capture knowledge from both successful and failed repair attempts, enabling continuous learning at various abstraction levels.

Result: SWE-Exp outperforms existing approaches with a state-of-the-art resolution rate of 41.6% Pass@1 on a verified benchmark.

Conclusion: SWE-Exp showcases a shift to experience-driven issue resolution, emphasizing systematic knowledge accumulation and reuse to enhance software engineering agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable
progress in software issue resolution, leveraging advanced techniques such as
multi-agent collaboration and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, current
agents act as memoryless explorers - treating each problem separately without
retaining or reusing knowledge from previous repair experiences. This leads to
redundant exploration of failed trajectories and missed chances to adapt
successful issue resolution methods to similar problems. To address this
problem, we introduce SWE-Exp, an experience - enhanced approach that distills
concise and actionable experience from prior agent trajectories, enabling
continuous learning across issues. Our method introduces a multi-faceted
experience bank that captures both successful and failed repair attempts.
Specifically, it extracts reusable issue resolution knowledge at different
levels - from high-level problem comprehension to specific code changes.
Experiments show that SWE-Exp achieves state-of-the-art resolution rate (41.6%
Pass@1) on SWE-bench-Verified under open-source agent frameworks. Our approach
establishes a new paradigm in which automated software engineering agents
systematically accumulate and leverage repair expertise, fundamentally shifting
from trial-and-error exploration to strategic, experience-driven issue
resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing LLM-based ensemble methods, particularly in managing large ensemble spaces and achieving repository-level understanding for software issue resolution.

Method: Introduced Trae Agent, which uses modular agents for generation, pruning, and selection to address ensemble reasoning challenges in LLMs.

Conclusion: Trae Agent demonstrates superior capabilities in software issue resolution, showcasing its effectiveness through significant experimental results and offering open-source tools for community use.

Abstract: Software issue resolution is a critical challenge in software engineering and
has garnered increasing attention in recent years. With the rapid advancement
of large language models (LLMs), substantial progress has been made in
addressing real-world software engineering tasks. Recent studies have
introduced ensemble reasoning techniques to enhance the performance of
LLM-based issue resolution. However, existing prompting-based methods still
face limitations in effectively exploring large ensemble spaces and lack the
capacity for repository-level understanding, both of which constrain their
overall effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Trae Agent, the first
agent-based ensemble reasoning approach for repository-level issue resolution.
Trae Agent formulates our goal as an optimal solution search problem and
addresses two key challenges, i.e., large ensemble spaces and repository-level
understanding, through modular agents for generation, pruning, and selection.
We conduct extensive experiments using three leading LLMs on the widely-adopted
SWE-bench benchmark, comparing Trae Agent against four state-of-the-art
ensemble reasoning techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that Trae Agent
consistently achieves superior performance, with an average improvement of
10.22% over all baselines in terms of Pass@1. Trae Agent has achieved first
place on the SWE-bench Verified leaderboard, with a notable Pass@1 score of
75.20%. We are pleased to release Trae Agent as an open-source project to
support the research community, with all resources available at

### [296] [An Empirical Study on the Amount of Changes Required for Merge Request Acceptance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23640)
*Samah Kansab,Mohammed Sayagh,Francis Bordeleau,Ali Tizghadam*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study examines code review (CR) effort in GitLab Merge Requests (MRs), focusing on the volume of post-submission code adjustments. Using a dataset of over 23,600 MRs, researchers model CR effort with machine learning, achieving strong prediction performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code review is crucial for ensuring proper integration of new code, but it often demands significant post-submission effort. Understanding factors that influence this effort can improve the process.

Method: Researchers analyzed CR effort in over 23,600 GitLab Merge Requests, identifying key predictors using an interpretable machine learning model. Metrics included code complexity, developer experience, text features, and historical project data.

Result: The study found that 71% of MRs required adjustments, with 28% involving over 200 lines of modifications. The developed model accurately predicts CR effort (AUC 0.84-0.88), highlighting complexity and experience as critical variables.

Conclusion: Machine learning can effectively predict and explain CR effort, providing insights to streamline code integration during reviews and uncovering key influencing factors like code complexity and developer experience.

Abstract: Code review (CR) is essential to software development, helping ensure that
new code is properly integrated. However, the CR process often involves
significant effort, including code adjustments, responses to reviewers, and
continued implementation. While past studies have examined CR delays and
iteration counts, few have investigated the effort based on the volume of code
changes required, especially in the context of GitLab Merge Requests (MRs),
which remains underexplored. In this paper, we define and measure CR effort as
the amount of code modified after submission, using a dataset of over 23,600
MRs from four GitLab projects. We find that up to 71% of MRs require
adjustments after submission, and 28% of these involve changes to more than 200
lines of code. Surprisingly, this effort is not correlated with review time or
the number of participants. To better understand and predict CR effort, we
train an interpretable machine learning model using metrics across multiple
dimensions: text features, code complexity, developer experience, review
history, and branching. Our model achieves strong performance (AUC 0.84-0.88)
and reveals that complexity, experience, and text features are key predictors.
Historical project characteristics also influence current review effort. Our
findings highlight the feasibility of using machine learning to explain and
anticipate the effort needed to integrate code changes during review.

*John J. Briguglio,Jaesung Lee,Albert K. Lee,Vincent Hakim,Sandro Romani*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper examines why power-law scaling appears in coarse-grained neural activity data, demonstrating that it can arise without true critical dynamics due to the clustering method itself.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether power-law scaling in neural activity data truly arises from critical dynamics or if it can emerge from other factors, such as methodological effects.

Method: The researchers apply a phenomenological renormalization group (PRG) procedure to neural activity data, also simulating heterogeneous, non-interacting units with spatially structured activity to compare outcomes.

Result: Power-law scaling emerges in neural activity data even without critical interactions, and scaling exponents for non-interacting units match values observed in experimental data.

Conclusion: The clustering procedure used in analysis, rather than inherent critical dynamics in the system, may explain power-law scaling in neural data, and system characteristics influence scaling outcomes.

Abstract: Power-law scaling in coarse-grained data suggests critical dynamics, but the
true source of this scaling often remains unclear. Here, we analyze neural
activity recorded during spatial navigation, reproducing power-law scaling
under a phenomenological renormalization group (PRG) procedure that clusters
units by activity similarity. Such scaling was previously linked to
criticality. Here, we show that the iterative nature of the procedure itself
leads to the emergence of power laws when applied to heterogeneous,
non-interacting units obeying spatially structured activity without requiring
critical interactions. Furthermore, the scaling exponents produced by
heteregeneous non-interacting units match the observed exponents in recorded
neural data. A simplified version of the PRG further reveals how heterogeneity
smooths transitions across scales, mimicking critical behavior. The resulting
exponents depend systematically on system and population size, predictions
confirmed by subsampling the data.

### [298] [Alpha-Z divergence unveils further distinct phenotypic traits of human brain connectivity fingerprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23116)
*Md Kaosar Uddin,Nghi Nguyen,Huajun Huang,Duy Duong-Tran,Jingyi Zheng*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new Alpha-Z Bures-Wasserstein divergence metric for comparing functional connectomes (FCs), improving identification performance and generalizability across conditions and spatial scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the identification of individuals from functional connectomes by addressing limitations of traditional metrics (e.g., Pearson's correlation) and enhancing geometry-awareness in data comparison methods.

Method: The authors propose the Alpha-Z Bures-Wasserstein divergence as a flexible, geometry-aware distance metric. It is tested against traditional metrics (e.g., Pearson) and advanced metrics (e.g., log-Euclidean, Bures-Wasserstein) on the Human Connectome Project dataset across various conditions.

Result: The proposed method outperforms traditional and advanced geodesic distances in identification rates, remains robust across task types and spatial scales, and mitigates performance degradation due to matrix rank deficiencies in high-dimensional data.

Conclusion: The Alpha-Z Bures-Wasserstein divergence is a robust, geometry-aware metric that enhances identification accuracy and generalizability in functional connectivity analysis, aiding neuropsychiatric research and linking FC patterns to cognitive outcomes.

Abstract: The accurate identification of individuals from functional connectomes (FCs)
is critical for advancing individualized assessments in neuropsychiatric
research. Traditional methods, such as Pearson's correlation, have limitations
in capturing the complex, non-Euclidean geometry of FC data, leading to
suboptimal performance in identification performance. Recent developments have
introduced geodesic distance as a more robust metric; however, its performance
is highly sensitive to regularization choices, which vary by spatial scale and
task condition. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
divergence-based distance metric, the Alpha-Z Bures-Wasserstein divergence,
which provides a more flexible and geometry-aware framework for FC comparison.
Unlike prior methods, our approach does not require meticulous parameter tuning
and maintains strong identification performance across multiple task conditions
and spatial resolutions. We evaluate our approach against both traditional
(e.g., Euclidean, Pearson) and state-of-the-art manifold-based distances (e.g.,
affine-invariant, log-Euclidean, Bures-Wasserstein), and systematically
investigate how varying regularization strengths affect geodesic distance
performance on the Human Connectome Project dataset. Our results show that the
proposed method significantly improves identification rates over traditional
and geodesic distances, particularly when optimized regularization is applied,
and especially in high-dimensional settings where matrix rank deficiencies
degrade existing metrics. We further validate its generalizability across
resting-state and task-based fMRI, using multiple parcellation schemes. These
findings suggest that the new divergence provides a more reliable and
generalizable framework for functional connectivity analysis, offering enhanced
sensitivity in linking FC patterns to cognitive and behavioral outcomes.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper explores how complex network representations can elucidate brain pathologies, disease vulnerability, and recovery potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine if the brain's network structure influences not only its functions but also pathologies and recovery from diseases.

Method: The study discusses the relationship between disease definitions, functional definitions, and network properties to identify relevant network aspects in brain diseases.

Result: The findings suggest that addressing brain disease through a network lens can provide insights into pathology, functionality, and potential clinical applications.

Conclusion: Understanding the 'networkness' of brain diseases can enhance our knowledge of brain pathology and functional activities, aiding in clinical advancements.

Abstract: If brain anatomy and dynamics have a genuine complex network structure as it
has become standard to posit, it is also reasonable to assume that such a
structure should play a key role not only in brain function but also in brain
dysfunction. However, exactly how network structure is implicated in brain
damage and whether at least some pathologies can be thought of as "network
diseases" is not entirely clear. Here we discuss ways in which a complex
network representation can help characterising brain pathology, but also
subjects' vulnerability to and likelihood of recovery from disease. We show how
the way disease is defined is related to the way function is defined and this,
in turn, determines which network property may be functionally relevant to
brain disease. Thus, addressing brain disease "networkness" may shed light not
only on brain pathology, with potential clinical implications, but also on
functional brain activity, and what is functional in it.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a stable and rigorously superlinear convergent algorithm for phase retrieval using a smoothing framework to address limitations in the Bures-Wasserstein gradient descent method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instabilities and limited theoretical convergence guarantees of Bures-Wasserstein gradient descent in phase retrieval problems.

Method: The paper introduces a smoothing framework that regularizes the nonsmooth and nonconvex objective used in the BWGD algorithm.

Result: The smoothed algorithm achieves improved stability and retains superlinear convergence in solving phase retrieval problems, as validated through experiments on synthetic data.

Conclusion: The refined approach bridges the gap between practical performance and theoretical guarantees, ensuring stable and fast convergence for rank-one matrix recovery.

Abstract: We consider the phase retrieval problem, which involves recovering a rank-one
positive semidefinite matrix from rank-one measurements. A recently proposed
algorithm based on Bures-Wasserstein gradient descent (BWGD) exhibits
superlinear convergence, but it is unstable, and existing theory can only prove
local linear convergence for higher rank matrix recovery. We resolve this gap
by revealing that BWGD implements Newton's method with a nonsmooth and
nonconvex objective. We develop a smoothing framework that regularizes the
objective, enabling a stable method with rigorous superlinear convergence
guarantees. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate this superior stability
while maintaining fast convergence.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses fairness issues in individualized treatment rules influenced by sensitive attributes, introducing an approach based on optimal transport theory to enhance fairness while balancing trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensitive attributes like race, gender, or age can lead to unfair outcomes in ITRs, necessitating methods to ensure fairness in applications like precision medicine and advertising recommendations.

Method: An optimal transport-based approach that converts ITRs into fair ones ensuring demographic parity, complemented by an "improved trade-off ITR" for balancing fairness and value optimization via adjustable parameters and smoothed constraints.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates theoretical bounds on value loss and is validated through simulations and real-world applications, such as the Next 36 entrepreneurial program dataset.

Conclusion: The approach enables fairness in decision-making systems with minimal loss in value, providing practical flexibility for different fairness levels.

Abstract: Individualized treatment rules (ITRs) have gained significant attention due
to their wide-ranging applications in fields such as precision medicine,
ridesharing, and advertising recommendations. However, when ITRs are influenced
by sensitive attributes such as race, gender, or age, they can lead to outcomes
where certain groups are unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged. To address this
gap, we propose a flexible approach based on the optimal transport theory,
which is capable of transforming any optimal ITR into a fair ITR that ensures
demographic parity. Recognizing the potential loss of value under fairness
constraints, we introduce an ``improved trade-off ITR," designed to balance
value optimization and fairness while accommodating varying levels of fairness
through parameter adjustment. To maximize the value of the improved trade-off
ITR under specific fairness levels, we propose a smoothed fairness constraint
for estimating the adjustable parameter. Additionally, we establish a
theoretical upper bound on the value loss for the improved trade-off ITR. We
demonstrate performance of the proposed method through extensive simulation
studies and application to the Next 36 entrepreneurial program dataset.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid framework for removing sensitive information from medical imaging data to enable secure sharing for research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The presence of Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in medical imaging data creates ethical and security concerns, blocking data sharing opportunities for healthcare research.

Method: The method integrates rule-based techniques, AI-driven models, and uncertainty quantification to de-identify metadata and pixel data in medical imaging files effectively.

Result: The framework achieves compliance with benchmarks and regulatory standards like DICOM, HIPAA, and TCIA, demonstrating strong performance in de-identifying medical images.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid approach promotes secure and ethical sharing of medical imaging data for research by combining scalability, reliability, and comprehensive quality assurance measures.

Abstract: Access to medical imaging and associated text data has the potential to drive
major advances in healthcare research and patient outcomes. However, the
presence of Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable
Information (PII) in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)
files presents a significant barrier to the ethical and secure sharing of
imaging datasets. This paper presents a hybrid de-identification framework
developed by Impact Business Information Solutions (IBIS) that combines
rule-based and AI-driven techniques, and rigorous uncertainty quantification
for comprehensive PHI/PII removal from both metadata and pixel data.
  Our approach begins with a two-tiered rule-based system targeting explicit
and inferred metadata elements, further augmented by a large language model
(LLM) fine-tuned for Named Entity Recognition (NER), and trained on a suite of
synthetic datasets simulating realistic clinical PHI/PII. For pixel data, we
employ an uncertainty-aware Faster R-CNN model to localize embedded text,
extract candidate PHI via Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and apply the
NER pipeline for final redaction. Crucially, uncertainty quantification
provides confidence measures for AI-based detections to enhance automation
reliability and enable informed human-in-the-loop verification to manage
residual risks.
  This uncertainty-aware deidentification framework achieves robust performance
across benchmark datasets and regulatory standards, including DICOM, HIPAA, and
TCIA compliance metrics. By combining scalable automation, uncertainty
quantification, and rigorous quality assurance, our solution addresses critical
challenges in medical data de-identification and supports the secure, ethical,
and trustworthy release of imaging data for research.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for identifying unique pricing patterns in secondary ticket resale markets using dynamic Beta distribution modeling and enhanced Random Forest classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The secondary ticket resale market is opaque, with a challenge in understanding dynamic pricing distributions and economic signatures of performing acts. This paper aims to fill this gap using statistical modeling and machine learning.

Method: The authors use a curated time-series dataset, model pricing distributions as scaled Beta distributions, and employ quantile matching and the method of moments for parameter estimation. They further integrate these parameters into Random Forest classifiers for improved classification.

Result: The approach significantly enhances pairwise artist classification accuracy and demonstrates unique economic signatures in event pricing data. Additionally, incorporating zero-variance features into Random Forest models acts as an implicit regularizer.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of using advanced statistical modeling and machine learning methods to uncover unique signatures in economic data while providing insights into model regularization techniques for improving robustness and mitigating overfitting.

Abstract: A novel approach is presented for identifying distinct signatures of
performing acts in the secondary ticket resale market by analyzing dynamic
pricing distributions. Using a newly curated, time series dataset from the
SeatGeek API, we model ticket pricing distributions as scaled Beta
distributions. This enables accurate parameter estimation from incomplete
statistical data using a hybrid of quantile matching and the method of moments.
Incorporating the estimated $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters into Random Forest
classifiers significantly improves pairwise artist classification accuracy,
demonstrating the unique economic signatures in event pricing data.
Additionally, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that incorporating
zero-variance (constant-value) features into Random Forest models acts as an
implicit regularizer, enhancing feature variety and robustness. This
regularization promotes deeper, more varied trees in the ensemble, improving
the bias-variance tradeoff and mitigating overfitting to dominant features.
These findings are validated on both the new ticket pricing dataset and the
standard UCI ML handwritten digits dataset.

### [304] [Formal Bayesian Transfer Learning via the Total Risk Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23768)
*Nathan Wycoff,Ali Arab,Lisa O. Singh*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel Bayesian approach for transfer learning with limited source and target datasets, showing improved performance over frequentist methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of effectively utilizing ancillary source datasets to augment target datasets in statistically limited scenarios, particularly when source datasets are themselves limited and poorly aligned with the target.

Method: It introduces a Bayesian-centric approach that constructs a single joint prior distribution for parameters of both source and target datasets using a risk minimizer conditional on source parameters, allowing Bayesian uncertainty quantification and model averaging through Gibbs sampling.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior predictive performance, particularly in scenarios with limited source data, as shown by applications in genetics, outperforming frequentist transfer learning methods.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of the proposed Bayesian framework for transfer learning, offering robust uncertainty quantification and superior predictive accuracy, even under challenging data limitations.

Abstract: In analyses with severe data-limitations, augmenting the target dataset with
information from ancillary datasets in the application domain, called source
datasets, can lead to significantly improved statistical procedures. However,
existing methods for this transfer learning struggle to deal with situations
where the source datasets are also limited and not guaranteed to be
well-aligned with the target dataset. A typical strategy is to use the
empirical loss minimizer on the source data as a prior mean for the target
parameters, which places the estimation of source parameters outside of the
Bayesian formalism. Our key conceptual contribution is to use a risk minimizer
conditional on source parameters instead. This allows us to construct a single
joint prior distribution for all parameters from the source datasets as well as
the target dataset. As a consequence, we benefit from full Bayesian uncertainty
quantification and can perform model averaging via Gibbs sampling over
indicator variables governing the inclusion of each source dataset. We show how
a particular instantiation of our prior leads to a Bayesian Lasso in a
transformed coordinate system and discuss computational techniques to scale our
approach to moderately sized datasets. We also demonstrate that recently
proposed minimax-frequentist transfer learning techniques may be viewed as an
approximate Maximum a Posteriori approach to our model. Finally, we demonstrate
superior predictive performance relative to the frequentist baseline on a
genetics application, especially when the source data are limited.

### [305] [On the Complexity of Finding Stationary Points in Nonconvex Simple Bilevel Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23155)
*Jincheng Cao,Ruichen Jiang,Erfan Yazdandoost Hamedani,Aryan Mokhtari*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper explores the problem of solving nonconvex bilevel optimization and presents a dynamic barrier gradient descent (DBGD) framework to achieve stationarity for both levels. It establishes the first complexity guarantee for such algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the challenging problem of bilevel optimization where both objectives are smooth but nonconvex, and traditional structural assumptions like convexity or PL conditions don't apply.

Method: A modified dynamic barrier gradient descent (DBGD) framework is introduced to find stationary solutions efficiently, with polynomial complexity for the upper- and lower-level objectives.

Result: The algorithm achieves $(
abla_f, 
abla_g)$-stationarity with a complexity of $O(	ext{max}(
abla_f^{-(3+p)/(1+p)}, 
abla_g^{-(3+p)/2}))$, offering the first proven complexity result for discrete-time solutions to joint stationarity in nonconvex bilevel problems.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the absence of convex/PL assumptions in bilevel optimization by proposing a scalable algorithm with guaranteed stationarity for both levels, filling an important gap in the optimization literature.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of solving a simple bilevel optimization
problem, where the upper-level objective is minimized over the solution set of
the lower-level problem. We focus on the general setting in which both the
upper- and lower-level objectives are smooth but potentially nonconvex. Due to
the absence of additional structural assumptions for the lower-level
objective-such as convexity or the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL)
condition-guaranteeing global optimality is generally intractable. Instead, we
introduce a suitable notion of stationarity for this class of problems and aim
to design a first-order algorithm that finds such stationary points in
polynomial time. Intuitively, stationarity in this setting means the
upper-level objective cannot be substantially improved locally without causing
a larger deterioration in the lower-level objective. To this end, we show that
a simple and implementable variant of the dynamic barrier gradient descent
(DBGD) framework can effectively solve the considered nonconvex simple bilevel
problems up to stationarity. Specifically, to reach an $(\epsilon_f,
\epsilon_g)$-stationary point-where $\epsilon_f$ and $\epsilon_g$ denote the
target stationarity accuracies for the upper- and lower-level objectives,
respectively-the considered method achieves a complexity of
$\mathcal{O}\left(\max\left(\epsilon_f^{-\frac{3+p}{1+p}},
\epsilon_g^{-\frac{3+p}{2}}\right)\right)$, where $p \geq 0$ is an arbitrary
constant balancing the terms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
complexity result for a discrete-time algorithm that guarantees joint
stationarity for both levels in general nonconvex simple bilevel problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLMs can be seamlessly integrated into multi-agent systems, particularly in geosimulation platforms, for more effective modeling and simulation.

Method: The study formalizes a structured architecture tailored to agent activities and examines the feasibility of incorporating LLMs into this framework.

Result: LLMs, when integrated using the proposed structured architecture, align well with the formalized framework and enhance the capability of geosimulation platforms.

Conclusion: The paper establishes that LLMs can be core components of next-generation geosimulation systems if structured architectures are followed.

Abstract: We provide a comprehensive examination of agent-based approaches that codify
the principles and linkages underlying multi-agent systems, simulations, and
information systems. Based on two decades of study, this paper confirms a
framework intended as a formal specification for geosimulation platforms. Our
findings show that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively incorporated
as agent components if they follow a structured architecture specific to
fundamental agent activities such as perception, memory, planning, and action.
This integration is precisely consistent with the architecture that we
formalize, providing a solid platform for next-generation geosimulation
systems.

### [307] [Exploring Dynamic Parameters for Vietnamese Gender-Independent ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22964)
*Sotheara Leang,Éric Castelli,Dominique Vaufreydaz,Sethserey Sam*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper proposes using polar parameters with Spectral Subband Centroid Frequencies (SSCFs) and combining them with Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) to enhance Vietnamese automatic speech recognition (ASR) by capturing dynamic characteristics and tonal information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASR systems need improved methods to capture dynamic temporal characteristics and tonal information of speech signals for better recognition.

Method: The study characterizes acoustic transitions using polar parameters in the SSCF ratio plane, combines these features with MFCCs, and uses SSCF0 as a robust tonal feature.

Result: The proposed parameters significantly reduce word error rates and show greater gender independence compared to traditional MFCC-based models.

Conclusion: Incorporating SSCFs with polar parameters and MFCCs improves the performance of Vietnamese ASR systems by leveraging dynamic and tonal speech features effectively.

Abstract: The dynamic characteristics of speech signal provides temporal information
and play an important role in enhancing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). In
this work, we characterized the acoustic transitions in a ratio plane of
Spectral Subband Centroid Frequencies (SSCFs) using polar parameters to capture
the dynamic characteristics of the speech and minimize spectral variation.
These dynamic parameters were combined with Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
(MFCCs) in Vietnamese ASR to capture more detailed spectral information. The
SSCF0 was used as a pseudo-feature for the fundamental frequency (F0) to
describe the tonal information robustly. The findings showed that the proposed
parameters significantly reduce word error rates and exhibit greater gender
independence than the baseline MFCCs.

### [308] [MECAT: A Multi-Experts Constructed Benchmark for Fine-Grained Audio Understanding Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23511)
*Yadong Niu,Tianzi Wang,Heinrich Dinkel,Xingwei Sun,Jiahao Zhou,Gang Li,Jizhong Liu,Xunying Liu,Junbo Zhang,Jian Luan*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces MECAT, a benchmark for nuanced audio understanding tasks, complemented by a detailed metric named DATE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for audio-language models cannot reliably evaluate nuanced human-level understanding.

Method: MECAT integrates outputs from specialized expert models with Chain-of-Thought reasoning to generate fine-grained data for evaluation. DATE metric rewards detailed descriptions and penalizes generic terms.

Result: MECAT provides multi-perspective captions and Q&A pairs, while DATE enhances evaluation with semantic and discriminability measures. Comprehensive performance assessments are also shared.

Conclusion: MECAT and DATE improve both the benchmarking and evaluation process for audio-language models, addressing gaps in nuanced comprehension evaluation.

Abstract: While large audio-language models have advanced open-ended audio
understanding, they still fall short of nuanced human-level comprehension. This
gap persists largely because current benchmarks, limited by data annotations
and evaluation metrics, fail to reliably distinguish between generic and highly
detailed model outputs. To this end, this work introduces MECAT, a Multi-Expert
Constructed Benchmark for Fine-Grained Audio Understanding Tasks. Generated via
a pipeline that integrates analysis from specialized expert models with
Chain-of-Thought large language model reasoning, MECAT provides
multi-perspective, fine-grained captions and open-set question-answering pairs.
The benchmark is complemented by a novel metric: DATE (Discriminative-Enhanced
Audio Text Evaluation). This metric penalizes generic terms and rewards
detailed descriptions by combining single-sample semantic similarity with
cross-sample discriminability. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art
audio models is also presented, providing new insights into their current
capabilities and limitations. The data and code are available at

*Thomas Compton*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates topic modeling approaches, specifically BERTopic, to understand parameter trade-offs and ensure responsible use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the growing interest in topic models for summarizing text while ensuring their outputs are scrutinized rather than blindly accepted.

Method: The paper evaluates insights from 1140 runs of the BERTopic model, focusing on parameter optimization.

Result: Trade-offs in optimizing parameters for topic models were identified.

Conclusion: The findings enable more interpretable and responsible use of topic models.

Abstract: Topic models are gaining increasing commercial and academic interest for
their ability to summarize large volumes of unstructured text. As unsupervised
machine learning methods, they enable researchers to explore data and help
general users understand key themes in large text collections. However, they
risk becoming a 'black box', where users input data and accept the output as an
accurate summary without scrutiny. This article evaluates topic models from a
database perspective, drawing insights from 1140 BERTopic model runs. The goal
is to identify trade-offs in optimizing model parameters and to reflect on what
these findings mean for the interpretation and responsible use of topic models

### [310] [Are Recommenders Self-Aware? Label-Free Recommendation Performance Estimation via Model Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23208)
*Jiayu Li,Ziyi Ye,Guohao Jian,Zhiqiang Guo,Weizhi Ma,Qingyao Ai,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper explores whether recommendation models can estimate their performance without external labels using a new probability-based method called List Distribution uncertainty (LiDu).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable recommendation systems to self-assess their uncertainty and performance, allowing for better understanding and decision-making before interacting with users.

Method: The paper introduces LiDu, which quantifies uncertainty by calculating the probability of a recommender generating a specific ranking list based on item prediction distributions. It is tested on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that LiDu correlates more strongly with recommendation performance than other label-free estimators and provides insights into models' internal states during training and inference.

Conclusion: LiDu establishes a meaningful link between recommendation uncertainty and performance, paving the way for more transparent and self-evaluating recommendation systems.

Abstract: Can a recommendation model be self-aware? This paper investigates the
recommender's self-awareness by quantifying its uncertainty, which provides a
label-free estimation of its performance. Such self-assessment can enable more
informed understanding and decision-making before the recommender engages with
any users. To this end, we propose an intuitive and effective method,
probability-based List Distribution uncertainty (LiDu). LiDu measures
uncertainty by determining the probability that a recommender will generate a
certain ranking list based on the prediction distributions of individual items.
We validate LiDu's ability to represent model self-awareness in two settings:
(1) with a matrix factorization model on a synthetic dataset, and (2) with
popular recommendation algorithms on real-world datasets. Experimental results
show that LiDu is more correlated with recommendation performance than a series
of label-free performance estimators. Additionally, LiDu provides valuable
insights into the dynamic inner states of models throughout training and
inference. This work establishes an empirical connection between recommendation
uncertainty and performance, framing it as a step towards more transparent and
self-evaluating recommender systems.

### [311] [Not Just What, But When: Integrating Irregular Intervals to LLM for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23209)
*Wei-Wei Du,Takuma Udagawa,Kei Tateno*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces IntervalLLM, a framework integrating time intervals into sequential recommendation tasks using interval-infused attention, showing superior performance across traditional and cold-start scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitation in sequential recommendation tasks that fails to capture dynamic intervals between items, offering a more comprehensive approach for user profiling.

Method: The framework IntervalLLM integrates interval information into LLMs and incorporates interval-infused attention, while introducing the interval perspective to evaluate cold-start recommendation methods.

Result: Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrated that IntervalLLM improves recommendation accuracy by 4.4% and is the best performer in warm and cold scenarios across different perspectives.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of intervals in enhancing recommendation systems and calls for further research to tackle interval-based cold-start challenges.

Abstract: Time intervals between purchasing items are a crucial factor in sequential
recommendation tasks, whereas existing approaches focus on item sequences and
often overlook by assuming the intervals between items are static. However,
dynamic intervals serve as a dimension that describes user profiling on not
only the history within a user but also different users with the same item
history. In this work, we propose IntervalLLM, a novel framework that
integrates interval information into LLM and incorporates the novel
interval-infused attention to jointly consider information of items and
intervals. Furthermore, unlike prior studies that address the cold-start
scenario only from the perspectives of users and items, we introduce a new
viewpoint: the interval perspective to serve as an additional metric for
evaluating recommendation methods on the warm and cold scenarios. Extensive
experiments on 3 benchmarks with both traditional- and LLM-based baselines
demonstrate that our IntervalLLM achieves not only 4.4% improvements in average
but also the best-performing warm and cold scenarios across all users, items,
and the proposed interval perspectives. In addition, we observe that the cold
scenario from the interval perspective experiences the most significant
performance drop among all recommendation methods. This finding underscores the
necessity of further research on interval-based cold challenges and our
integration of interval information in the realm of sequential recommendation
tasks. Our code is available here:

*Fan Li,Chang Meng,Jiaqi Fu,Shuchang Liu,Jiashuo Zhang,Tianke Zhang,Xueliang Wang,Xiaoqiang Feng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Personalized Landing Page Modeling (PLPM) to improve online user navigation and engagement, proposing the KLAN framework, which delivered measurable improvements on the Kuaishou platform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand and optimize Stage I interactions where users navigate to specific pages, addressing the gap in research focus compared to sequential recommendation tasks in Stage II.

Method: Proposed a hierarchical solution framework, KLAN, which includes components for static page preference, dynamic interest transitions, and integration for navigation decisions.

Result: Demonstrated KLAN’s effectiveness through +0.205% improvement in Daily Active Users (DAU) and +0.192% in user Lifetime (LT) on Kuaishou platform.

Conclusion: KLAN improves user navigation and engagement, has been deployed to serve millions, and data/code will be shared to foster future research.

Abstract: Modern online platforms configure multiple pages to accommodate diverse user
needs. This multi-page architecture inherently establishes a two-stage
interaction paradigm between the user and the platform: (1) Stage I: page
navigation, navigating users to a specific page and (2) Stage II: in-page
interaction, where users engage with customized content within the specific
page. While the majority of research has been focusing on the sequential
recommendation task that improves users' feedback in Stage II, there has been
little investigation on how to achieve better page navigation in Stage I. To
fill this gap, we formally define the task of Personalized Landing Page
Modeling (PLPM) into the field of recommender systems: Given a user upon app
entry, the goal of PLPM is to proactively select the most suitable landing page
from a set of candidates (e.g., functional tabs, content channels, or
aggregation pages) to optimize the short-term PDR metric and the long-term user
engagement and satisfaction metrics, while adhering to industrial constraints.
Additionally, we propose KLAN (Kuaishou Landing-page Adaptive Navigator), a
hierarchical solution framework designed to provide personalized landing pages
under the formulation of PLPM. KLAN comprises three key components: (1)
KLAN-ISP captures inter-day static page preference; (2) KLAN-IIT captures
intra-day dynamic interest transitions and (3) KLAN-AM adaptively integrates
both components for optimal navigation decisions. Extensive online experiments
conducted on the Kuaishou platform demonstrate the effectiveness of KLAN,
obtaining +0.205% and +0.192% improvements on in Daily Active Users (DAU) and
user Lifetime (LT). Our KLAN is ultimately deployed on the online platform at
full traffic, serving hundreds of millions of users. To promote further
research in this important area, we will release our dataset and code upon
paper acceptance.

*Yixuan Mi,Yiduo Yu,Yiyi Zhao*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: SmartCourse is an AI-driven system designed for undergraduate Computer Science advising using transcript and plan data for personalized recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and limitations of traditional course advising tools by providing context-aware, AI-enhanced guidance specific to students' academic needs and trajectories.

Method: SmartCourse integrates a CLI and Gradio web GUI for system interaction, and employs a locally hosted large language model for personalized course recommendations, using transcript and degree plan data to generate context-aware advice. Evaluation was conducted using 25 advising queries and custom metrics to measure recommendation quality.

Result: Experiments revealed that utilizing full context (transcript and plan data) significantly improves the relevance of course recommendations compared to context-omitted scenarios.

Conclusion: SmartCourse effectively enhances academic planning and advising through the use of transcript-aware AI, paving the way for better academic guidance systems.

Abstract: We present SmartCourse, an integrated course management and AI-driven
advising system for undergraduate students (specifically tailored to the
Computer Science (CPS) major). SmartCourse addresses the limitations of
traditional advising tools by integrating transcript and plan information for
student-specific context. The system combines a command-line interface (CLI)
and a Gradio web GUI for instructors and students, manages user accounts,
course enrollment, grading, and four-year degree plans, and integrates a
locally hosted large language model (via Ollama) for personalized course
recommendations. It leverages transcript and major plan to offer contextual
advice (e.g., prioritizing requirements or retakes). We evaluated the system on
25 representative advising queries and introduced custom metrics: PlanScore,
PersonalScore, Lift, and Recall to assess recommendation quality across
different context conditions. Experiments show that using full context yields
substantially more relevant recommendations than context-omitted modes,
confirming the necessity of transcript and plan information for personalized
academic advising. SmartCourse thus demonstrates how transcript-aware AI can
enhance academic planning.

*Shou'ang Wei,Xinyun Wang,Shuzhen Bi,Jian Chen,Ruijia Li,Bo Jiang,Xin Lin,Min Zhang,Yu Song,BingDong Li,Aimin Zhou,Hao Hao*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces ELMES, an open-source framework for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in educational settings with scenario-specific metrics and a modular, adaptable architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation benchmarks of LLMs focus on general intelligence and are inadequate for assessing pedagogical capabilities, necessitating targeted metrics for educational scenarios.

Method: Developed ELMES, a modular framework with LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation for quantifying educational metrics, and benchmarked models across four educational tasks using fine-tuned metrics co-created with education specialists.

Result: Systematic benchmarking revealed LLMs have context-dependent strengths and weaknesses in the four investigated educational scenarios.

Conclusion: ELMES lowers entry barriers for applying LLMs in education, enhances the evaluation of pedagogical capabilities, and is publicly available for use and iteration.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents transformative
opportunities for education, generating numerous novel application scenarios.
However, significant challenges remain: evaluation metrics vary substantially
across different educational scenarios, while many emerging scenarios lack
appropriate assessment metrics. Current benchmarks predominantly measure
general intelligence rather than pedagogical capabilities. To address this gap,
we introduce ELMES, an open-source automated evaluation framework specifically
designed for assessing LLMs in educational settings. ELMES features a modular
architecture that enables researchers to create dynamic, multi-agent dialogues
through simple configuration files, facilitating flexible scenario design
without requiring extensive programming expertise. The framework incorporates a
hybrid evaluation engine that objectively quantifies traditionally subjective
pedagogical metrics using an LLM-as-a-Judge methodology. We conduct systematic
benchmarking of state-of-the-art LLMs across four critical educational
scenarios: Knowledge Point Explanation, Guided Problem-Solving Teaching,
Interdisciplinary Lesson Plan Generation, and Contextualized Question
Generation, employing fine-grained metrics developed in collaboration with
education specialists. Our results demonstrate distinct capability
distributions among models, revealing context-specific strengths and
limitations. ELMES provides educators and researchers with an accessible
evaluation framework that significantly reduces adaptation barriers for diverse
educational applications while advancing the practical implementation of LLMs
in pedagogy. The framework is publicly available at
\emph{https://github.com/sii-research/elmes.git}.

*Diego Russo,Gian Marco Orlando,Valerio La Gatta,Vincenzo Moscato*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automated framework for associating new AI failure reports with incidents in the AI Incident Database using semantic similarity modeling, enhancing scalability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deployment of AI in critical domains has exposed vulnerabilities leading to societal harm. Existing manual association methods in the AI Incident Database limit scalability and delay failure pattern identification.

Method: The researchers developed a retrieval-based framework treating the task as a ranking problem, leveraging embedding cosine similarity and comparing various models, including transformer-based sentence embeddings.

Result: Transformer-based embeddings consistently outperformed traditional methods. Combining titles and descriptions improved ranking accuracy, and retrieval performance remained stable across description length variations, improving further with expanded training data.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable and effective solution for supporting the AI Incident Database's maintenance, enabling faster and more accurate identification of failure patterns in AI systems.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are transforming critical sectors such
as healthcare, finance, and transportation, enhancing operational efficiency
and decision-making processes. However, their deployment in high-stakes domains
has exposed vulnerabilities that can result in significant societal harm. To
systematically study and mitigate these risk, initiatives like the AI Incident
Database (AIID) have emerged, cataloging over 3,000 real-world AI failure
reports. Currently, associating a new report with the appropriate AI Incident
relies on manual expert intervention, limiting scalability and delaying the
identification of emerging failure patterns.
  To address this limitation, we propose a retrieval-based framework that
automates the association of new reports with existing AI Incidents through
semantic similarity modeling. We formalize the task as a ranking problem, where
each report-comprising a title and a full textual description-is compared to
previously documented AI Incidents based on embedding cosine similarity.
Benchmarking traditional lexical methods, cross-encoder architectures, and
transformer-based sentence embedding models, we find that the latter
consistently achieve superior performance. Our analysis further shows that
combining titles and descriptions yields substantial improvements in ranking
accuracy compared to using titles alone. Moreover, retrieval performance
remains stable across variations in description length, highlighting the
robustness of the framework. Finally, we find that retrieval performance
consistently improves as the training set expands. Our approach provides a
scalable and efficient solution for supporting the maintenance of the AIID.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The abstract describes a musician's exploration of AI music platforms through two albums, questioning authorship and musical identity in collaboration with AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how AI music generation platforms influence artistic processes, authorship, and musical identity.

Method: The author creates two albums using prompt-based AI platforms, adding unique conceptual challenges, then uses a large language model to interview themself to delve deeper into personal and philosophical questions.

Result: The investigation highlights tensions in authorship, identity, and creativity when collaborating with AI, revealing unique musical spaces and transformations.

Conclusion: The study showcases AI's potential to challenge and expand musical creativity while reflecting on the shifts in artistic identity through LLM-aided introspection.

Abstract: I reflect on my experience creating two music albums centered on
state-of-the-art prompt-based AI music generation platforms. The first album
explicitly poses the question: What happens when I collide my junk mail with
these platforms? The second album is a direct response to the first, and toys
with the inability of state-of-the-art prompt-based AI music generation
platforms to generate music that is not ``practiced'', ``polished'', and
``produced''. I seed a large language model (LLM) with information about these
albums and have it interview me, which results in the exploration of several
deeper questions: To what extent am I the author? Where am I in the resulting
music? How is my musical identity changing as I am faced with machines that are
in some ways far more talented than I? What new musical spaces does my work
open, for me or anyone/thing else? I conclude by reflecting on my reflections,
as well as LLM-mediated self-reflection as method.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper studies defenses against blind prompt injection attacks in LLM-based evaluation systems and introduces a framework combining standard and counterfactual evaluations for enhanced security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the vulnerability of LLM-based systems to prompt injection attacks, where manipulated inputs exploit the evaluation process.

Method: The proposed approach integrates Standard Evaluation (SE) with Counterfactual Evaluation (CFE), testing submissions under true and deliberately false ground-truth answers to identify deceptive entries.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the SE+CFE framework effectively detects blind attacks while incurring minimal trade-offs in performance.

Conclusion: The study concludes that combining standard and counterfactual evaluations strengthens the security of LLM-based systems against prompt injection attacks.

Abstract: This paper investigates defenses for LLM-based evaluation systems against
prompt injection. We formalize a class of threats called blind attacks, where a
candidate answer is crafted independently of the true answer to deceive the
evaluator. To counter such attacks, we propose a framework that augments
Standard Evaluation (SE) with Counterfactual Evaluation (CFE), which
re-evaluates the submission against a deliberately false ground-truth answer.
An attack is detected if the system validates an answer under both standard and
counterfactual conditions. Experiments show that while standard evaluation is
highly vulnerable, our SE+CFE framework significantly improves security by
boosting attack detection with minimal performance trade-offs.

*Estelle Ruellan,Eric Clay,Nicholas Ascoli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes using LLMs to analyze infection screenshots from infostealer malware to extract Indicators of Compromise and map attack campaigns, addressing gaps in the existing literature on stealer logs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in reactive analysis of infection artifacts, specifically screenshots, as current literature primarily focuses on proactive malware detection or stealer logs.

Method: A novel approach employing the LLM gpt-4o-mini is introduced to analyze infection screenshots, extract actionable Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) such as URLs and filenames, and identify broader malware campaigns.

Result: The method successfully extracted 337 URLs and 246 files from 1,000 screenshots, uncovering infection vectors like malicious sites, installer files, and exploited software themes. It also identified three distinct malware campaigns.

Conclusion: The research shows that LLM-driven analysis of infection screenshots is a scalable, effective technique for identifying infection workflows, enhancing threat intelligence, and supporting early interventions against malware campaigns.

Abstract: Infostealers exfiltrate credentials, session cookies, and sensitive data from
infected systems. With over 29 million stealer logs reported in 2024, manual
analysis and mitigation at scale are virtually unfeasible/unpractical. While
most research focuses on proactive malware detection, a significant gap remains
in leveraging reactive analysis of stealer logs and their associated artifacts.
Specifically, infection artifacts such as screenshots, image captured at the
point of compromise, are largely overlooked by the current literature. This
paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), more
specifically gpt-4o-mini, to analyze infection screenshots to extract potential
Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), map infection vectors, and track campaigns.
Focusing on the Aurora infostealer, we demonstrate how LLMs can process
screenshots to identify infection vectors, such as malicious URLs, installer
files, and exploited software themes. Our method extracted 337 actionable URLs
and 246 relevant files from 1000 screenshots, revealing key malware
distribution methods and social engineering tactics. By correlating extracted
filenames, URLs, and infection themes, we identified three distinct malware
campaigns, demonstrating the potential of LLM-driven analysis for uncovering
infection workflows and enhancing threat intelligence. By shifting malware
analysis from traditional log-based detection methods to a reactive,
artifact-driven approach that leverages infection screenshots, this research
presents a scalable method for identifying infection vectors and enabling early
intervention.

*Peter F. Michael,Zekun Hao,Serge Belongie,Abe Davis*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces coded illumination to embed temporal watermarks in videos, aiding in distinguishing real scenes from manipulated ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combat the increasing difficulty of distinguishing manipulated videos from authentic ones due to technological advancements.

Method: Introduces subtle modulation via coded illumination to strategically encode a watermark that reflects the unaltered scene.

Result: Demonstrates that adversaries face amplified challenges when attempting to create plausible fake videos under this coding technique.

Conclusion: The approach can protect high-stakes scenarios, offering a robust method for video authenticity verification.

Abstract: The proliferation of advanced tools for manipulating video has led to an arms
race, pitting those who wish to sow disinformation against those who want to
detect and expose it. Unfortunately, time favors the ill-intentioned in this
race, with fake videos growing increasingly difficult to distinguish from real
ones. At the root of this trend is a fundamental advantage held by those
manipulating media: equal access to a distribution of what we consider
authentic (i.e., "natural") video. In this paper, we show how coding very
subtle, noise-like modulations into the illumination of a scene can help combat
this advantage by creating an information asymmetry that favors verification.
Our approach effectively adds a temporal watermark to any video recorded under
coded illumination. However, rather than encoding a specific message, this
watermark encodes an image of the unmanipulated scene as it would appear lit
only by the coded illumination. We show that even when an adversary knows that
our technique is being used, creating a plausible coded fake video amounts to
solving a second, more difficult version of the original adversarial content
creation problem at an information disadvantage. This is a promising avenue for
protecting high-stakes settings like public events and interviews, where the
content on display is a likely target for manipulation, and while the
illumination can be controlled, the cameras capturing video cannot.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: XSpecMesh introduces speculative decoding to speed up auto-regressive mesh generation, achieving 1.7x faster inference without compromising quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the latency issue in auto-regressive mesh generation, which requires numerous next-token predictions during inference and is computationally intensive.

Method: The method involves lightweight multi-head speculative decoding for parallel token predictions, combined with a verification and resampling strategy. Additionally, it uses distillation training to align predictions from decoding heads with the backbone model.

Result: Experiments show a 1.7x speedup in inference time while preserving mesh generation quality.

Conclusion: XSpecMesh successfully accelerates auto-regressive mesh generation without compromising output quality, providing a practical solution for reducing latency in the field.

Abstract: Current auto-regressive models can generate high-quality, topologically
precise meshes; however, they necessitate thousands-or even tens of
thousands-of next-token predictions during inference, resulting in substantial
latency. We introduce XSpecMesh, a quality-preserving acceleration method for
auto-regressive mesh generation models. XSpecMesh employs a lightweight,
multi-head speculative decoding scheme to predict multiple tokens in parallel
within a single forward pass, thereby accelerating inference. We further
propose a verification and resampling strategy: the backbone model verifies
each predicted token and resamples any tokens that do not meet the quality
criteria. In addition, we propose a distillation strategy that trains the
lightweight decoding heads by distilling from the backbone model, encouraging
their prediction distributions to align and improving the success rate of
speculative predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves a 1.7x speedup without sacrificing generation quality. Our code will
be released.

TL;DR: The paper proposes energy-efficient image classification for sensor edge devices using Bayer images in medical applications, achieving 93.06% accuracy with low-power hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of deep neural networks on resource-constrained sensor edge devices, and reduce energy consumption for video capsule endoscopy applications.

Method: The study utilizes a compact CNN with 63,000 parameters processed directly on Bayer images, alongside Viterbi decoding for time-series analysis. Custom hardware (PULPissimo SoC with RISC-V core) is employed for efficient image processing.

Result: The approach achieves 93.06% accuracy in organ classification and consumes only 5.31μJ energy per image. It reduces energy usage by 89.9% compared to traditional methods before entering the small intestine.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates a practical solution for energy-efficient AI applications in medical sensor edge devices, balancing accuracy and hardware limitations for better battery life.

Abstract: For many real-world applications involving low-power sensor edge devices deep
neural networks used for image classification might not be suitable. This is
due to their typically large model size and require- ment of operations often
exceeding the capabilities of such resource lim- ited devices. Furthermore,
camera sensors usually capture images with a Bayer color filter applied, which
are subsequently converted to RGB images that are commonly used for neural
network training. However, on resource-constrained devices, such conversions
demands their share of energy and optimally should be skipped if possible. This
work ad- dresses the need for hardware-suitable AI targeting sensor edge
devices by means of the Video Capsule Endoscopy, an important medical proce-
dure for the investigation of the small intestine, which is strongly limited by
its battery lifetime. Accurate organ classification is performed with a final
accuracy of 93.06% evaluated directly on Bayer images involv- ing a CNN with
only 63,000 parameters and time-series analysis in the form of Viterbi

energy-efficient AI-based image clas- sification approach requiring just 5.31
{\mu}J per image. As a result, it is possible to save an average of 89.9% of
energy before entering the small intestine compared to classic video capsules.

*Huayu Fu,Jiamin Li,Haozhi Qu,Xiaolin Hu,Zengcai Guo*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for automatic segmentation of neuronal topology to address challenges in neuroimaging data analysis, including intricate morphologies and occlusion of fibers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to accelerate neuron annotation and analysis by overcoming challenges in neuronal topology segmentation posed by complex branch morphology and fiber occlusions.

Method: The method includes a deep network producing pixel-level embedding vectors, a novel loss function for distinct neuronal feature learning, an end-to-end segmentation-to-SWC pipeline, and a new topological assessment metric for accurate quality evaluation.

Result: Experiments on the fMOST imaging dataset showed significant error rate reduction in neuronal topology reconstruction compared to classical methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances neuronal segmentation accuracy and reconstruction by combining deep learning, improved evaluation metrics, and innovative pipeline design.

Abstract: Automatic segmentation of neuronal topology is critical for handling large
scale neuroimaging data, as it can greatly accelerate neuron annotation and
analysis. However, the intricate morphology of neuronal branches and the
occlusions among fibers pose significant challenges for deep learning based
segmentation. To address these issues, we propose an improved framework: First,
we introduce a deep network that outputs pixel level embedding vectors and
design a corresponding loss function, enabling the learned features to
effectively distinguish different neuronal connections within occluded regions.
Second, building on this model, we develop an end to end pipeline that directly
maps raw neuronal images to SWC formatted neuron structure trees. Finally,
recognizing that existing evaluation metrics fail to fully capture segmentation
accuracy, we propose a novel topological assessment metric to more
appropriately quantify the quality of neuron segmentation and reconstruction.
Experiments on our fMOST imaging dataset demonstrate that, compared to several
classical methods, our approach significantly reduces the error rate in
neuronal topology reconstruction.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: PancreasDG introduces a robust dataset of 563 multi-center MRI scans for pancreas segmentation aimed at improving domain generalization benchmarks in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pancreas segmentation holds significance due to its importance in detecting cancer, enabling surgeries, and advancing diabetes research, yet remains a major challenge owing to variability in MR protocols and the organ’s anatomical complexity.

Method: The study leverages a multi-center dataset covering diverse MRI sequences, along with double-blind segmentation masks and proposes a semi-supervised approach employing anatomical invariances.

Result: The semi-supervised model achieves substantial improvements in Dice scores, demonstrating enhanced accuracy over state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques.

Conclusion: PancreasDG sets a new standard for domain generalization by addressing variability in MRI protocols, broadening benchmarks, and delivering superior segmentation accuracy, with open access resources for future research.

Abstract: Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences
whose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them.
Existing domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts
and overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains
a major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly,
surrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast.
State-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or
kidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically
under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical
importance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close
this gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas
segmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical
imaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning
both venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both
cross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks
created by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis,
we reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance
that may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance
correlates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii)
cross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a
semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63%
Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence
segmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in
medical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in geospatial analysis caused by varying resolutions in satellite sensors, offering a framework for aligning and super-resolving Landsat imagery using Sentinel imagery as reference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differences in spatial resolution among satellite sensors hinder effective data fusion and applications in geospatial analysis, driving the need for super-resolution techniques tailored for real heterogeneous sensor data.

Method: A framework is developed to align and super-resolve Landsat Sentinel 30m imagery using Sentinel 10m imagery as a reference from the HLS dataset, bridging the resolution gap.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show improved quality of super-resolved Landsat imagery and demonstrate the potential of the method.

Conclusion: The study showcases the feasibility and promise of heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and points toward key considerations for advancing related techniques in the future.

Abstract: High-resolution satellite imagery is essential for geospatial analysis, yet
differences in spatial resolution across satellite sensors present challenges
for data fusion and downstream applications. Super-resolution techniques can
help bridge this gap, but existing methods rely on artificially downscaled
images rather than real sensor data and are not well suited for heterogeneous
satellite sensors with differing spectral, temporal characteristics. In this
work, we develop a preliminary framework to align and Harmonized Landsat
Sentinel 30m(HLS 30) imagery using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 10m(HLS10) as a
reference from the HLS dataset. Our approach aims to bridge the resolution gap
between these sensors and improve the quality of super-resolved Landsat
imagery. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, showing its potential for enhancing satellite-based sensing
applications. This study provides insights into the feasibility of
heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and highlights key
considerations for future advancements in the field.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LesionGen, a Text-to-Image Diffusion Probabilistic Model (T2I-DPM) for generating dermatological images using structured captions to train classifiers effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for skin disease classification face challenges due to the lack of large, diverse, and well-annotated datasets, caused by privacy concerns, high annotation costs, and insufficient demographic representation.

Method: LesionGen employs a T2I-DPM framework trained on dermatological captions derived from expert annotations and concept-guided pseudo-reports. A pretrained diffusion model is fine-tuned using these high-quality image-caption pairs to generate realistic and diverse skin lesion images.

Result: The model achieved classification accuracy comparable to real-image-trained counterparts, with improved performance in worst-case subgroups when using only the synthetic dataset.

Conclusion: LesionGen demonstrates that synthetic datasets, created using a clinically informed framework, can effectively train models for skin disease classification while addressing challenges of data scarcity and diversity.

Abstract: Deep learning models for skin disease classification require large, diverse,
and well-annotated datasets. However, such resources are often limited due to
privacy concerns, high annotation costs, and insufficient demographic
representation. While text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models (T2I-DPMs)
offer promise for medical data synthesis, their use in dermatology remains
underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of rich textual descriptions in
existing skin image datasets. In this work, we introduce LesionGen, a
clinically informed T2I-DPM framework for dermatology image synthesis. Unlike
prior methods that rely on simplistic disease labels, LesionGen is trained on
structured, concept-rich dermatological captions derived from expert
annotations and pseudo-generated, concept-guided reports. By fine-tuning a
pretrained diffusion model on these high-quality image-caption pairs, we enable
the generation of realistic and diverse skin lesion images conditioned on
meaningful dermatological descriptions. Our results demonstrate that models
trained solely on our synthetic dataset achieve classification accuracy
comparable to those trained on real images, with notable gains in worst-case
subgroup performance. Code and data are available here.

it provides unified data structures for the consistent manipulation of MR
datasets and their associated metadata (e.g., k-space trajectories). Second, it
offers a library of composable operators, proximable functionals, and
optimization algorithms, including a unified Fourier operator for all common
trajectories and an extended phase graph simulation for quantitative MR. These
components are used to create ready-to-use implementations of key
reconstruction algorithms. Third, for deep learning, MRpro includes essential
building blocks such as data consistency layers, differentiable optimization
layers, and state-of-the-art backbone networks and integrates public datasets
to facilitate reproducibility. MRpro is developed as a collaborative project
supported by automated quality control. We demonstrate the versatility of MRpro
across multiple applications, including Cartesian, radial, and spiral
acquisitions; motion-corrected reconstruction; cardiac MR fingerprinting;
learned spatially adaptive regularization weights; model-based learned image
reconstruction and quantitative parameter estimation. MRpro offers an

### [327] [Learning Arbitrary-Scale RAW Image Downscaling with Wavelet-based Recurrent Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23219)
*Yang Ren,Hai Jiang,Wei Li,Menglong Yang,Heng Zhang,Zehua Sheng,Qingsheng Ye,Shuaicheng Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a wavelet-based recurrent reconstruction framework for arbitrary-scale RAW image downscaling, achieving better results compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current techniques for image downscaling primarily focus on sRGB domain, which results in image quality issues like blurring and artifacts, highlighting the need for solutions for RAW image downscaling.

Method: The authors developed a framework leveraging wavelet transformation in a coarse-to-fine manner with two key modules: LASDM for structural preservation and HFPM for textural integrity. They also propose an energy-maximization loss and introduce a Real-NIRD dataset.

Result: Extensive evaluations reveal the proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and visually across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively handles arbitrary-scale RAW image downscaling, ensuring better image quality and structural fidelity. Code and dataset are made publicly available.

Abstract: Image downscaling is critical for efficient storage and transmission of
high-resolution (HR) images. Existing learning-based methods focus on
performing downscaling within the sRGB domain, which typically suffers from
blurred details and unexpected artifacts. RAW images, with their unprocessed
photonic information, offer greater flexibility but lack specialized
downscaling frameworks. In this paper, we propose a wavelet-based recurrent
reconstruction framework that leverages the information lossless attribute of
wavelet transformation to fulfill the arbitrary-scale RAW image downscaling in
a coarse-to-fine manner, in which the Low-Frequency Arbitrary-Scale Downscaling
Module (LASDM) and the High-Frequency Prediction Module (HFPM) are proposed to
preserve structural and textural integrity of the reconstructed low-resolution
(LR) RAW images, alongside an energy-maximization loss to align high-frequency
energy between HR and LR domain. Furthermore, we introduce the Realistic
Non-Integer RAW Downscaling (Real-NIRD) dataset, featuring a non-integer
downscaling factor of 1.3$\times$, and incorporate it with publicly available
datasets with integer factors (2$\times$, 3$\times$, 4$\times$) for
comprehensive benchmarking arbitrary-scale image downscaling purposes.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art competitors both quantitatively and visually. The code and
dataset will be released at https://github.com/RenYangSCU/ASRD.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study introduces EMedNeXt, a framework addressing brain tumor segmentation challenges in sub-Saharan Africa with robust performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tumor quantification via manual MRI segmentation is time-intensive and unreliable, particularly in under-resourced areas with lower-quality MRI equipment and scarce radiology expertise.

Method: The framework, EMedNeXt, is based on MedNeXt V2 and incorporates enhancements like improved architecture, a larger region of interest, and a robust model ensembling system.

Result: EMedNeXt achieved high segmentation accuracy with an average LesionWise DSC of 0.897 and NSD values of 0.541 and 0.84 at specified tolerances.

Conclusion: EMedNeXt provides a tailored, robust solution for brain tumor segmentation in resource-constrained regions, addressing challenges of low-quality imaging and expert scarcity.

Abstract: Brain cancer affects millions worldwide, and in nearly every clinical
setting, doctors rely on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose and
monitor gliomas. However, the current standard for tumor quantification through
manual segmentation of multi-parametric MRI is time-consuming, requires expert
radiologists, and is often infeasible in under-resourced healthcare systems.
This problem is especially pronounced in low-income regions, where MRI scanners
are of lower quality and radiology expertise is scarce, leading to incorrect
segmentation and quantification. In addition, the number of acquired MRI scans
in Africa is typically small. To address these challenges, the BraTS-Lighthouse
2025 Challenge focuses on robust tumor segmentation in sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA), where resource constraints and image quality degradation introduce
significant shifts. In this study, we present EMedNeXt -- an enhanced brain
tumor segmentation framework based on MedNeXt V2 with deep supervision and
optimized post-processing pipelines tailored for SSA. EMedNeXt introduces three
key contributions: a larger region of interest, an improved nnU-Net v2-based
architectural skeleton, and a robust model ensembling system. Evaluated on the
hidden validation set, our solution achieved an average LesionWise DSC of 0.897
with an average LesionWise NSD of 0.541 and 0.84 at a tolerance of 0.5 mm and
1.0 mm, respectively.

TL;DR: The paper introduces JPNeO, a JPEG-compatible algorithm enhancing image compression using neural operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve JPEG compression while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing format.

Method: Incorporating neural operators into both encoding and decoding processes to optimize chroma preservation and reconstruction fidelity.

Result: JPNeO achieves reduced memory usage, a smaller parameter count, and performs better than current artifact removal methods.

Conclusion: JPNeO serves as a high-performance compression pipeline offering practical benefits without altering standard JPEG protocols.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in learning-based lossy compression algorithms,
standardizing codecs remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we present
the JPEG Processing Neural Operator (JPNeO), a next-generation JPEG algorithm
that maintains full backward compatibility with the current JPEG format. Our
JPNeO improves chroma component preservation and enhances reconstruction
fidelity compared to existing artifact removal methods by incorporating neural
operators in both the encoding and decoding stages. JPNeO achieves practical
benefits in terms of reduced memory usage and parameter count. We further
validate our hypothesis about the existence of a space with high mutual
information through empirical evidence. In summary, the JPNeO functions as a
high-performance out-of-the-box image compression pipeline without changing
source coding's protocol. Our source code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper explores continual learning techniques to improve deep learning-based malaria diagnostic tools' adaptability to domain shifts, enhancing their deployment in diverse clinical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malaria remains a global health issue, and current CAD systems face challenges in generalizing across different clinical sites, restricting their practical application.

Method: The study frames domain-incremental learning using a YOLO-based object detector and tests four continual learning strategies (two rehearsal-based and two regularization-based) on multi-site clinical datasets.

Result: Continual learning strategies, especially rehearsal-based methods, were found to significantly improve the adaptability and performance of malaria CAD models across varying acquisition sites.

Conclusion: Continual learning shows strong potential for developing robust and field-ready diagnostic tools for malaria in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Malaria remains a major global health challenge, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert microscopy may be limited. Deep learning-based
computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed and demonstrate
promising performance on thin blood smear images. However, their clinical
deployment may be hindered by limited generalization across sites with varying
conditions. Yet very few practical solutions have been proposed. In this work,
we investigate continual learning (CL) as a strategy to enhance the robustness
of malaria CAD models to domain shifts. We frame the problem as a
domain-incremental learning scenario, where a YOLO-based object detector must
adapt to new acquisition sites while retaining performance on previously seen
domains. We evaluate four CL strategies, two rehearsal-based and two
regularization-based methods, on real-life conditions thanks to a multi-site
clinical dataset of thin blood smear images. Our results suggest that CL, and
rehearsal-based methods in particular, can significantly improve performance.
These findings highlight the potential of continual learning to support the
development of deployable, field-ready CAD tools for malaria.

*Liu Li,Qiang Ma,Cheng Ouyang,Johannes C. Paetzold,Daniel Rueckert,Bernhard Kainz*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel, computationally efficient method for topology-aware medical image segmentation using the Euler Characteristic, improving topological correctness while maintaining pixel-wise accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning-based medical image segmentation techniques often fail to meet clinically acceptable accuracy in preserving topological constraints, such as continuous boundaries or closed surfaces, which are crucial in certain medical applications.

Method: The authors develop a fast formulation for the Euler Characteristic ($\chi$) in 2D and 3D, use the $\chi$ error as a topological evaluation metric, and introduce a topological violation map to highlight errors. They then refine segmentation results using a topology-aware correction network.

Result: The method significantly improves topological correctness of segmentations while maintaining competitive pixel-wise accuracy, as demonstrated in experiments on both 2D and 3D datasets.

Conclusion: Employing Euler Characteristic-based topology-aware adjustments can enhance the clinical relevance and reliability of medical image segmentation models without heavy computational costs.

Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image segmentation techniques have shown
promising results when evaluated based on conventional metrics such as the Dice
score or Intersection-over-Union. However, these fully automatic methods often
fail to meet clinically acceptable accuracy, especially when topological
constraints should be observed, e.g., continuous boundaries or closed surfaces.
In medical image segmentation, the correctness of a segmentation in terms of
the required topological genus sometimes is even more important than the
pixel-wise accuracy. Existing topology-aware approaches commonly estimate and
constrain the topological structure via the concept of persistent homology
(PH). However, these methods are difficult to implement for high dimensional
data due to their polynomial computational complexity. To overcome this
problem, we propose a novel and fast approach for topology-aware segmentation
based on the Euler Characteristic ($\chi$). First, we propose a fast
formulation for $\chi$ computation in both 2D and 3D. The scalar $\chi$ error
between the prediction and ground-truth serves as the topological evaluation
metric. Then we estimate the spatial topology correctness of any segmentation
network via a so-called topological violation map, i.e., a detailed map that
highlights regions with $\chi$ errors. Finally, the segmentation results from
the arbitrary network are refined based on the topological violation maps by a
topology-aware correction network. Our experiments are conducted on both 2D and
3D datasets and show that our method can significantly improve topological
correctness while preserving pixel-wise segmentation accuracy.

### [332] [An Information Bottleneck Asset Pricing Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23218)
*Che Sun*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: This paper proposes an information bottleneck model to improve Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for financial asset pricing, addressing noise overfitting issues through selective data compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks struggle with overfitting when applied to financial data, mainly due to the low signal-to-noise ratio in such datasets.

Method: The model utilizes mutual information constraints to compress input data while retaining only critical information for asset pricing. It progressively reduces irrelevant information and enhances the meaningful connections between compressed data and predictions.

Result: The proposed model successfully filters out noise during the nonlinear mapping process, achieving more accurate and robust financial asset pricing.

Conclusion: By incorporating the information bottleneck mechanism, the approach effectively handles noisy financial data while leveraging the strength of deep networks to model complex relationships.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have garnered significant attention in financial
asset pricing, due to their strong capacity for modeling complex nonlinear
relationships within financial data. However, sophisticated models are prone to
over-fitting to the noise information in financial data, resulting in inferior
performance. To address this issue, we propose an information bottleneck asset
pricing model that compresses data with low signal-to-noise ratios to eliminate
redundant information and retain the critical information for asset pricing.
Our model imposes constraints of mutual information during the nonlinear
mapping process. Specifically, we progressively reduce the mutual information
between the input data and the compressed representation while increasing the
mutual information between the compressed representation and the output
prediction. The design ensures that irrelevant information, which is
essentially the noise in the data, is forgotten during the modeling of
financial nonlinear relationships without affecting the final asset pricing. By
leveraging the constraints of the Information bottleneck, our model not only
harnesses the nonlinear modeling capabilities of deep networks to capture the
intricate relationships within financial data but also ensures that noise
information is filtered out during the information compression process.

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel aerodynamic shape optimization framework combining adjoint-based methods with a diffusion model to enforce a smooth manifold of aerodynamically viable designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To streamline aerodynamic optimization by integrating AI-generated priors and eliminating ad hoc parameter tuning while improving aerodynamic performance.

Method: The framework uses adjoint gradients for design objectives, backpropagates through a diffusion model's latent space, and incorporates automatic differentiation for robust optimization.

Result: The approach successfully demonstrated superior aerodynamic performance and robustness across various transonic airfoil design cases compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: AI-generated priors combined with adjoint methods enable robust and high-fidelity aerodynamic shape optimization.

Abstract: We introduce an adjoint-based aerodynamic shape optimization framework that
integrates a diffusion model trained on existing designs to learn a smooth
manifold of aerodynamically viable shapes. This manifold is enforced as an
equality constraint to the shape optimization problem. Central to our method is
the computation of adjoint gradients of the design objectives (e.g., drag and
lift) with respect to the manifold space. These gradients are derived by first
computing shape derivatives with respect to conventional shape design
parameters (e.g., Hicks-Henne parameters) and then backpropagating them through
the diffusion model to its latent space via automatic differentiation. Our
framework preserves mathematical rigor and can be integrated into existing
adjoint-based design workflows with minimal modification. Demonstrated on
extensive transonic RANS airfoil design cases using off-the-shelf and
general-purpose nonlinear optimizers, our approach eliminates ad hoc parameter
tuning and variable scaling, maintains robustness across initialization and
optimizer choices, and achieves superior aerodynamic performance compared to
conventional approaches. This work establishes how AI generated priors
integrates effectively with adjoint methods to enable robust, high-fidelity
aerodynamic shape optimization through automatic differentiation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create an efficient, index-free framework for linear algebra compatible with functional programming languages and parallelized computation.

Method: The paper utilizes category theory, defining matrices as morphisms in monoidal semiadditive categories, extending to semiadditive 2-categories for tensors, and implementing operations in 2Vec.

Result: The study provides a generalized framework for linear algebra using semiadditive categories and 2-categories, introducing operations and vectorization in these setups.

Conclusion: The approach bridges linear algebra with category theory, enabling a robust framework for higher-rank tensors and efficient computation in functional programming contexts.

Abstract: To formalize calculations in linear algebra for the development of efficient
algorithms and a framework suitable for functional programming languages and
faster parallelized computations, we adopt an approach that treats elements of
linear algebra, such as matrices, as morphisms in the category of matrices,
$\mathbf{Mat_{k}}$. This framework is further extended by generalizing the
results to arbitrary monoidal semiadditive categories. To enrich this
perspective and accommodate higher-rank matrices (tensors), we define
semiadditive 2-categories, where matrices $T_{ij}$ are represented as
1-morphisms, and tensors with four indices $T_{ijkl}$ as 2-morphisms. This
formalization provides an index-free, typed linear algebra framework that
includes matrices and tensors with up to four indices. Furthermore, we extend
the framework to monoidal semiadditive 2-categories and demonstrate detailed
operations and vectorization within the 2-category of 2Vec introduced by
Kapranov and Voevodsky.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a simulation-based framework using vision transformer-driven encoding for improving spatiotemporal data analysis and parameter inference in biological systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques sacrifice rich interdependent structures in spatiotemporal data for parameter identifiability, creating a barrier to extracting mechanistic insights.

Method: The authors use vision transformer-driven variational encoding to create compact data representations, which are integrated into a likelihood-free Bayesian parameter inference approach.

Result: The framework constructs a structured mesh of latent embeddings from simulation dynamics, offering a reference map to retrieve parameters matching observed biological data.

Conclusion: By combining generative modeling with Bayesian methods, the framework successfully identifies spatial and temporal patterns in complex multivariate systems.

Abstract: Biological systems commonly exhibit complex spatiotemporal patterns whose
underlying generative mechanisms pose a significant analytical challenge.
Traditional approaches to spatiodynamic inference rely on dimensionality
reduction through summary statistics, which sacrifice complexity and
interdependent structure intrinsic to these data in favor of parameter
identifiability. This imposes a fundamental constraint on reliably extracting
mechanistic insights from spatiotemporal data, highlighting the need for
analytical frameworks that preserve the full richness of these dynamical
systems. To address this, we developed a simulation-based inference framework
that employs vision transformer-driven variational encoding to generate compact
representations of the data, exploiting the inherent contextual dependencies.
These representations are subsequently integrated into a likelihood-free
Bayesian approach for parameter inference. The central idea is to construct a
fine-grained, structured mesh of latent representations from simulated dynamics
through systematic exploration of the parameter space. This encoded mesh of
latent embeddings then serves as a reference map for retrieving parameter
values that correspond to observed data. By integrating generative modeling
with Bayesian principles, our approach provides a unified inference framework
to identify both spatial and temporal patterns that manifest in multivariate
dynamical systems.

Motivation: Massive modern datasets demand user-level differential privacy, necessitating bounded contributions per user. Existing methods for enforcing these bounds lack scalability, making them impractical for large-scale applications.

Method: The authors propose a novel distributed algorithm, employing a hypergraph model where users serve as vertices and records correspond to hyperedges. The algorithm runs in rounds, with users proposing records concurrently. Only records with unanimous agreement from owners are incorporated, respecting individual contribution limits.

Result: The proposed algorithm effectively scales to massive real-world datasets, ensuring user-level privacy while maximizing dataset utility.

Conclusion: The paper presents a practical, efficient solution for user-level differential privacy in large datasets by exploiting hypergraph structures and distributed processing.

Abstract: In modern datasets, where single records can have multiple owners, enforcing
user-level differential privacy requires capping each user's total
contribution. This "contribution bounding" becomes a significant combinatorial
challenge. Existing sequential algorithms for this task are computationally
intensive and do not scale to the massive datasets prevalent today. To address
this scalability bottleneck, we propose a novel and efficient distributed
algorithm. Our approach models the complex ownership structure as a hypergraph,
where users are vertices and records are hyperedges. The algorithm proceeds in
rounds, allowing users to propose records in parallel. A record is added to the
final dataset only if all its owners unanimously agree, thereby ensuring that
no user's predefined contribution limit is violated. This method aims to
maximize the size of the resulting dataset for high utility while providing a
practical, scalable solution for implementing user-level privacy in large,
real-world systems.

TL;DR: This paper develops and demonstrates a tangible platform for cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) systems using V2X communication, showcasing its benefits via simulations and field tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of research that bridges simulated vehicle platooning systems with practical demonstrations on physical or robot platforms.

Method: Conducted a detailed study of existing longitudinal controllers and implemented them in homogeneous vehicle platoons, followed by simulations and extensive field tests using multiple experimental vehicle platforms.

Result: Simulation and field test results highlight the significant advantages of the proposed CACC platooning approach for longitudinal vehicle scenarios.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the practical feasibility of CACC systems, addressing gaps in literature and paving the way for real-world applications in intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a tangible platform for demonstrating
the practical implementation of cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC)
systems, an enhancement to the standard adaptive cruise control (ACC) concept
by means of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. It involves a detailed
examination of existing longitudinal controllers and their performance in
homogeneous vehicle platoons. Moreover, extensive tests are conducted using
multiple autonomous experimental vehicle platform topologies to verify the
effectiveness of the controller. The outcomes from both simulations and field
tests affirm the substantial benefits of the proposed CACC platooning approach
in longitudinal vehicle platooning scenarios. This research is crucial due to a
notable gap in the existing literature; while numerous studies focus on
simulated vehicle platooning systems, there is lack of research demonstrating
these controllers on physical vehicle systems or robot platforms. This paper
seeks to fill this gap by providing a practical demonstration of CACC systems
in action, showcasing their potential for real-world application in intelligent
transportation systems.

*Abhishek Sawaika,Swetang Krishna,Tushar Tomar,Durga Pritam Suggisetti,Aditi Lal,Tanmaya Shrivastav,Nouhaila Innan,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a federated learning framework leveraging a Quantum LSTM model and FedRansel method to enhance fraud detection, privacy, and resilience in financial data analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to the exponential rise in digital transactions, traditional fraud detection methods face challenges, necessitating innovative solutions to capture complex patterns and ensure data privacy.

Method: The framework combines quantum-enhanced LSTM architectures with privacy-preserving techniques while introducing "FedRansel" to mitigate attacks and improve reliability.

Result: The Quantum LSTM achieves an approximate 5% boost in performance metrics, while FedRansel reduces model degradation and inference accuracy by 4-8% versus conventional methods.

Conclusion: This hybrid approach improves fraud detection, ensures data confidentiality, and secures sensitive financial data against malicious activities.

Abstract: Rapid growth of digital transactions has led to a surge in fraudulent
activities, challenging traditional detection methods in the financial sector.
To tackle this problem, we introduce a specialised federated learning framework
that uniquely combines a quantum-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model
with advanced privacy preserving techniques. By integrating quantum layers into
the LSTM architecture, our approach adeptly captures complex
cross-transactional patters, resulting in an approximate 5% performance
improvement across key evaluation metrics compared to conventional models.
Central to our framework is "FedRansel", a novel method designed to defend
against poisoning and inference attacks, thereby reducing model degradation and
inference accuracy by 4-8%, compared to standard differential privacy
mechanisms. This pseudo-centralised setup with a Quantum LSTM model, enhances
fraud detection accuracy and reinforces the security and confidentiality of
sensitive financial data.

*Elodie Maignant,Xavier Pennec,Alain Trouvé,Anna Calissano*

Main category: math.DG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dimensionality reduction method for unlabeled network data using barycentric subspace analysis (BSA), providing better interpretability compared to PCA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of dimensionality reduction for unlabeled networks, where existing PCA-based methods have interpretability limitations.

Method: The proposed method, BSA, uses subspaces generated by points instead of vectors. A novel embedding using equivalence classes of cospectral networks instead of isomorphic ones is introduced for computational feasibility.

Result: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of BSA on both simulated and real-world datasets, comparing it favorably to tangent PCA.

Conclusion: BSA provides a more interpretable framework for dimensionality reduction in unlabeled network data, overcoming limitations of PCA-based approaches.

Abstract: Certain data are naturally modeled by networks or weighted graphs, be they
arterial networks or mobility networks. When there is no canonical labeling of
the nodes across the dataset, we talk about unlabeled networks. In this paper,
we focus on the question of dimensionality reduction for this type of data.
More specifically, we address the issue of interpreting the feature subspace
constructed by dimensionality reduction methods. Most existing methods for
network-valued data are derived from principal component analysis (PCA) and
therefore rely on subspaces generated by a set of vectors, which we identify as
a major limitation in terms of interpretability. Instead, we propose to
implement the method called barycentric subspace analysis (BSA), which relies
on subspaces generated by a set of points. In order to provide a
computationally feasible framework for BSA, we introduce a novel embedding for
unlabeled networks where we replace their usual representation by equivalence
classes of isomorphic networks with that by equivalence classes of cospectral
networks. We then illustrate BSA on simulated and real-world datasets, and
compare it to tangent PCA.

*Taiyi Wang,Eiko Yoneki*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: AutoIndexer is a framework that improves database index selection using workload compression, query optimization, and specialized reinforcement learning (RL) to reduce complexity and enhance efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the scalability and efficiency of RL-based database index selection, addressing challenges such as large action spaces and high trial-and-error costs in large analytical workloads.

Method: The authors propose AutoIndexer, which uses workload compression, query optimization, and specialized RL models to lower the search complexity and enhance index selection effectiveness.

Result: AutoIndexer reduces query execution time by up to 95% compared to non-indexed baselines, achieves around 20% workload cost savings over state-of-the-art RL-based advisors, and decreases tuning time by over 50%.

Conclusion: AutoIndexer demonstrates high practicality and effectiveness for large and diverse workloads, offering significant performance benefits over traditional index selection methods.

Abstract: Efficiently selecting indexes is fundamental to database performance
optimization, particularly for systems handling large-scale analytical
workloads. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown promise in
automating index selection through its ability to learn from experience, few
works address how these RL-based index advisors can adapt to scaling workloads
due to exponentially growing action spaces and heavy trial and error. To
address these challenges, we introduce AutoIndexer, a framework that combines
workload compression, query optimization, and specialized RL models to scale
index selection effectively. By operating on compressed workloads, AutoIndexer
substantially lowers search complexity without sacrificing much index quality.
Extensive evaluations show that it reduces end-to-end query execution time by
up to 95% versus non-indexed baselines. On average, it outperforms
state-of-the-art RL-based index advisors by approximately 20% in workload cost
savings while cutting tuning time by over 50%. These results affirm
AutoIndexer's practicality for large and diverse workloads.

*Saadiq Rauf Khan,Vinit Chandak,Sougata Mukherjea*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating visualization code and interpreting visualizations. It highlights their potential in simpler tasks but also identifies their limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the ability of LLMs to generate code for visualizations from prompts and to understand visualizations by answering related questions.

Method: Analyzed different LLMs' performance in generating visualization code (e.g., bar, pie charts) and answering questions about visualizations. Limitations were also examined.

Result: LLMs perform well on simple visualizations and questions but struggle with complex visuals (e.g., violin plots) and nuanced interpretation tasks (e.g., relationships in close boundaries).

Conclusion: The study identifies both the potential and limitations of LLMs in visualization tasks and suggests this insight can guide improvements in LLMs and visualization systems.

Abstract: Information Visualization has been utilized to gain insights from complex
data. In recent times, Large Language models (LLMs) have performed very well in
many tasks. In this paper, we showcase the capabilities of different popular
LLMs to generate code for visualization based on simple prompts. We also
analyze the power of LLMs to understand some common visualizations by answering
questions. Our study shows that LLMs could generate code for some simpler
visualizations such as bar and pie charts. Moreover, they could answer simple
questions about visualizations. However, LLMs also have several limitations.
For example, some of them had difficulty generating complex visualizations,
such as violin plot. LLMs also made errors in answering some questions about
visualizations, for example, identifying relationships between close boundaries
and determining lengths of shapes. We believe that our insights can be used to
improve both LLMs and Information Visualization systems.

### [343] [Invisible Architectures of Thought: Toward a New Science of AI as Cognitive Infrastructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22893)
*Giuseppe Riva*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper proposes the new field of Cognitive Infrastructure Studies (CIS), highlighting how AI systems act as invisible "cognitive infrastructures" that condition human cognition, epistemic agency, and decision-making, while introducing methods to study their impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to understand how AI systems reshape human cognition pre-consciously, a critical issue overlooked in current human-AI interaction research, especially in the context of distributed cognition.

Method: The paper introduces narrative scenarios (individual, collective, and societal levels) to describe the reshaping of cognition and proposes novel methodologies like 'infrastructure breakdown methodologies' to study the effects of withdrawing AI preprocessing.

Result: The authors identify significant gaps in existing disciplines (cognitive science, digital sociology, computational approaches) and argue that addressing how AI preprocesses information on multiple scales requires interdisciplinary integration.

Conclusion: CIS provides a framework for examining the invisible influence of AI systems on distributed cognition by integrating diverse disciplinary methods and creating new research tools to expose and analyze cognitive dependencies on AI.

Abstract: Contemporary human-AI interaction research overlooks how AI systems
fundamentally reshape human cognition pre-consciously, a critical blind spot
for understanding distributed cognition. This paper introduces "Cognitive
Infrastructure Studies" (CIS) as a new interdisciplinary domain to
reconceptualize AI as "cognitive infrastructures": foundational, often
invisible systems conditioning what is knowable and actionable in digital
societies. These semantic infrastructures transport meaning, operate through
anticipatory personalization, and exhibit adaptive invisibility, making their
influence difficult to detect. Critically, they automate "relevance judgment,"
shifting the "locus of epistemic agency" to non-human systems. Through
narrative scenarios spanning individual (cognitive dependency), collective
(democratic deliberation), and societal (governance) scales, we describe how
cognitive infrastructures reshape human cognition, public reasoning, and social
epistemologies. CIS aims to address how AI preprocessing reshapes distributed
cognition across individual, collective, and cultural scales, requiring
unprecedented integration of diverse disciplinary methods. The framework also
addresses critical gaps across disciplines: cognitive science lacks
population-scale preprocessing analysis capabilities, digital sociology cannot
access individual cognitive mechanisms, and computational approaches miss
cultural transmission dynamics. To achieve this goal CIS also provides
methodological innovations for studying invisible algorithmic influence:
"infrastructure breakdown methodologies", experimental approaches that reveal
cognitive dependencies by systematically withdrawing AI preprocessing after
periods of habituation.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces an innovative robot system powered by a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) that learns interactively through dialogue with users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create robots that can improve after deployment by learning from interactions, addressing the challenge of encountering novel scenarios.

Method: The method involves using MLLM for interactive learning, with features like natural dialogue-based learning, chain of question strategies to clarify intent, and dual-modality retrieval to avoid repetition of errors.

Result: The system is shown to improve robot performance and adaptability through quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Conclusion: This approach enhances robotic adaptability and user experience, setting a new direction for learning-based robotic systems.

Abstract: It is crucial that robots' performance can be improved after deployment, as
they are inherently likely to encounter novel scenarios never seen before. This
paper presents an innovative solution: an interactive learning-based robot
system powered by a Multi-modal Large Language Model(MLLM). A key feature of
our system is its ability to learn from natural dialogues with non-expert
users. We also propose chain of question to clarify the exact intent of the
question before providing an answer and dual-modality retrieval modules to
leverage these interaction events to avoid repeating same mistakes, ensuring a
seamless user experience before model updates, which is in contrast to current
mainstream MLLM-based robotic systems. Our system marks a novel approach in
robotics by integrating interactive learning, paving the way for superior
adaptability and performance in diverse environments. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and improvement of our method through experiments, both
quantitively and qualitatively.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: RecUserSim is a user simulator for conversational recommender systems, leveraging large language models to enhance simulation realism, interaction diversity, and quantitative evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating conversational recommender systems is challenging due to a lack of realistic and diverse user simulators that can accurately model user behavior and provide quantitative evaluation mechanisms.

Method: RecUserSim integrates modules for user persona definition, interaction memory tracking, nuanced decision-making based on Bounded Rationality theory, and output refinement to enhance its simulation capabilities.

Result: RecUserSim generates diverse and high-quality dialogues, ensuring consistency in ratings across different base language models, even when using smaller LLMs.

Conclusion: RecUserSim successfully addresses the gaps in CRS evaluation by providing a robust, realistic, and controllable user simulation framework.

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) enhance user experience through
multi-turn interactions, yet evaluating CRS remains challenging. User
simulators can provide comprehensive evaluations through interactions with CRS,
but building realistic and diverse simulators is difficult. While recent work
leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate user interactions, they
still fall short in emulating individual real users across diverse scenarios
and lack explicit rating mechanisms for quantitative evaluation. To address
these gaps, we propose RecUserSim, an LLM agent-based user simulator with
enhanced simulation realism and diversity while providing explicit scores.
RecUserSim features several key modules: a profile module for defining
realistic and diverse user personas, a memory module for tracking interaction
history and discovering unknown preferences, and a core action module inspired
by Bounded Rationality theory that enables nuanced decision-making while
generating more fine-grained actions and personalized responses. To further
enhance output control, a refinement module is designed to fine-tune final
responses. Experiments demonstrate that RecUserSim generates diverse,
controllable outputs and produces realistic, high-quality dialogues, even with
smaller base LLMs. The ratings generated by RecUserSim show high consistency
across different base LLMs, highlighting its effectiveness for CRS evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI tools influence novice programmers' learning experience, especially during an exam setting.

Method: The study involved 20 students using AI in a two-part exam: first to complete programming tasks with AI assistance, then extend solutions without AI.

Result: AI was perceived as helpful for understanding code and boosting confidence initially but revealed difficulties in knowledge transfer, including overreliance and gaps in understanding.

Conclusion: AI code assistants are beneficial, but educators need strategies to integrate them effectively while strengthening foundational skills.

Abstract: This exploratory study examines how AI code assistants shape novice
programmers' experiences during a two-part exam in an introductory programming
course. In the first part, students completed a programming task with access to
AI support; in the second, they extended their solutions without AI. We
collected Likert-scale and open-ended responses from 20 students to evaluate
their perceptions and challenges. Findings suggest that AI tools were perceived
as helpful for understanding code and increasing confidence, particularly
during initial development. However, students reported difficulties
transferring knowledge to unaided tasks, revealing possible overreliance and
gaps in conceptual understanding. These insights highlight the need for
pedagogical strategies that integrate AI meaningfully while reinforcing

TL;DR: This study evaluated the performance of an AI-based, multi-agent large language model called Doctronic in a virtual urgent care setting against human clinicians. It found comparable results in diagnostic and treatment accuracy, sometimes surpassing human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the pressing global issues of a projected shortage of healthcare providers and the administrative burden consuming clinical time. It seeks to explore if autonomous AI systems can mitigate these challenges.

Method: The study compared a multi-agent AI system, Doctronic, with human board-certified clinicians in 500 urgent-care telehealth cases, focusing on diagnostic concordance, treatment plan alignment, and safety metrics evaluated through blinded LLM adjudication and expert review.

Result: The AI achieved an 81% diagnostic match rate and a 99.2% treatment plan alignment with human clinicians, with no instances of clinical hallucinations. Expert review found the AI superior in outcomes for 36.1% of discordant cases and inferior in 9.3%.

Conclusion: The study concluded that multi-agent LLM-based AI systems like Doctronic display clinical decision-making capabilities comparable to human practitioners. This highlights their potential role in alleviating the anticipated healthcare workforce shortage.

Abstract: Background: Globally we face a projected shortage of 11 million healthcare
practitioners by 2030, and administrative burden consumes 50% of clinical time.
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to help alleviate these
problems. However, no end-to-end autonomous large language model (LLM)-based AI
system has been rigorously evaluated in real-world clinical practice. In this
study, we evaluated whether a multi-agent LLM-based AI framework can function
autonomously as an AI doctor in a virtual urgent care setting. Methods: We
retrospectively compared the performance of the multi-agent AI system Doctronic
and board-certified clinicians across 500 consecutive urgent-care telehealth
encounters. The primary end points: diagnostic concordance, treatment plan
consistency, and safety metrics, were assessed by blinded LLM-based
adjudication and expert human review. Results: The top diagnosis of Doctronic
and clinician matched in 81% of cases, and the treatment plan aligned in 99.2%
of cases. No clinical hallucinations occurred (e.g., diagnosis or treatment not
supported by clinical findings). In an expert review of discordant cases, AI
performance was superior in 36.1%, and human performance was superior in 9.3%;
the diagnoses were equivalent in the remaining cases. Conclusions: In this
first large-scale validation of an autonomous AI doctor, we demonstrated strong
diagnostic and treatment plan concordance with human clinicians, with AI
performance matching and in some cases exceeding that of practicing clinicians.
These findings indicate that multi-agent AI systems achieve comparable clinical
decision-making to human providers and offer a potential solution to healthcare
workforce shortages.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study examines introducing robots in a church, showing mixed perspectives and focusing on the balance of social and operational roles for robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limited research on using robots in non-profit, socially motivated real-world organizations.

Method: Conducted interviews with 15 church stakeholders and analyzed responses using reflexive thematic analysis.

Result: Findings reveal mixed reactions, identifying empathy concerns and unintended effects while acknowledging robots' potential in information delivery and repetitive duties.

Conclusion: Organizations must weigh social and intangible values alongside financial considerations when determining robots’ roles in such contexts.

Abstract: Recent technological advances have allowed robots to assist in the service
sector, and consequently accelerate job and sector transformation. Less
attention has been paid to the use of robots in real-world organisations where
social benefits, as opposed to profits, are the primary motivator. To explore
these opportunities, we have partnered with a working church and visitor
attraction. We conducted interviews with 15 participants from a range of
stakeholder groups within the church to understand worker perspectives of
introducing a social robot to the church and analysed the results using
reflexive thematic analysis. Findings indicate mixed responses to the use of a
robot, with participants highlighting the empathetic responsibility the church
has towards people and the potential for unintended consequences. However,
information provision and alleviation of menial or mundane tasks were
identified as potential use cases. This highlights the need to consider not
only the financial aspects of robot introduction, but also how social and
intangible values shape what roles a robot should take on within an
organisation.

### [349] [SketchMind: A Multi-Agent Cognitive Framework for Assessing Student-Drawn Scientific Sketches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22904)
*Ehsan Latif,Zirak Khan,Xiaoming Zhai*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces SketchMind, a framework leveraging multi-agent systems to evaluate and improve student-drawn scientific sketches. It surpasses existing AI models in accuracy and provides transparent, pedagogically aligned feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of assessing free-form, visually diverse scientific sketches, which are key to understanding student conceptual growth, using an AI-powered approach that emphasizes interpretability and adaptability.

Method: The proposed SketchMind framework employs multiple modular agents responsible for parsing evaluation rubrics, perceiving sketches, aligning with cognitive principles, and providing iterative feedback for improvement.

Result: SketchMind outperformed baseline AI models like GPT-4o, improving average accuracy from 55.6% to 77.1%. Multi-agent orchestration and system integration further enhanced performance, verified by both quantitative results and human evaluator feedback.

Conclusion: SketchMind demonstrates promise in automating the assessment of scientific sketches while supporting conceptual growth through guided revisions, paving the way for advancements in AI-assisted education.

Abstract: Scientific sketches (e.g., models) offer a powerful lens into students'
conceptual understanding, yet AI-powered automated assessment of such
free-form, visually diverse artifacts remains a critical challenge. Existing
solutions often treat sketch evaluation as either an image classification task
or monolithic vision-language models, which lack interpretability, pedagogical
alignment, and adaptability across cognitive levels. To address these
limitations, we present SketchMind, a cognitively grounded, multi-agent
framework for evaluating and improving student-drawn scientific sketches.
SketchMind comprises modular agents responsible for rubric parsing, sketch
perception, cognitive alignment, and iterative feedback with sketch
modification, enabling personalized and transparent evaluation. We evaluate
SketchMind on a curated dataset of 3,575 student-generated sketches across six
science assessment items with different highest order of Bloom's level that
require students to draw models to explain phenomena. Compared to baseline
GPT-4o performance without SRG (average accuracy: 55.6%), and with SRG
integration achieves 77.1% average accuracy (+21.4% average absolute gain). We
also demonstrate that multi-agent orchestration with SRG enhances SketchMind
performance, for example, GPT-4.1 gains an average 8.9% increase in sketch
prediction accuracy, outperforming single-agent pipelines across all items.
Human evaluators rated the feedback and co-created sketches generated by
\textsc{SketchMind} with GPT-4.1, which achieved an average of 4.1 out of 5,
significantly higher than those of baseline models (e.g., 2.3 for GPT-4o).
Experts noted the system's potential to meaningfully support conceptual growth
through guided revision. Our code and (pending approval) dataset will be
released to support reproducibility and future research in AI-driven education.

*Ismail Hossain,Mridul Banik*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper proposes an innovative system integrating EEG-based BCIs with LLMs to enhance language rehabilitation for users, especially those with neurological impairments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional systems for communication and language learning don't adapt effectively to users with neurological impairments like post-stroke aphasia, leading to ineffective rehabilitation.

Method: The hybrid framework combines real-time noninvasive EEG signals to interpret neural intent and uses LLMs for generating language and adapting exercises tailored to the users' needs.

Result: The system potentially enables users to interact with language-learning modules mentally, personalizes content dynamically, and adapts task difficulty based on cognitive feedback.

Conclusion: Integrating BCIs and LLMs can pave the way for real-time and adaptable AAC and rehabilitation tools that meet diverse user needs.

Abstract: Conventional augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems and
language-learning platforms often fail to adapt in real time to the user's
cognitive and linguistic needs, especially in neurological conditions such as
post-stroke aphasia or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recent advances in
noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG)--based brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) and transformer--based large language models (LLMs) offer complementary
strengths: BCIs capture users' neural intent with low fatigue, while LLMs
generate contextually tailored language content. We propose and evaluate a
novel hybrid framework that leverages real-time EEG signals to drive an
LLM-powered language rehabilitation assistant. This system aims to: (1) enable
users with severe speech or motor impairments to navigate language-learning
modules via mental commands; (2) dynamically personalize vocabulary,
sentence-construction exercises, and corrective feedback; and (3) monitor
neural markers of cognitive effort to adjust task difficulty on the fly.

TL;DR: The study presents a voice-driven AI for stroke evaluations, enabling quick and confident diagnoses by laypersons through expert-level assessments, smartphone video documentation, and aiding emergency care.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current stroke detection by first responders is inconsistent and inaccurate, leading to life-threatening delays in treatment and a need for improved recognition methods.

Method: Three non-medical volunteers used the AI on simulated stroke patients, testing diagnostic accuracy, evaluation times, confidence levels, and expert reviews of AI-generated reports.

Result: The AI system detected 84% stroke signs, 75% likely LVOs, and achieved 86% stroke identification accuracy but flagged false positives in non-stroke cases. Evaluations took ~6 minutes, with high user confidence but necessitating expert review for diagnosis due to AI errors.

Conclusion: While today's system requires human oversight due to AI inaccuracies, advancements in AI may soon achieve highly accurate voice-based stroke assessments, revolutionizing emergency care and enabling rapid, expert-informed decisions.

Abstract: We developed a voice-driven artificial intelligence (AI) system that guides
anyone - from paramedics to family members - through expert-level stroke
evaluations using natural conversation, while also enabling smartphone video
capture of key examination components for documentation and potential expert
review. This addresses a critical gap in emergency care: current stroke
recognition by first responders is inconsistent and often inaccurate, with
sensitivity for stroke detection as low as 58%, causing life-threatening delays
in treatment. Three non-medical volunteers used our AI system to assess ten
simulated stroke patients, including cases with likely large vessel occlusion
(LVO) strokes and stroke-like conditions, while we measured diagnostic
accuracy, completion times, user confidence, and expert physician review of the
AI-generated reports. The AI system correctly identified 84% of individual
stroke signs and detected 75% of likely LVOs, completing evaluations in just
over 6 minutes. Users reported high confidence (median 4.5/5) and ease of use
(mean 4.67/5). The system successfully identified 86% of actual strokes but
also incorrectly flagged 2 of 3 non-stroke cases as strokes. When an expert
physician reviewed the AI reports with videos, they identified the correct
diagnosis in 100% of cases, but felt confident enough to make preliminary
treatment decisions in only 40% of cases due to observed AI errors including
incorrect scoring and false information. While the current system's limitations
necessitate human oversight, ongoing rapid advancements in speech-to-speech AI
models suggest that future versions are poised to enable highly accurate
assessments. Achieving human-level voice interaction could transform emergency
medical care, putting expert-informed assessment capabilities in everyone's
hands.

### [352] [Automated Label Placement on Maps via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22952)
*Harry Shomer,Jiejun Xu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAPLE, a benchmark dataset for automated label placement (ALP) on maps, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for context-aware spatial annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label placement in map design is largely manual, and existing automated systems fail to effectively integrate cartographic standards or adapt to varied contexts.

Method: The authors use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) within instruction-tuned LLMs to process labeling guidelines and generate accurate label placements. They also curate a benchmark dataset, MAPLE, for evaluation.

Result: Four open-source LLMs were evaluated, showing their capability to perform accurate spatial edits with structured prompts and domain-specific retrieval.

Conclusion: The study highlights LLMs' potential for scalable, AI-assisted label placement in maps, aligning outputs with expert cartographic standards and advancing automated map finishing.

Abstract: Label placement is a critical aspect of map design, serving as a form of
spatial annotation that directly impacts clarity and interpretability. Despite
its importance, label placement remains largely manual and difficult to scale,
as existing automated systems struggle to integrate cartographic conventions,
adapt to context, or interpret labeling instructions. In this work, we
introduce a new paradigm for automatic label placement (ALP) that formulates
the task as a data editing problem and leverages large language models (LLMs)
for context-aware spatial annotation. To support this direction, we curate
MAPLE, the first known benchmarking dataset for evaluating ALP on real-world
maps, encompassing diverse landmark types and label placement annotations from
open-source data. Our method retrieves labeling guidelines relevant to each
landmark type leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), integrates them
into prompts, and employs instruction-tuned LLMs to generate ideal label
coordinates. We evaluate four open-source LLMs on MAPLE, analyzing both overall
performance and generalization across different types of landmarks. This
includes both zero-shot and instruction-tuned performance. Our results
demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by structured prompts and domain-specific
retrieval, can learn to perform accurate spatial edits, aligning the generated
outputs with expert cartographic standards. Overall, our work presents a
scalable framework for AI-assisted map finishing and demonstrates the potential
of foundation models in structured data editing tasks. The code and data can be

*William Huang,Xia Su,Jon E. Froehlich,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces Accessibility Scout, a system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess accessibility in physical environments from photos with personalization and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current accessibility assessments are labor-intensive, unscalable, and fail to address the unique needs of individuals.

Method: Accessibility Scout uses LLMs to analyze photos of built environments, adapting assessments based on user-specific mobility levels, preferences, and needs.

Result: Findings from studies show that Accessibility Scout generates personalized accessibility scans, outperforming traditional ADA-focused methods.

Conclusion: Accessibility Scout demonstrates the potential of scalable and personalized accessibility assessments, suggesting new approaches for addressing diverse user needs and paving the way for future developments.

Abstract: Assessing the accessibility of unfamiliar built environments is critical for
people with disabilities. However, manual assessments, performed by users or
their personal health professionals, are laborious and unscalable, while
automatic machine learning methods often neglect an individual user's unique
needs. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable novel approaches
to this problem, balancing personalization with scalability to enable more
adaptive and context-aware assessments of accessibility. We present
Accessibility Scout, an LLM-based accessibility scanning system that identifies
accessibility concerns from photos of built environments. With use,
Accessibility Scout becomes an increasingly capable "accessibility scout",
tailoring accessibility scans to an individual's mobility level, preferences,
and specific environmental interests through collaborative Human-AI
assessments. We present findings from three studies: a formative study with six
participants to inform the design of Accessibility Scout, a technical
evaluation of 500 images of built environments, and a user study with 10
participants of varying mobility. Results from our technical evaluation and
user study show that Accessibility Scout can generate personalized
accessibility scans that extend beyond traditional ADA considerations. Finally,
we conclude with a discussion on the implications of our work and future steps
for building more scalable and personalized accessibility assessments of the
physical world.

*Sebastian Gürtl,Gloria Schimetta,David Kerschbaumer,Michael Liut,Alexander Steinmaurer*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study introduces DUET, an LLM-based tool that provides feedback on UML and ER diagrams, addressing challenges in teaching these topics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teaching UML and ER diagrams is challenging due to complexities in abstract thinking, semantics, and syntax, and traditional teaching techniques struggle to meet these demands effectively.

Method: DUET uses a multi-stage LLM pipeline to convert and compare diagrams and generate reflective feedback. It was evaluated via semi-structured interviews with educators and teaching assistants.

Result: DUET displayed strengths in accessibility, scalability, and learning support but faced challenges in reliability and risks of misuse. Suggestions for improvements like bulk uploads were provided.

Conclusion: LLMs like DUET offer a promising approach for enhancing diagrammatic modeling education and provide a strong foundation for future implementation and evaluation in classrooms.

Abstract: UML and ER diagrams are foundational in computer science education but come
with challenges for learners due to the need for abstract thinking, contextual
understanding, and mastery of both syntax and semantics. These complexities are
difficult to address through traditional teaching methods, which often struggle
to provide scalable, personalized feedback, especially in large classes. We
introduce DUET (Diagrammatic UML & ER Tutor), a prototype of an LLM-based tool,
which converts a reference diagram and a student-submitted diagram into a
textual representation and provides structured feedback based on the
differences. It uses a multi-stage LLM pipeline to compare diagrams and
generate reflective feedback. Furthermore, the tool enables analytical insights
for educators, aiming to foster self-directed learning and inform instructional
strategies. We evaluated DUET through semi-structured interviews with six
participants, including two educators and four teaching assistants. They
identified strengths such as accessibility, scalability, and learning support
alongside limitations, including reliability and potential misuse. Participants
also suggested potential improvements, such as bulk upload functionality and
interactive clarification features. DUET presents a promising direction for
integrating LLMs into modeling education and offers a foundation for future
classroom integration and empirical evaluation.

### [355] [Digital literacy interventions can boost humans in discerning deepfakes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23492)
*Dominique Geissler,Claire Robertson,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study evaluates five digital literacy interventions to improve people's ability to identify deepfakes, showing up to a 13% improvement in discernment without reducing trust in authentic images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes pose risks to societal trust and democratic processes, and there is a need for scalable methods to improve digital literacy for detecting them.

Method: An experiment with 1,200 U.S. participants tested textual guidance, visual demonstrations, gamified exercises, implicit learning, and AI-based explanations as tools for deepfake detection.

Result: Participants improved their ability to discern deepfakes by up to 13% through these interventions, with no reduction in trust in real images.

Conclusion: Digital literacy interventions are scalable, effective, and maintain trust in real images, suggesting they are useful tools to address deepfake-related challenges.

Abstract: Deepfakes, i.e., images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), can erode
trust in institutions and compromise election outcomes, as people often
struggle to discern real images from deepfakes. Improving digital literacy can
help address these challenges, yet scalable and effective approaches remain
largely unexplored. Here, we compare the efficacy of five digital literacy
interventions to boost people's ability to discern deepfakes: (1) textual
guidance on common indicators of deepfakes; (2) visual demonstrations of these
indicators; (3) a gamified exercise for identifying deepfakes; (4) implicit
learning through repeated exposure and feedback; and (5) explanations of how
deepfakes are generated with the help of AI. We conducted an experiment with
N=1,200 participants from the United States to test the immediate and long-term
effectiveness of our interventions. Our results show that our interventions can
boost deepfake discernment by up to 13 percentage points while maintaining
trust in real images. Altogether, our approach is scalable, suitable for
diverse populations, and highly effective for boosting deepfake detection while
maintaining trust in truthful information.

### [356] [LLMs Between the Nodes: Community Discovery Beyond Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22955)
*Ekta Gujral,Apurva Sinha*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The study explores using Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly GPT-4o, combined with graph structure to improve community detection in social networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance community detection methods in social networks by introducing semantic and contextual information using LLMs.

Method: Proposed a two-step framework, CommLLM, leveraging the GPT-4o model and prompt-based reasoning to integrate language model outputs with graph structure. Evaluations were conducted on six real-world datasets using metrics like NMI and ARI.

Result: LLMs, when integrated with graph-aware strategies and instruction-tuned prompts, showed improved community detection accuracy and coherence for small to medium-sized graphs.

Conclusion: LLMs are effective for community detection in graphs when tailored with precise strategies, emphasizing their potential in graph-based research.

Abstract: Community detection in social network graphs plays a vital role in uncovering
group dynamics, influence pathways, and the spread of information. Traditional
methods focus primarily on graph structural properties, but recent advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs) open up new avenues for integrating semantic
and contextual information into this task. In this paper, we present a detailed
investigation into how various LLM-based approaches perform in identifying
communities within social graphs. We introduce a two-step framework called
CommLLM, which leverages the GPT-4o model along with prompt-based reasoning to
fuse language model outputs with graph structure. Evaluations are conducted on
six real-world social network datasets, measuring performance using key metrics
such as Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI),
Variation of Information (VOI), and cluster purity. Our findings reveal that
LLMs, particularly when guided by graph-aware strategies, can be successfully
applied to community detection tasks in small to medium-sized graphs. We
observe that the integration of instruction-tuned models and carefully
engineered prompts significantly improves the accuracy and coherence of
detected communities. These insights not only highlight the potential of LLMs
in graph-based research but also underscore the importance of tailoring model
interactions to the specific structure of graph data.

### [357] [Overcoming error-in-variable problem in data-driven model discovery by orthogonal distance regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23426)
*Lloyd Fung*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces ODR-BINDy, a novel method combining orthogonal distance regression (ODR) with Bayesian model selection, to tackle model discovery from noisy datasets. The approach outperforms existing methods like SINDy, particularly on noise-contaminated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in automatic equation discovery like SINDy, handling noisy datasets remains challenging due to assumptions about noise being solely in the regressand, causing issues with data assimilation and model accuracy.

Method: The method incorporates orthogonal distance regression (ODR) with a Bayesian framework, allowing the governing equations to be treated as soft constraints rather than hard ones, improving robustness against noise.

Result: ODR-BINDy consistently outperformed existing methods, recovering models like Lorenz63 even with noise levels as high as 30%, along with improving performance on other systems like Rossler and Van Der Pol.

Conclusion: ODR-BINDy provides a more accurate and reliable approach to model discovery from sparse and noisy datasets, advancing the field in addressing the limitations of existing methods like SINDy.

Abstract: Despite the recent proliferation of machine learning methods like SINDy that
promise automatic discovery of governing equations from time-series data, there
remain significant challenges to discovering models from noisy datasets. One
reason is that the linear regression underlying these methods assumes that all
noise resides in the training target (the regressand), which is the time
derivative, whereas the measurement noise is in the states (the regressors).
Recent methods like modified-SINDy and DySMHO address this error-in-variable
problem by leveraging information from the model's temporal evolution, but they
are also imposing the equation as a hard constraint, which effectively assumes
no error in the regressand. Without relaxation, this hard constraint prevents
assimilation of data longer than Lyapunov time. Instead, the fulfilment of the
model equation should be treated as a soft constraint to account for the small
yet critical error introduced by numerical truncation. The uncertainties in
both the regressor and the regressand invite the use of orthogonal distance
regression (ODR). By incorporating ODR with the Bayesian framework for model
selection, we introduce a novel method for model discovery, termed ODR-BINDy,
and assess its performance against current SINDy variants using the Lorenz63,
Rossler, and Van Der Pol systems as case studies. Our findings indicate that
ODR-BINDy consistently outperforms all existing methods in recovering the
correct model from sparse and noisy datasets. For instance, our ODR-BINDy
method reliably recovers the Lorenz63 equation from data with noise
contamination levels of up to 30%.

### [358] [Neural Energy Landscapes Predict Working Memory Decline After Brain Tumor Resection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23057)
*Triet M. Tran,Sina Khanmohammadi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how pre-surgical neural dynamics can predict postoperative working memory decline in brain tumor patients, achieving high predictive accuracy using machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain tumor patients undergoing surgical resection face risks of cognitive decline, particularly in working memory, creating a need to predict and mitigate these risks.

Method: The study used fMRI scans to derive energy landscapes of brain interactions in brain tumor patients before surgery. It then employed statistical methods and a random forest model to link these features with postoperative working memory performance.

Result: The model achieved a mean prediction accuracy of 90%, an F1 score of 87.5%, and an AUC of 0.95. Differences in neural energy transitions were found to correlate with working memory outcomes.

Conclusion: Brain tumor-induced changes in neural dynamics prior to surgery are strong predictors of postoperative working memory decline. This can guide personalized surgical and interventional strategies.

Abstract: Surgical resection is the primary treatment option for brain tumor patients,
but it carries the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This study
investigates how tumor-induced alterations in presurgical neural dynamics
relate to postoperative working memory decline. We analyzed functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain tumor patients before surgery and extracted
energy landscapes of high-order brain interactions. We then examined the
relation between these energy features and postoperative working memory
performance using statistical and machine learning (random forest) models.
Patients with lower postoperative working memory scores exhibited fewer but
more extreme transitions between local energy minima and maxima, whereas
patients with higher scores showed more frequent but less extreme shifts.
Furthermore, the presurgical high-order energy features were able to accurately
predict postoperative working memory decline with a mean accuracy of 90\%, F1
score of 87.5\%, and an AUC of 0.95. Our study suggests that the brain
tumor-induced disruptions in high-order neural dynamics before surgery are
predictive of postoperative working memory decline. Our findings pave the path
for personalized surgical planning and targeted interventions to mitigate
cognitive risks associated with brain tumor resection.

### [359] [DNN-based Methods of Jointly Sensing Number and Directions of Targets via a Green Massive H2AD MIMO Receiver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22906)
*Bin Deng,Jiatong Bai,Feilong Zhao,Zuming Xie,Maolin Li,Yan Wang,Feng Shu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The authors propose a two-stage sensing framework for heterogeneous hybrid analog-digital (H2AD) MIMO systems aimed at overcoming challenges in multi-emitter detection, achieving high accuracy in number and direction estimation under varying conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Massive fully-digital MIMO systems suffer from high energy consumption, circuit cost, and complexity. The H2AD MIMO structure has potential to tackle these issues, but intelligent detection of multi-emitters remains a key challenge.

Method: They propose a two-stage framework, including three target sensing methods (EDC, enhanced DNN, improved 1D-CNN) and an OMC-DOA method for Direction of Arrival estimation. The Cramér-Rao lower bound was derived as a benchmark.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate robust performance of the framework. It achieves accurate target number sensing under moderate-to-high SNRs and superior results with 1D-CNN in low SNR. The OMC-DOA method excels in multi-source scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and methods advance sensing capabilities of H2AD MIMO systems, showing promise for future use in wireless networks while addressing current limitations in efficiency and complexity.

Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, the heterogeneous hybrid analog-digital H2AD MIMO
architecture has been shown to own a great potential to replace the massive or
extremely large-scale fully-digital MIMO in the future wireless networks to
address the three challenging problems faced by the latter: high energy
consumption, high circuit cost, and high complexity. However, how to
intelligently sense the number and direction of multi-emitters via such a
structure is still an open hard problem. To address this, we propose a
two-stage sensing framework that jointly estimates the number and direction
values of multiple targets. Specifically, three target number sensing methods
are designed: an improved eigen-domain clustering (EDC) framework, an enhanced
deep neural network (DNN) based on five key statistical features, and an
improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) utilizing full
eigenvalues. Subsequently, a low-complexity and high-accuracy DOA estimation is
achieved via the introduced online micro-clustering (OMC-DOA) method.
Furthermore, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the H2AD under
multiple-source conditions as a theoretical performance benchmark. Simulation
results show that the developed three methods achieve 100\% number of targets
sensing at moderate-to-high SNRs, while the improved 1D-CNN exhibits superior
under extremely-low SNR conditions. The introduced OMC-DOA outperforms existing
clustering and fusion-based DOA methods in multi-source environments.

*Chiara Lambranzi,Giulia Oberti,Christian Di Natali,Darwin G. Caldwell,Manuela Galli,Elena De Momi,Jesùs Ortiz*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: The study explores how anchor point positions in an exosuit affect human gait kinematics, muscle activation, and energy consumption. Optimal configurations depend on individual characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anchor points in exosuits are often overlooked but play a critical role in determining how forces interact with the body, potentially affecting energy efficiency and muscular activation.

Method: Six experiments were conducted with 11 subjects using the XoSoft exosuit in five configurations. Sensors measured motion, muscle activity, and metabolic energy consumption.

Result: Placing the knee anchor point posteriorly and the hip anchor anteriorly reduced hip flexor activation by up to 10.21% and metabolic expenditure by up to 18.45%. Configurations also influenced kinematics of the knee and ankle, even when only the hip was assisted.

Conclusion: Anchor point positions significantly impact exoskeleton performance, but effectiveness varies by individual. Future research should focus on personalizing musculoskeletal models and validating findings in clinical settings.

Abstract: Anchor point placement is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of exosuit
design since it determines how forces interact with the human body. This work
analyzes the impact of different anchor point positions on gait kinematics,
muscular activation and energetic consumption. A total of six experiments were
conducted with 11 subjects wearing the XoSoft exosuit, which assists hip
flexion in five configurations. Subjects were instrumented with an IMU-based
motion tracking system, EMG sensors, and a mask to measure metabolic
consumption. The results show that positioning the knee anchor point on the
posterior side while keeping the hip anchor on the anterior part can reduce
muscle activation in the hip flexors by up to 10.21\% and metabolic expenditure
by up to 18.45\%. Even if the only assisted joint was the hip, all the
configurations introduced changes also in the knee and ankle kinematics.
Overall, no single configuration was optimal across all subjects, suggesting
that a personalized approach is necessary to transmit the assistance forces
optimally. These findings emphasize that anchor point position does indeed have
a significant impact on exoskeleton effectiveness and efficiency. However,
these optimal positions are subject-specific to the exosuit design, and there
is a strong need for future work to tailor musculoskeletal models to individual
characteristics and validate these results in clinical populations.

TL;DR: The study develops a novel method for efficiently searching for optimal transparent conducting materials (TCMs) using an extended FMA framework, significantly outperforming other approaches in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance and reduce the cost of next-generation devices by discovering better transparent conducting materials (TCMs).

Method: The authors extend the FMA framework by combining Factorization Machines and annealing, introducing innovations like variable binarization, Hopfield network solutions, adaptive random flips, and bit-string local searches for material optimization.

Result: The proposed method was validated using competition data and outperformed Bayesian optimization and genetic algorithms in speed and accuracy while excelling at multi-objective optimization for material design.

Conclusion: The method holds promise for solving larger and more complex material design problems, potentially advancing materials informatics by addressing practical experimental conditions.

Abstract: The development of novel transparent conducting materials (TCMs) is essential
for enhancing the performance and reducing the cost of next-generation devices
such as solar cells and displays. In this research, we focus on the
(Al$_x$Ga$_y$In$_z$)$_2$O$_3$ system and extend the FMA framework, which
combines a Factorization Machine (FM) and annealing, to search for optimal
compositions and crystal structures with high accuracy and low cost. The
proposed method introduces (i) the binarization of continuous variables, (ii)
the utilization of good solutions using a Hopfield network, (iii) the
activation of global search through adaptive random flips, and (iv) fine-tuning
via a bit-string local search. Validation using the
(Al$_x$Ga$_y$In$_z$)$_2$O$_3$ data from the Kaggle "Nomad2018 Predicting
Transparent Conductors" competition demonstrated that our method achieves
faster and more accurate searches than Bayesian optimization and genetic
algorithms. Furthermore, its application to multi-objective optimization showed
its capability in designing materials by simultaneously considering both the
band gap and formation energy. These results suggest that applying our method
to larger, more complex search problems and diverse material designs that
reflect realistic experimental conditions is expected to contribute to the
further advancement of materials informatics.

TL;DR: The paper proposes neural likelihood estimation for modeling detector energy response accurately in neutrino experiments through simulation-based inference. It integrates the approach with Bayesian nested sampling, achieving high precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise detector energy response modeling is essential for next-gen neutrino experiments, but lacks analytical likelihoods and faces computational challenges.

Method: The authors developed two neural density estimators: conditional normalizing flows for unbinned likelihood analysis and a transformer-based regressor for binned analysis, integrated with Bayesian nested sampling.

Result: Using JUNO as a case study, the method attained uncertainties limited by statistics and near-zero systematic biases, adapting well to non-linearity and parameter correlations.

Conclusion: The proposed neural likelihood framework demonstrates high flexibility and precision, and it serves as a template for applications in neutrino and particle physics.

Abstract: Precise modeling of detector energy response is crucial for next-generation
neutrino experiments which present computational challenges due to lack of
analytical likelihoods. We propose a solution using neural likelihood
estimation within the simulation-based inference framework. We develop two
complementary neural density estimators that model likelihoods of calibration
data: conditional normalizing flows and a transformer-based regressor. We adopt
JUNO - a large neutrino experiment - as a case study. The energy response of
JUNO depends on several parameters, all of which should be tuned, given their
non-linear behavior and strong correlations in the calibration data. To this
end, we integrate the modeled likelihoods with Bayesian nested sampling for
parameter inference, achieving uncertainties limited only by statistics with
near-zero systematic biases. The normalizing flows model enables unbinned
likelihood analysis, while the transformer provides an efficient binned
alternative. By providing both options, our framework offers flexibility to
choose the most appropriate method for specific needs. Finally, our approach
establishes a template for similar applications across experimental neutrino
and broader particle physics.
