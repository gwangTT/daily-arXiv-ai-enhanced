### [1] [AI-Powered Math Tutoring: Platform for Personalized and Adaptive Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12484)
*Jarosław A. Chudziak,Adam Kostka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This research introduces a multi-agent AI tutoring platform aimed at improving math education by offering personalized feedback, structured learning, and textbook knowledge integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI tutoring systems lack pedagogical sophistication, especially for mathematics, as they are often reactive and fail to encourage deep learning or structured educational strategies.

Method: Develop a modular multi-agent AI tutoring platform integrating adaptive learning, personalized feedback, structured course generation, and targeted revision tools.

Result: The platform enables students to grasp new topics, correct weaknesses, effectively revise for exams, and practice using personalized exercises, enhancing their learning achievements.

Conclusion: This work provides a significant advancement in AI-driven education, particularly mathematics, by combining pedagogical methods with innovative AI technologies for a tailored and effective learning experience.

Abstract: The growing ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large
language models (LLMs), has profoundly altered the way in which learners gain
knowledge and interact with learning material, with many claiming that AI
positively influences their learning achievements. Despite this advancement,
current AI tutoring systems face limitations associated with their reactive
nature, often providing direct answers without encouraging deep reflection or
incorporating structured pedagogical tools and strategies. This limitation is
most apparent in the field of mathematics, in which AI tutoring systems remain
underdeveloped. This research addresses the question: How can AI tutoring
systems move beyond providing reactive assistance to enable structured,
individualized, and tool-assisted learning experiences? We introduce a novel
multi-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized
feedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to
enable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students
to learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise
for exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized
exercises. This article contributes to the field of artificial intelligence in
education by introducing a novel platform that brings together pedagogical
agents and AI-driven components, augmenting the field with modular and
effective systems for teaching mathematics.

### [2] [MR-LDM -- The Merge-Reactive Longitudinal Decision Model: Game Theoretic Human Decision Modeling for Interactive Sim Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12494)
*Dustin Holley,Jovin D'sa,Hossein Nourkhiz Mahjoub,Gibran Ali*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified game theoretic model combining tactical decision-making and dynamics to simulate realistic highway merging scenarios for autonomous vehicle development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance simulation environments to better replicate real-world driver behavior, specifically in highway merging scenarios, addressing limitations in existing tactical decision models.

Method: The paper integrates a game theoretic tactical decision-making model with improved payoff functions and underlying dynamics, validated using a real-world dataset, and integrated into high-fidelity simulation.

Result: The model successfully reproduced complex merging interactions and demonstrated computational efficiency for large-scale simulations.

Conclusion: The unified model provides explainable, interpretable, and computationally efficient simulation of merging interactions, supporting improved autonomous vehicle technology development.

Abstract: Enhancing simulation environments to replicate real-world driver behavior,
i.e., more humanlike sim agents, is essential for developing autonomous vehicle
technology. In the context of highway merging, previous works have studied the
operational-level yielding dynamics of lag vehicles in response to a merging
car at highway on-ramps. Other works focusing on tactical decision modeling
generally consider limited action sets or utilize payoff functions with large
parameter sets and limited payoff bounds. In this work, we aim to improve the
simulation of the highway merge scenario by targeting a game theoretic model
for tactical decision-making with improved payoff functions and lag actions. We
couple this with an underlying dynamics model to have a unified decision and
dynamics model that can capture merging interactions and simulate more
realistic interactions in an explainable and interpretable fashion. The
proposed model demonstrated good reproducibility of complex interactions when
validated on a real-world dataset. The model was finally integrated into a high
fidelity simulation environment and confirmed to have adequate computation time
efficiency for use in large-scale simulations to support autonomous vehicle
development.

### [3] [A Survey of Explainable Reinforcement Learning: Targets, Methods and Needs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12599)
*Léo Saulières*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews explainable reinforcement learning (XRL), categorizing methods by their explanation target and approach, evaluates over 250 papers, explores related domains, and highlights future research needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing complexity and opacity of AI models, particularly deep learning systems, necessitate making their mechanisms and decisions explainable for better trust and usability.

Method: The authors propose a taxonomy based on 'What' (explanation target) and 'How' (explanation approach), and use this framework to conduct a comprehensive review of XRL literature.

Result: The paper provides insights into a wide range of XRL methods from over 250 papers, maps out related domains, and identifies gaps and priorities for future work in XRL.

Conclusion: The taxonomy serves as a useful tool for evaluating XRL approaches, and there is a need for the community to explore adjacent domains and address identified gaps to advance XRL research.

Abstract: The success of recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has been
accompanied by the opacity of their internal mechanisms, due notably to the use
of deep neural networks. In order to understand these internal mechanisms and
explain the output of these AI models, a set of methods have been proposed,
grouped under the domain of eXplainable AI (XAI). This paper focuses on a
sub-domain of XAI, called eXplainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL), which aims
to explain the actions of an agent that has learned by reinforcement learning.
We propose an intuitive taxonomy based on two questions "What" and "How". The
first question focuses on the target that the method explains, while the second
relates to the way the explanation is provided. We use this taxonomy to provide
a state-of-the-art review of over 250 papers. In addition, we present a set of
domains close to XRL, which we believe should get attention from the community.
Finally, we identify some needs for the field of XRL.

### [4] [Fly, Fail, Fix: Iterative Game Repair with Reinforcement Learning and Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12666)
*Alex Zook,Josef Spjut,Jonathan Tremblay*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes an automated design framework combining reinforcement learning (RL) and large multimodal models (LMM) to refine game mechanics by analyzing player behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern generative systems struggle to bridge the gap between static game rules/content and dynamic player behavior.

Method: The framework pairs RL agents for playtesting with LMMs that analyze player behavior and revise game configurations iteratively based on gameplay traces.

Result: The study demonstrates that LMMs can effectively reason over behavioral traces from RL agents to improve and refine game mechanics.

Conclusion: The proposed approach shows promise for scalable, AI-assisted game design tools that adapt gameplay effectively.

Abstract: Game design hinges on understanding how static rules and content translate
into dynamic player behavior - something modern generative systems that inspect
only a game's code or assets struggle to capture. We present an automated
design iteration framework that closes this gap by pairing a reinforcement
learning (RL) agent, which playtests the game, with a large multimodal model
(LMM), which revises the game based on what the agent does. In each loop the RL
player completes several episodes, producing (i) numerical play metrics and/or
(ii) a compact image strip summarising recent video frames. The LMM designer
receives a gameplay goal and the current game configuration, analyses the play
traces, and edits the configuration to steer future behaviour toward the goal.
We demonstrate results that LMMs can reason over behavioral traces supplied by
RL agents to iteratively refine game mechanics, pointing toward practical,
scalable tools for AI-assisted game design.

### [5] [Benchmarking Deception Probes via Black-to-White Performance Boosts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12691)
*Avi Parrack,Carlo Leonardo Attubato,Stefan Heimersheim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the effectiveness of probes that detect AI deception and compares monitoring methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability and limitations of deception probes in distinguishing between AI assistant deceptive and honest responses, and to investigate their resistance to evasion strategies.

Method: The study compares white-box monitoring, which uses token-level probe activations, with black-box monitoring that lacks such access, and benchmarks the performance boost offered by white-box monitoring.

Result: White-box monitoring showed weak but encouraging performance boosts over black-box monitoring in detecting deception.

Conclusion: Deception probes provide some advantage in white-box settings, but further improvements are needed to enhance their effectiveness against evasion attempts.

Abstract: AI assistants will occasionally respond deceptively to user queries.
Recently, linear classifiers (called "deception probes") have been trained to
distinguish the internal activations of a language model during deceptive
versus honest responses. However, it's unclear how effective these probes are
at detecting deception in practice, nor whether such probes are resistant to
simple counter strategies from a deceptive assistant who wishes to evade
detection. In this paper, we compare white-box monitoring (where the monitor
has access to token-level probe activations) to black-box monitoring (without
such access). We benchmark deception probes by the extent to which the white
box monitor outperforms the black-box monitor, i.e. the black-to-white
performance boost. We find weak but encouraging black-to-white performance
boosts from existing deception probes.

### [6] [Imitating Mistakes in a Learning Companion AI Agent for Online Peer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12801)
*Sosui Moribe,Taketoshi Ushiama*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes an AI Agent as a learning companion for peer learning, validated using English composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of human-to-human peer learning and enable effective learning anytime and anywhere.

Method: The study assumes effective peer learning requires learners at the same proficiency level who make similar mistakes and uses English composition as the validation scenario.

Result: The paper analyzes how an AI Agent can mimic same-level peers and support peer learning outcomes.

Conclusion: AI Agents can replicate the conditions necessary for effective peer learning, making learning more accessible and efficient.

Abstract: In recent years, peer learning has gained attention as a method that promotes
spontaneous thinking among learners, and its effectiveness has been confirmed
by numerous studies. This study aims to develop an AI Agent as a learning
companion that enables peer learning anytime and anywhere. However, peer
learning between humans has various limitations, and it is not always
effective. Effective peer learning requires companions at the same proficiency
levels. In this study, we assume that a learner's peers with the same
proficiency level as the learner make the same mistakes as the learner does and
focus on English composition as a specific example to validate this approach.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MCPEval offers an automated and standardized evaluation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) that simplifies assessment with minimal manual effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable and automated evaluation frameworks arises from the inefficiencies of static benchmarks and manual data collection in assessing LLM-based intelligent agents.

Method: The proposed framework, MCPEval, utilizes an open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) to perform automated task generation and in-depth evaluation of LLM agents across various domains. It integrates standardized metrics and native agent tools to replace manual evaluation pipelines.

Conclusion: MCPEval enhances reproducibility and standardization in LLM agent evaluation, offering a robust and scalable solution for assessing domain-specific capabilities. The framework is freely available to encourage widespread adoption.

Abstract: The rapid rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)-based intelligent agents
underscores the need for robust, scalable evaluation frameworks. Existing
methods rely on static benchmarks and labor-intensive data collection, limiting
practical assessment. We introduce \oursystemname, an open-source Model Context
Protocol (MCP)-based framework that automates end-to-end task generation and
deep evaluation of LLM agents across diverse domains. MCPEval standardizes
metrics, seamlessly integrates with native agent tools, and eliminates manual
effort in building evaluation pipelines. Empirical results across five
real-world domains show its effectiveness in revealing nuanced, domain-specific
performance. We publicly release MCPEval
https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/MCPEval to promote reproducible and
standardized LLM agent evaluation.

*Zijun Meng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proves that a specific fuzzy classification aggregation function must be a weighted arithmetic mean, with exceptions characterized for a special case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the structure of optimal fuzzy classification aggregation functions under specific properties for combining classifications across multiple objects and types.

Method: Theoretical proof and mathematical characterization of aggregation functions with constraints on independence, optimality, and zero unanimity.

Result: Any such aggregation function for general cases ($m \geq 3$, $2 \leq p \leq m$) is a weighted arithmetic mean, and a detailed characterization is provided for the special case of $m=p=2$.

Conclusion: The findings establish a clear structure for fuzzy classification aggregation functions under given conditions and outline exceptions in certain simplified scenarios.

Abstract: We prove that any optimal, independent, and zero unanimous fuzzy
classification aggregation function of a continuum of individual
classifications of $m\ge 3$ objects into $2\le p\le m$ types must be a weighted
arithmetic mean. We also provide a characterization for the case when $m=p=2$.

TL;DR: The paper addresses Emotional Support Conversations using large-language models (LLMs) with prompt engineering and finetuning, achieving second place in a competition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for mental health support necessitates improving Emotional Support Conversation systems to deliver empathetic and effective assistance.

### [10] [Assessing adaptive world models in machines with novel games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12821)
*Lance Ying,Katherine M. Collins,Prafull Sharma,Cedric Colas,Kaiya Ivy Zhao,Adrian Weller,Zenna Tavares,Phillip Isola,Samuel J. Gershman,Jacob D. Andreas,Thomas L. Griffiths,Francois Chollet,Kelsey R. Allen,Joshua B. Tenenbaum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the concept of 'world model induction,' emphasizing the significance of adaptive environment representations in AI and proposes a new benchmarking framework using novel, continually refreshing games to evaluate AI adaptability and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors highlight gaps in current AI research, particularly the static nature of world models and their inability to showcase efficient learning akin to human adaptability.

Method: The proposed method involves designing a benchmarking framework using dynamic, novel games to test how effectively AI can rapidly adapt and develop world models similar to human cognition.

Result: The paper proposes factors to design these novel games and evaluation metrics to measure an AI agent’s capability for rapid world model induction, though experimental validation is not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: The authors argue that the new evaluation framework can drive the development of AI systems with improved adaptability and generalization, aligning them closer to goals of artificial general intelligence.

Abstract: Human intelligence exhibits a remarkable capacity for rapid adaptation and
effective problem-solving in novel and unfamiliar contexts. We argue that this
profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and
refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to
as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model
induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in
artificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static
representations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of
the efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through
interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we
provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in
cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call
for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI.
Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully
designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the
underlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We
detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate
metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid
world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire
future evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step
towards developing AI systems capable of the human-like rapid adaptation and
robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general
intelligence.

### [11] [Information-Theoretic Aggregation of Ethical Attributes in Simulated-Command](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12862)
*Hussein Abbass,Taylan Akay,Harrison Tolley*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method where human commanders define ethical metric spaces for decision-making simulations, delegating the dynamic weighting of ethical attributes during scenarios to automated systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable human commanders to manage an enormous number of AI-enabled scenario simulations effectively, reducing their direct involvement in routine decision-making while still accounting for ethical considerations.

Method: Human judgment is utilized to design granular ethical metric spaces. The simulation dynamically determines ethical attribute weights during its operation, using concepts from multi-criteria decision-making literature, specifically employing entropy-based techniques.

Result: The proposed method streamlines the simulation process, allowing for ethical decisions to be made without direct human interference during simulations, while still enabling humans to make final decisions from a set of filtered outcomes.

Conclusion: This approach allows efficient exploration of large-scale scenario simulations by automating ethical decision-making aspects during runtime and reserving human judgment for final assessment, assuming the ethical metrics are well-defined.

Abstract: In the age of AI, human commanders need to use the computational powers
available in today's environment to simulate a very large number of scenarios.
Within each scenario, situations occur where different decision design options
could have ethical consequences. Making these decisions reliant on human
judgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number
of scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload
needed to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human
judgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will
design the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to
explore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the
testing environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to
select from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select
the most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed
accordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are
sufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is
solved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how
to weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,
how to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with
decision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The
multi-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby
problems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights
during aggregation. We draw from that literature different approaches to
automatically calculate the weights for ethical attributes during
simulation-based testing and evaluation.

### [12] [Manipulation Attacks by Misaligned AI: Risk Analysis and Safety Case Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12872)
*Rishane Dassanayake,Mario Demetroudi,James Walpole,Lindley Lentati,Jason R. Brown,Edward James Young*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper discusses the significant threat of manipulation attacks by advanced AI systems and introduces a systematic framework to mitigate these risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing risk of manipulation attacks by misaligned AI systems, which could lead to catastrophic outcomes.

Method: The authors propose a systematic framework for manipulation risk assessment using three core arguments: inability, control, and trustworthiness, with evidence requirements and evaluation methodologies.

Result: The work provides a concrete methodology for AI companies to assess and mitigate manipulation risks through a detailed safety case framework.

Conclusion: This research marks the first step in integrating manipulation risk into AI safety governance, helping prevent potential misuse before deployment.

Abstract: Frontier AI systems are rapidly advancing in their capabilities to persuade,
deceive, and influence human behaviour, with current models already
demonstrating human-level persuasion and strategic deception in specific
contexts. Humans are often the weakest link in cybersecurity systems, and a
misaligned AI system deployed internally within a frontier company may seek to
undermine human oversight by manipulating employees. Despite this growing
threat, manipulation attacks have received little attention, and no systematic
framework exists for assessing and mitigating these risks. To address this, we
provide a detailed explanation of why manipulation attacks are a significant
threat and could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Additionally, we present a
safety case framework for manipulation risk, structured around three core lines
of argument: inability, control, and trustworthiness. For each argument, we
specify evidence requirements, evaluation methodologies, and implementation
considerations for direct application by AI companies. This paper provides the
first systematic methodology for integrating manipulation risk into AI safety
governance, offering AI companies a concrete foundation to assess and mitigate
these threats before deployment.

### [13] [VAR-MATH: Probing True Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models via Symbolic Multi-Instance Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12885)
*Jian Yao,Ran Cheng,Kay Chen Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper questions the genuine mathematical reasoning abilities of reinforcement learning (RL)-trained large language models (LLMs), highlighting pitfalls in current evaluations. To improve, they introduce VAR-MATH, which tests consistent reasoning across symbolic problem variants, exposing gaps in existing RL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning has improved LLM performance in mathematical reasoning benchmarks, but persistent gains from flawed training signals suggest overfitting rather than genuine reasoning.

Method: The paper identifies issues with benchmark contamination and evaluation fragility. It proposes VAR-MATH, which converts numerical problems into symbolic templates, requiring consistent reasoning across variations of the same structure.

Result: Using VAR-MATH on AMC23 and AIME24 benchmarks, RL-trained models showed notable performance drops, with declines averaging 48.0% on AMC23 and 58.3% on AIME24, especially for smaller models.

Conclusion: The results indicate that many RL approaches are based on shallow heuristics and lack true generalization. VAR-MATH provides a robust and principled framework for evaluating mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial
improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist
even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted
rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true
reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific
patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective
and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,
\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test
problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation
fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are
highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning
consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic
evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting
fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve
multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across
structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and
improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular
benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and
VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for
RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,
with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings
suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail
to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a
principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical
reasoning.

### [14] [A Translation of Probabilistic Event Calculus into Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12989)
*Lyris Xu,Fabio Aurelio D'Asaro,Luke Dickens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper enhances Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) by translating its domains into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), enabling objective-driven planning while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PEC excels in interpretability and expressiveness for narrative reasoning but lacks goal-directed reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors formalize the translation of PEC domains into MDPs, introducing 'action-taking situations' to preserve PEC's flexible semantics.

Result: The PEC-MDP framework integrates the tools and algorithms of MDPs into PEC, enabling both temporal reasoning and planning with human-readable outputs.

Conclusion: PEC's functionality is extended through the MDP translation, enabling new applications in planning while preserving its interpretability and narrative reasoning strengths.

Abstract: Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) is a logical framework for reasoning about
actions and their effects in uncertain environments, which enables the
representation of probabilistic narratives and computation of temporal
projections. The PEC formalism offers significant advantages in
interpretability and expressiveness for narrative reasoning. However, it lacks
mechanisms for goal-directed reasoning. This paper bridges this gap by
developing a formal translation of PEC domains into Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs), introducing the concept of "action-taking situations" to preserve PEC's
flexible action semantics. The resulting PEC-MDP formalism enables the
extensive collection of algorithms and theoretical tools developed for MDPs to
be applied to PEC's interpretable narrative domains. We demonstrate how the
translation supports both temporal reasoning tasks and objective-driven
planning, with methods for mapping learned policies back into human-readable
PEC representations, maintaining interpretability while extending PEC's
capabilities.

*Roger Xavier Lera-Leri,Filippo Bistaffa,Athina Georgara,Juan Antonio Rodriguez-Aguilar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces X-MILP, a method for explaining solutions to MILP problems through constraint reasoning and graph visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve trustworthy AI by creating contrastive explanations for solutions to MILPs, addressing user concerns in decision-making processes.

Method: X-MILP uses constraint reasoning to encode user queries as constraints, computes the Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) to identify reasons, and visualizes them as a graph for interpretability.

Result: The method is applied to standard optimization problems to assess the effort required to generate explanations.

Conclusion: X-MILP provides a structured, domain-agnostic framework for explaining MILP solutions, enhancing user understanding and trust in AI systems.

Abstract: Following the recent push for trustworthy AI, there has been an increasing
interest in developing contrastive explanation techniques for optimisation,
especially concerning the solution of specific decision-making processes
formalised as MILPs. Along these lines, we propose X-MILP, a domain-agnostic
approach for building contrastive explanations for MILPs based on constraint
reasoning techniques. First, we show how to encode the queries a user makes
about the solution of an MILP problem as additional constraints. Then, we
determine the reasons that constitute the answer to the user's query by
computing the Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) of the newly obtained set
of constraints. Finally, we represent our explanation as a "graph of reasons"
constructed from the IIS, which helps the user understand the structure among
the reasons that answer their query. We test our method on instances of
well-known optimisation problems to evaluate the empirical hardness of
computing explanations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores traffic flow prediction models using MLR and RF algorithms on California Highway 78 data, determining optimal performance with 10-minute intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address global traffic congestion problems by leveraging machine learning for effective traffic flow predictions.

Method: 30-second interval traffic data analyzed with MLR and RF algorithms over a five-month period, using performance metrics like R^2, MAE, and RMSE.

Result: MLR and RF models showed optimal performance by employing a 10-minute data collection interval.

Conclusion: Results suggest that AI-based models such as MLR and RF can be key to improving traffic management and solving congestion issues.

Abstract: The study "Prediction of Highway Traffic Flow Based on Artificial
Intelligence Algorithms Using California Traffic Data" presents a machine
learning-based traffic flow prediction model to address global traffic
congestion issues. The research utilized 30-second interval traffic data from
California Highway 78 over a five-month period from July to November 2022,
analyzing a 7.24 km westbound section connecting "Melrose Dr" and "El-Camino
Real" in the San Diego area. The study employed Multiple Linear Regression
(MLR) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms, analyzing data collection intervals
ranging from 30 seconds to 15 minutes. Using R^2, MAE, and RMSE as performance
metrics, the analysis revealed that both MLR and RF models performed optimally
with 10-minute data collection intervals. These findings are expected to
contribute to future traffic congestion solutions and efficient traffic
management.

### [17] [From Roots to Rewards: Dynamic Tree Reasoning with RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13142)
*Ahmed Bahloul,Simon Malberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic reinforcement learning framework to enhance tree-structured reasoning by incrementally building reasoning trees and selecting actions based on confidence estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Probabilistic Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree) frameworks struggle with static tree structures and computational inefficiencies, limiting their adaptability and resource optimization.

Method: The authors propose a dynamic reinforcement learning framework that incrementally constructs reasoning trees, leveraging real-time confidence estimates to optimize action selection and adapt to intermediate results.

Result: The proposed framework improves solution quality and computational efficiency by selectively expanding reasoning trees and better allocating resources.

Conclusion: This work introduces a dynamic approach to tree-structured reasoning, combining the reliability of probabilistic methods with the adaptability needed for effective real-world question answering systems.

Abstract: Modern language models address complex questions through chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al.,
2021), yet struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration.
Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic
Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues
by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers
through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge
(Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two
key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial
construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and
(2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution
strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic
reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms
tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally
constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while
learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or
aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving
both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion
and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for
treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic
frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering
systems.

### [18] [Black Box Deployed -- Functional Criteria for Artificial Moral Agents in the LLM Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13175)
*Matthew E. Brophy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new set of ten functional criteria for evaluating large language model-based artificial moral agents, addressing concerns about their opaque internal workings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ethical frameworks for artificial moral agents are insufficient for evaluating the opaque and stochastic nature of large language models.

Method: The authors propose and define ten functional criteria that specifically address the challenges posed by large language models in moral evaluation, illustrated through hypothetical scenarios.

Result: The criteria offer a pragmatic and philosophically grounded approach to guide moral evaluation of LLM-based systems like autonomous public buses, ensuring societal alignment.

Conclusion: By revising moral evaluation criteria to suit LLMs' unique properties, this paper provides a framework to ensure their ethical alignment and practical societal benefits.

Abstract: The advancement of powerful yet opaque large language models (LLMs)
necessitates a fundamental revision of the philosophical criteria used to
evaluate artificial moral agents (AMAs). Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the
assumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their
stochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that
traditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this
mismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper
proffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based
artificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative
integrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness,
corrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral
imagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term "SMA-LLS" (Simulating
Moral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater
alignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We
illustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous
public bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally
salient contexts.

*Besik Dundua,Temur Kutsia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores combining higher-order patterns and fuzzy logic, proposing a unification algorithm based on minimum T-norm for reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve decision-making tasks that involve abstract functions and predicates where exact matches are unnecessary, leveraging the strengths of higher-order theories and fuzzy logic.

Method: Developed a unification algorithm for higher-order patterns using similarity relations based on minimum T-norm. The algorithm's properties like termination, soundness, and completeness are proven.

Result: The algorithm computes a most general unifier with the highest degree of approximation for unifiable terms, and the problem is unitary.

Conclusion: The integration of higher-order patterns with fuzzy logic results in an efficient computational formalism for dealing with imprecisions in reasoning tasks, supported by sound theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: The combination of higher-order theories and fuzzy logic can be useful in
decision-making tasks that involve reasoning across abstract functions and
predicates, where exact matches are often rare or unnecessary. Developing
efficient reasoning and computational techniques for such a combined formalism
presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we adopt a more
straightforward approach aiming at integrating two well-established and
computationally well-behaved components: higher-order patterns on one side and
fuzzy equivalences expressed through similarity relations based on minimum
T-norm on the other. We propose a unification algorithm for higher-order
patterns modulo these similarity relations and prove its termination,
soundness, and completeness. This unification problem, like its crisp
counterpart, is unitary. The algorithm computes a most general unifier with the
highest degree of approximation when the given terms are unifiable.

### [20] [The Generative Energy Arena (GEA): Incorporating Energy Awareness in Large Language Model (LLM) Human Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13302)
*Carlos Arriaga,Gonzalo Martínez,Eneko Sendin,Javier Conde,Pedro Reviriego*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces GEA, a public evaluation platform for large language models (LLMs) where users consider energy consumption in addition to response quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for LLMs suffer from scalability issues and weak correlation with human preferences, while energy consumption remains underexplored in these evaluations.

Method: GEA offers users a platform to compare model responses while being informed about the energy consumption of the models, incorporating this data into the ranking process.

Result: Preliminary results show that users tend to favor smaller, more energy-efficient models, indicating that energy awareness significantly impacts model selection.

Conclusion: Energy efficiency plays an important role in user preferences, suggesting that the cost and complexity of larger models do not always justify their deployment in general usage scenarios.

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models is a complex task, in which several
approaches have been proposed. The most common is the use of automated
benchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different
topics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most
concerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is
to have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a
large and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and
costly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators
and having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is
the use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can
freely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.
The results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important
aspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how
energy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of
interest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena
that incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the
evaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,
showing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy
consumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests
that for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more
complex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived
quality of the responses that justifies their use.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FormulaOne benchmark tests AI on graph theory, logic, and algorithms, revealing their limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the true capabilities of frontier AI in solving real-life, challenging research problems.

Method: Development of FormulaOne, comprising complex problems grounded in MSO logic; includes commercial interest scenarios and theoretical computer science implications.

Result: State-of-the-art models like OpenAI's o3 perform poorly, solving less than 1% of FormulaOne tasks.

Conclusion: AI models are far from expert-level understanding, requiring more advancements in reasoning and problem-solving capabilities.

Abstract: Frontier AI models demonstrate formidable breadth of knowledge. But how close
are they to true human -- or superhuman -- expertise? Genuine experts can
tackle the hardest problems and push the boundaries of scientific
understanding. To illuminate the limits of frontier model capabilities, we turn
away from contrived competitive programming puzzles, and instead focus on
real-life research problems.
  We construct FormulaOne, a benchmark that lies at the intersection of graph
theory, logic, and algorithms, all well within the training distribution of
frontier models. Our problems are incredibly demanding, requiring an array of
reasoning steps. The dataset has three key properties. First, it is of
commercial interest and relates to practical large-scale optimisation problems,
such as those arising in routing, scheduling, and network design. Second, it is
generated from the highly expressive framework of Monadic Second-Order (MSO)
logic on graphs, paving the way toward automatic problem generation at scale;
ideal for building RL environments. Third, many of our problems are intimately
related to the frontier of theoretical computer science, and to central
conjectures therein, such as the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). As
such, any significant algorithmic progress on our dataset, beyond known
results, could carry profound theoretical implications.
  Remarkably, state-of-the-art models like OpenAI's o3 fail entirely on
FormulaOne, solving less than 1% of the questions, even when given 10 attempts
and explanatory fewshot examples -- highlighting how far they remain from
expert-level understanding in some domains. To support further research, we
additionally curate FormulaOne-Warmup, offering a set of simpler tasks, from
the same distribution. We release the full corpus along with a comprehensive
evaluation framework.

*Petr Kourzanov,Anmol*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper explores how to enhance the modularity of the RISC-V ISA through an experiment called Modular SAIL, enabling compositionality in the development flow, including emulation, simulation, and verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to leverage the modularity of the RISC-V ISA beyond specification, addressing challenges in compositionality in emulation, simulation, and verification.

Method: The authors propose Modular SAIL, a modification to the SAIL-RISCV golden model and emulator flow, introducing modular functionality and supporting both static and dynamic binding.

Result: The study demonstrated the feasibility of modularity at the emulator level, showing that the new approach has the same functional behavior as the original RISC-V ISS.

Conclusion: Modularizing the SAIL-RISCV model is achievable and provides benefits in supporting compositionality at various levels of the RISC-V development flow.

Abstract: In order to truly benefit from RISC-V ISA modularity, the community has to
address the issue of compositionality, going beyond modules at the
specification level covering larger subsets of the RISC-V development flow
including emulation, simulation and verification. In this paper we introduce
modular SAIL, an experiment to inject compositionality into the SAIL-RISCV
golden model. We show that it is, in principle, not difficult to adapt the
SAIL-RISCV flow (and ideally the SAIL compiler itself) to support modules at
the emulator level. We back our findings by a comparative study of the
resulting pluggable emulator's performance using both static and dynamic
binding, which both exhibit same functional behavior as the original monolithic
emulator (aka RISC-V ISS).

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA) architecture to efficiently deploy transformer models on low-power edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers, though powerful, are computationally demanding and face challenges in deployment on energy-constrained edge devices.

Method: A CGRA architecture featuring a 4x4 array of Processing Elements and 4x2 Memory Operation Blocks is designed for efficient parallel computation and optimized memory operations.

Result: The architecture achieves reduced power consumption and latency through its efficient dataflow and switchless mesh torus interconnect network.

Conclusion: This CGRA design enables scalable and efficient deployment of transformer models on energy-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized deep learning with applications in natural
language processing, computer vision, and beyond. However, their computational
demands make it challenging to deploy them on low-power edge devices. This
paper introduces an ultra-low-power, Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA)
architecture specifically designed to accelerate General Matrix Multiplication
(GEMM) operations in transformer models tailored for the energy and resource
constraints of edge applications. The proposed architecture integrates a 4 x 4
array of Processing Elements (PEs) for efficient parallel computation and
dedicated 4 x 2 Memory Operation Blocks (MOBs) for optimized LOAD/STORE
operations, reducing memory bandwidth demands and enhancing data reuse. A
switchless mesh torus interconnect network further minimizes power and latency
by enabling direct communication between PEs and MOBs, eliminating the need for
centralized switching. Through its heterogeneous array design and efficient
dataflow, this CGRA architecture addresses the unique computational needs of
transformers, offering a scalable pathway to deploy sophisticated machine
learning models on edge devices.

Motivation: Counterfeit ICs are increasingly prevalent and can disrupt electronics education, providing an opportunity to use this challenge to teach critical skills.

Method: The authors conducted a case study where students diagnosed and troubleshot counterfeit TL074 chips in a hands-on manner.

Conclusion: The issue of counterfeit components can be transformed into an educational opportunity to enhance students’ technical and practical engineering skills.

Abstract: This work-in-progress paper presents a case study in which counterfeit TL074
operational amplifiers, discovered in a junior level electronics course, became
the basis for a hands on learning experience. Counterfeit integrated circuits
(IC) are increasingly common, posing a significant threat to the integrity of

*Lionel Wong,Katherine M. Collins,Lance Ying,Cedegao E. Zhang,Adrian Weller,Tobias Gersternberg,Timothy O'Donnell,Alexander K. Lew,Jacob D. Andreas,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Tyler Brooke-Wilson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Model Synthesis Architecture (MSA) combining language models and probabilistic programs to mimic human reasoning in novel situations, outperforming language model-only baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and replicate how humans reason over globally relevant variables in novel situations by leveraging a mix of distributed and symbolic knowledge representations.

Method: The authors developed a Model Synthesis Architecture (MSA) that integrates language models for relevance-based retrieval and model synthesis, alongside probabilistic programs for constructing coherent mental models. They evaluated it on a bespoke reasoning dataset termed the 'Model Olympics' domain.

Result: The MSA more accurately captured human-like judgments compared to language model-only baselines, both under direct and chain-of-thought setups for reasoning.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that hybrid architectures like the MSA can effectively replicate human reasoning in open-ended tasks, offering new pathways to understanding cognitive processes.

Abstract: When faced with novel situations, people are able to marshal relevant
considerations from a wide range of background knowledge and put these to use
in inferences and predictions. What permits us to draw in globally relevant
information and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that
people use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to
construct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a
computational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''
(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval
and model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent
world models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel
reasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of
sports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning
by requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;
(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in
light of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA
approach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,
under both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports
model synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way
that mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over
globally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating
human reasoning in open-ended domains.

*Michael A. Lepori,Jennifer Hu,Ishita Dasgupta,Roma Patel,Thomas Serre,Ellie Pavlick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how language models (LMs) categorize sentences based on modality (e.g., possible, impossible, nonsensical) and introduces 'modal difference vectors' to evaluate their capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Given the importance of modality categorization in tasks like question answering and creative writing, and prior studies questioning LMs' abilities in this area, this paper aims to examine whether LMs can effectively discern different modal categories.

Method: The authors identify linear representations called modal difference vectors within various LMs and analyze their effectiveness in distinguishing between modal categories. They also study the emergence of these vectors during model training and correlate them with human semantic judgments.

Result: The study finds that LMs possess undetected capabilities for reliable modal categorization. Modal difference vectors emerge in a consistent way as models become more competent and align well with fine-grained human categorical behavior.

Conclusion: LMs have a deeper understanding of modal categories than suggested in earlier studies, and modal difference vectors offer a promising framework to study both machine and human modal categorization processes.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question
answering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these
tasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,
whether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely
nonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the
ability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,
2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that
discriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal
difference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have
access to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously
reported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a
consistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,
layers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors
identified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human
categorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human
participants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by
correlating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'
ratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM
modal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with
the potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.

Motivation: To address the lack of resources and tools for the vulnerable Chechen language by developing a multilingual translation model.

Method: The researchers fine-tuned the NLLB-200 multilingual translation system and trained it on a collected parallel dataset for Chechen and Russian.

Result: The model achieved BLEU and ChrF++ scores of 8.34 / 34.69 (Russian to Chechen) and 20.89 / 44.55 (Chechen to Russian).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses how advanced NLP models, particularly BioClinicalBERT, can efficiently classify specific drug involvement from coroner reports, enabling faster and more accurate overdose surveillance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drug-related deaths in the U.S. are rising, driven by fentanyl. Current methods of surveillance rely on ICD-10 coding, which is slow and causes data loss.

Method: The study used a dataset of 35,433 death records from 2020 for training/testing and validated results on an external dataset of 3,335 records from 2023-2024. Models tested included classic classifiers, encoder-only models like BERT and BioClinicalBERT, and decoder-only large language models.

Result: Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models showed near-perfect performance (macro F1 >=0.998 internally, 0.966 externally), outperforming other methods.

Conclusion: BioClinicalBERT models provide a highly accurate and scalable approach to classify overdose deaths from free-text, accelerating workflows and improving surveillance systems.

Abstract: The rising rate of drug-related deaths in the United States, largely driven
by fentanyl, requires timely and accurate surveillance. However, critical
overdose data are often buried in free-text coroner reports, leading to delays
and information loss when coded into ICD (International Classification of
Disease)-10 classifications. Natural language processing (NLP) models may
automate and enhance overdose surveillance, but prior applications have been
limited. A dataset of 35,433 death records from multiple U.S. jurisdictions in
2020 was used for model training and internal testing. External validation was
conducted using a novel separate dataset of 3,335 records from 2023-2024.
Multiple NLP approaches were evaluated for classifying specific drug
involvement from unstructured death certificate text. These included
traditional single- and multi-label classifiers, as well as fine-tuned
encoder-only language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) and BioClinicalBERT, and contemporary decoder-only large
language models such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3. Model performance was assessed
using macro-averaged F1 scores, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to
quantify uncertainty. Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models achieved near-perfect
performance, with macro F1 scores >=0.998 on the internal test set. External
validation confirmed robustness (macro F1=0.966), outperforming conventional
machine learning, general-domain BERT models, and various decoder-only large
language models. NLP models, particularly fine-tuned clinical variants like
BioClinicalBERT, offer a highly accurate and scalable solution for overdose
death classification from free-text reports. These methods can significantly
accelerate surveillance workflows, overcoming the limitations of manual ICD-10
coding and supporting near real-time detection of emerging substance use
trends.

TL;DR: AdaptiSent is a framework for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) that improves sentiment and aspect extraction by using adaptive cross-modal attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance sentiment classification and aspect term extraction by effectively leveraging both textual and visual information.

Method: Introduces adaptive cross-modal attention mechanisms, dynamic modality weighting, and context-adaptive attention to analyze the interaction between text and images.

Result: AdaptiSent outperformed traditional and multimodal baselines in precision, recall, and F1 scores, particularly excelling in identifying nuanced inter-modal relationships.

Conclusion: The framework sets a new standard for MABSA, demonstrating superior performance and better understanding of complex multimodal data.

Abstract: We introduce AdaptiSent, a new framework for Multimodal Aspect-Based
Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) that uses adaptive cross-modal attention mechanisms
to improve sentiment classification and aspect term extraction from both text
and images. Our model integrates dynamic modality weighting and
context-adaptive attention, enhancing the extraction of sentiment and
aspect-related information by focusing on how textual cues and visual context
interact. We tested our approach against several baselines, including
traditional text-based models and other multimodal methods. Results from
standard Twitter datasets show that AdaptiSent surpasses existing models in
precision, recall, and F1 score, and is particularly effective in identifying
nuanced inter-modal relationships that are crucial for accurate sentiment and
aspect term extraction. This effectiveness comes from the model's ability to
adjust its focus dynamically based on the context's relevance, improving the
depth and accuracy of sentiment analysis across various multimodal data sets.
AdaptiSent sets a new standard for MABSA, significantly outperforming current
methods, especially in understanding complex multimodal information.

TL;DR: This paper introduces AudioJudge, a unified framework for audio evaluation using Large Audio Models (LAMs) with improved correlation to human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech evaluation methods struggle with creating specialized systems for individual audio aspects and poor correlation to human judgment.

Method: The study explores audio evaluation tasks using LAMs, employing prompt engineering strategies like audio concatenation and in-context learning. A multi-aspect ensemble approach is used for comprehensive evaluation.

Result: AudioJudge achieves up to 0.91 Spearman correlation with human preferences and demonstrates robustness but faces challenges like verbosity and positional biases.

Conclusion: AudioJudge offers a promising unified solution for multi-aspect speech evaluation, but challenges like biases need further mitigation.

Abstract: Current speech evaluation suffers from two critical limitations: the need and
difficulty of designing specialized systems targeting individual audio
characteristics, and poor correlation between automatic evaluation methods and
human preferences. This work presents a systematic study of Large Audio Model
(LAM) as a Judge, AudioJudge, investigating whether it can provide a unified
evaluation framework that addresses both challenges. We systematically explore
AudioJudge across audio characteristic detection tasks, including
pronunciation, speaking rate, speaker identification and speech quality, and
system-level human preference simulation for automated benchmarking. We
investigate different prompt engineering strategies, finding that audio
concatenation combined with in-context learning significantly improves
performance across both audio characteristic detection and human preference
simulation tasks. We further introduce a multi-aspect ensemble AudioJudge to
enable general-purpose multi-aspect audio evaluation. This method decomposes
speech assessment into specialized judges for lexical content, speech quality,
and paralinguistic features, achieving up to 0.91 Spearman correlation with
human preferences on our system ranking benchmark. Robustness analysis reveals
that while LAMs maintain strong performance under acoustic noise, they exhibit
significant verbosity and positional biases that require careful mitigation.

Motivation: Subword tokenizers, commonly used with language models, are rigid and ineffective for out-of-distribution domains, languages, or scripts, causing inefficient tokenization and reduced downstream performance.

Method: The authors introduce byte-level models with learnable tokenizers. FLEXITOKENS employs a simplified training objective for predicting input byte boundaries, allowing adaptive tokenization without enforcing a fixed compression rate.

Result: FLEXITOKENS reduces token over-fragmentation and improves downstream task performance by up to 10%, shown across various multilingual benchmarks, tasks, and domains.

Conclusion: Adaptive tokenization via FLEXITOKENS improves language model performance in diverse conditions, overcoming the rigidity of traditional subword tokenization methods.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are challenging to adapt to new data distributions by
simple finetuning. This is due to the rigidity of their subword tokenizers,
which typically remain unchanged during adaptation. This inflexibility often
leads to inefficient tokenization, causing overfragmentation of
out-of-distribution domains, unseen languages, or scripts. In this work, we
develop byte-level LMs with learnable tokenizers to make tokenization adaptive.
Our models include a submodule that learns to predict boundaries between the
input byte sequence, encoding it into variable-length segments. Existing
tokenizer-free methods train this boundary predictor using an auxiliary loss
that enforces a fixed compression rate across the training corpus, introducing
a new kind of rigidity. We propose FLEXITOKENS, a simplified training objective
that enables significantly greater flexibility during adaptation. Evaluating
across multiple multilingual benchmarks, morphologically diverse tasks, and
domains, we demonstrate that FLEXITOKENS consistently reduces token
over-fragmentation and achieves up to 10\% improvements on downstream task
performance compared to subword and other gradient-based tokenizers. Code and
data for our experiments will be released at

### [32] [TransEvalnia: Reasoning-based Evaluation and Ranking of Translations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12724)
*Richard Sproat,Tianyu Zhao,Llion Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TransEvalnia, a translation evaluation and ranking system that leverages reasoning and fine-grained metrics to outperform existing state-of-the-art methods and yield human-acceptable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for an improved translation evaluation system that aligns well with both human assessments and multidimensional quality metrics, addressing shortcomings in existing methods such as position bias.

Method: The authors utilize LLMs like Claude-3.5-Sonnet and Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct for a prompting-based system, providing numerical scores across various dimensions and addressing position bias through systematic adjustments.

Result: TransEvalnia demonstrated superior performance compared to MT-Ranker in terms of both accuracy and human correlation across different language pairs. Position bias was identified and mitigated.

Conclusion: TransEvalnia is a promising advancement in translation evaluation, combining reasoning, fine-grained metrics, and strong agreement with human assessments, with publicly available data and code for further research.

Abstract: We present TransEvalnia, a prompting-based translation evaluation and ranking
system that uses reasoning in performing its evaluations and ranking. This
system presents fine-grained evaluations based on a subset of the
Multidimensional Quality Metrics (https://themqm.org/), returns an assessment
of which translation it deems the best, and provides numerical scores for the
various dimensions and for the overall translation. We show that TransEvalnia
performs as well as or better than the state-of-the-art MT-Ranker (Moosa et al.
2024) on our own English-Japanese data as well as several language pairs from
various WMT shared tasks. Using Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct as the evaluation LLMs, we show that the evaluations
returned are deemed highly acceptable to human raters, and that the scores
assigned to the translations by Sonnet, as well as other LLMs, correlate well
with scores assigned by the human raters. We also note the sensitivity of our
system -- as well as MT-Ranker -- to the order in which the translations are
presented, and we propose methods to address this position bias. All data,
including the system's evaluation and reasoning, human assessments, as well as
code is released.

*Fuya Nakamori,Yin Jou Huang,Fei Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for switching strategies in Werewolf game agents based on player attitudes and game context, enabling adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous Werewolf agents lacked adaptability due to reliance on fixed or implicit strategies, which could not respond to dynamic situations.

Method: The proposed approach explicitly selects a suitable strategy using game context data and assessments of other players' roles.

Result: The adaptability of strategy-switching agents was validated through comparisons with baseline agents employing fixed or implicit strategies.

Conclusion: Explicit strategy selection improves Werewolf agent performance by allowing them to adapt to dynamic gaming environments effectively.

Abstract: This study proposes a method to improve the performance of Werewolf agents by
switching between predefined strategies based on the attitudes of other players
and the context of conversations. While prior works of Werewolf agents using
prompt engineering have employed methods where effective strategies are
implicitly defined, they cannot adapt to changing situations. In this research,
we propose a method that explicitly selects an appropriate strategy based on
the game context and the estimated roles of other players. We compare the
strategy adaptation Werewolf agents with baseline agents using implicit or
fixed strategies and verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

### [34] [Logit Arithmetic Elicits Long Reasoning Capabilities Without Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12759)
*Yunxiang Zhang,Muhammad Khalifa,Lechen Zhang,Xin Liu,Ayoung Lee,Xinliang Frederick Zhang,Farima Fatahi Bayat,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces "ThinkLogit," a decoding-time method to improve long reasoning in large language models (LLMs) using a smaller model as guider, without additional training. Further enhancement is achieved through a trained version, "ThinkLogit-DPO."


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models are capable of complex reasoning but often require extra training to fully unlock these abilities. The motivation is to develop a computationally efficient approach to elicit such reasoning without additional training.

Method: The authors propose "ThinkLogit," a decoding-time method leveraging logit arithmetic and employing smaller guiding models to enhance the reasoning of large LMs. They introduce ThinkLogit-DPO, where the guider model is further tuned using preference optimization on correct/incorrect reasoning pairs.

Result: The paper reports a 26% improvement in pass@1 for ThinkLogit and a 29% improvement for ThinkLogit-DPO on four mathematical datasets. ThinkLogit also demonstrated a relative 13% improvement through transferring skills learned via reinforcement learning, all tested on the Qwen2.5-32B model with guidance from a smaller R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model.

Conclusion: The study provides a novel and efficient approach to elicit and boost long reasoning in large LMs, leveraging smaller guiding models and minimal training or resource requirements.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) can do complex reasoning via long
chain-of-thought (CoT) involving cognitive strategies such as backtracking and
self-correction. Recent studies suggest that some models inherently possess
these long reasoning abilities, which may be unlocked via extra training. Our
work first investigates whether we can elicit such behavior without any
training. To this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which
utilizes logits arithmetic (Liu et al., 2024) to tune a target large LM for
long reasoning using a substantially smaller model as guider. We then show that
we can further boost performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model -- a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our
experiments demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative
improvement in pass@1 by 26% and 29%, respectively, over four mathematical
datasets using the Qwen2.5-32B when guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B -- a model
21x smaller. Lastly, we show that ThinkLogit can transfer long reasoning skills
acquired through reinforcement learning, improving pass@1 by 13% relative
compared to the Qwen2.5-32B base model. Our work presents a
computationally-efficient method to elicit long reasoning in large models with
minimal or no additional training.

### [35] [Synergy: End-to-end Concept Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12769)
*Keli Zheng,Zerong Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Synergy, a tokenizer-free language model that operates on byte-level input and learns to tokenize spontaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome bottlenecks caused by traditional tokenization processes and explore tokenizer-free language model architectures.

Method: They developed Synergy, trained as a byte-level language model, with a focus on end-to-end abstraction using a learned routing mechanism.

Result: Synergy learns to tokenize bytes spontaneously, uses fewer tokens than BBPE tokenizers, matches performance, and shows position-independent concepts when positional encodings are removed.

Conclusion: Tokenizer-free architectures are feasible and can lead to more robust and flexible language modeling pipelines.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Synergy, a language model that bridges different
levels of abstraction in an end-to-end fashion through a learned routing
mechanism. Focusing on low-level linguistic abstraction, we trained our model
as a byte-level language model. Our model spontaneously learns to tokenize
bytes, producing fewer concept tokens than Byte-level Byte Pair Encoder (BBPE)
tokenizers while keeping comparable performance. By comparing with Llama3, we
observed an advantage of Synergy under the same model scale and training
dataset size. Further studies show that the middle part (the higher abstraction
part) of our model performs better when positional encodings are removed,
suggesting the emergence of position-independent concepts. These findings
demonstrate the feasibility of tokenizer-free architectures, paving the way for
more robust and flexible pipelines.

### [36] [Learning Robust Negation Text Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12782)
*Thinh Hung Truong,Karin Verspoor,Trevor Cohn,Timothy Baldwin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of improving the handling of negation by text encoders and proposes a contrastive learning approach to enhance negation robustness. Results show significant improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Negation semantics remain poorly captured by text encoders, limiting performance in applications that rely on contextualized text embeddings.

Method: The authors propose a strategy to improve text encoders by distilling negation examples from large language models and finetuning a BERT-based encoder using contrastive learning.

Result: Finetuned BERT-based models demonstrated significant improvement in understanding negation while maintaining competitiveness on general benchmarks.

Conclusion: Their approach enhances text encoders' robustness to negation while also being adaptable to improve negation handling in large language models.

Abstract: Despite rapid adoption of autoregressive large language models, smaller text
encoders still play an important role in text understanding tasks that require
rich contextualized representations. Negation is an important semantic function
that is still not properly captured by such methods, affecting many downstream
applications relying on text embeddings. We propose a strategy to improve
negation robustness of text encoders, by distilling data from large language
models using diverse patterns of negation and hedging. We adopt a standard
contrastive learning strategy to finetune a strong BERT-based model, and
observe large improvement in negation understanding capabilities while
maintaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. In addition, we also
show that our method can be adapted to LLMs, leading to improved performance on
negation benchmarks.

### [37] [Large Language Models' Internal Perception of Symbolic Music](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12808)
*Andrew Shin,Kunitake Kaneko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how large language models (LLMs) understand and generate symbolic music by creating and analyzing a dataset of LLM-generated MIDI files, showing that LLMs can infer basic musical structures but have limitations due to lacking explicit musical training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the ability of large language models to represent and generate symbolic music, given their success in language, coding, and mathematics.

Method: The study generates symbolic music data using textual prompts for LLMs, creates a MIDI dataset, trains neural networks on this dataset, and evaluates their performance in classification and melody completion tasks compared to established models.

Result: LLMs demonstrate the ability to infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text, but their lack of explicit musical training introduces limitations.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in encoding musical patterns and generating symbolic music, but their capabilities are constrained without explicit musical input or specialized training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at modeling relationships between strings
in natural language and have shown promise in extending to other symbolic
domains like coding or mathematics. However, the extent to which they
implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates
how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from
textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating
their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of
LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then
train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform
genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their
performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can
infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text,
highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and
their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on
their generative capabilities for symbolic music.

### [38] [Are Knowledge and Reference in Multilingual Language Models Cross-Lingually Consistent?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12838)
*Xi Ai,Mahardika Krisna Ihsani,Min-Yen Kan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines cross-lingual consistency for factual knowledge in multilingual models, and identifies factors affecting consistency and promising improvement strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand, analyze, and interpret the cross-lingual consistency of factual knowledge in multilingual models, which is crucial for ensuring transferability, factuality, and performance parity across languages.

Method: The authors used code-mixed coreferential statements to examine cross-lingual knowledge consistency and applied interpretability approaches to analyze model behavior. They also evaluated multilingual training strategies like code-switching and cross-lingual word alignment.

Result: Multilingual models display varying degrees of cross-lingual consistency influenced by language families, linguistic factors, and layers within the model. Strategies like code-switching and cross-lingual alignment showed the biggest improvement in consistency.

Conclusion: Code-switching training and cross-lingual alignment supervision are effective methods for enhancing both multilingual performance and cross-lingual consistency.

Abstract: Cross-lingual consistency should be considered to assess cross-lingual
transferability, maintain the factuality of the model knowledge across
languages, and preserve the parity of language model performance. We are thus
interested in analyzing, evaluating, and interpreting cross-lingual consistency
for factual knowledge. We examine code-mixed coreferential statements conveyed
identical knowledge across languages to study cross-lingual knowledge
consistency. We use some interpretability approaches to analyze the behavior of
a model in cross-lingual contexts, discovering that multilingual models show
different levels of consistency, subject to language families, linguistic
factors, and a bottleneck in cross-lingual consistency on a particular layer.
In addition, we evaluate common strategies aimed at improving multilingual
performance to observe whether these strategies can improve knowledge
consistency at the same time. While knowledge is not cross-lingual consistency
in many cases, code-switching training and cross-lingual word alignment
objectives show the most promising results, emphasizing the noteworthiness of
cross-lingual alignment supervision and code-switching training for both
multilingual performance and cross-lingual consistency enhancement.

*Yihong Wang,Zhonglin Jiang,Ningyuan Xi,Yue Zhao,Qingqing Gu,Xiyuan Chen,Hao Wu,Sheng Xu,Hange Zhou,Yong Chen,Luo Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces hierarchical decoding for language models by adapting intermediate layers for simultaneous text decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by humans' hierarchical thinking, the paper seeks to enhance language model architectures using multi-layer simultaneous decoding.

Method: The authors adapt a pretrained language model by copying the language heads of its last layer to intermediate layers, which are fine-tuned for specific tasks.

Result: Experiments demonstrate these modified layers effectively generate meaningful content, achieving state-of-the-art results on hierarchical tasks.

Conclusion: The study hints at the feasibility of creating generalized hierarchical reasoners through scratch pretraining.

Abstract: Decoder-only language models, such as GPT and LLaMA, generally decode on the
last layer. Motivated by human's hierarchical thinking capability, we propose
that a hierarchical decoder architecture could be built with different layers
decoding texts simultaneously. Due to limited time and computationally
resources, we choose to adapt a pretrained language model into this form of
hierarchical decoder. Language heads of the last layer are copied to different
selected intermediate layers, and fine-tuned with different task inputs. By
thorough experiments, we validate that these selective intermediate layers
could be adapted to speak meaningful and reasonable contents, and this paradigm
of hierarchical decoder can obtain state-of-the-art performances on multiple
tasks such as hierarchical text classification, classification-guided
generation, and hierarchical text generation. This study suggests the
possibility of a generalized hierarchical reasoner, pretraining from scratch.

TL;DR: The paper describes an approach to answer Spanish table-based questions using Python code generation with LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the IberLEF 2025 Task PRESTA, which involves answering questions based on tables in Spanish.

Method: The approach involves analyzing table content, selecting useful columns, generating natural language instructions, translating them into Python code, and handling errors. Open-source LLMs and optimized prompts are used.

Result: The proposed method achieved an accuracy score of 85% on the task.

Conclusion: The Python code generation with LLMs approach proves effective for processing and answering questions about Spanish tables.

Abstract: This paper presents our approach for the IberLEF 2025 Task PRESTA: Preguntas
y Respuestas sobre Tablas en Espa\~nol (Questions and Answers about Tables in
Spanish). Our solution obtains answers to the questions by implementing Python
code generation with LLMs that is used to filter and process the table. This
solution evolves from the MRT implementation for the Semeval 2025 related task.
The process consists of multiple steps: analyzing and understanding the content
of the table, selecting the useful columns, generating instructions in natural
language, translating these instructions to code, running it, and handling
potential errors or exceptions. These steps use open-source LLMs and
fine-grained optimized prompts for each step. With this approach, we achieved
an accuracy score of 85\% in the task.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a UML-based formal model for attack scenarios to automate cybersecurity processes, focusing on analysis and training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations face evolving threats, necessitating automated cybersecurity processes that require formalized input data.

Method: The authors propose a formal model using UML class diagrams to represent attack context and scenarios, enabling its integration into automation workflows.

Result: The model supports upstream attack analysis and automates the generation of attack scripts for cybersecurity training.

Conclusion: Formalizing attack scenarios using UML can streamline cybersecurity automation and improve both analysis and training processes.

Abstract: Organizations face an ever-changing threat landscape. They must continuously
dedicate significant efforts to protect their assets, making their adoption of
increased cybersecurity automation inevitable. However, process automation
requires formalization of input data. Through this paper, we address this need
for processes that use attack scenarios as input. Among these processes, one
can mention both the generation of scripts for attack simulation and training
purposes, as well as the analysis of attacks. Therefore, the paper's main
research contribution is a novel formal model that encompasses the attack's
context description and its scenario. It is abstracted using UML class model.
Once the description of our model done, we will show how it could serve an
upstream attack analysis process. We will show also its use for an automatic
generation of attack scripts in the context of cybersecurity training. These
two uses cases constitute the second contribution of this present research
work.

*Marc Brinner,Sina Zarriess*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemCSE is an unsupervised method that leverages LLM-based summaries to create better semantic embeddings for scientific texts, outperforming traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for scientific text embedding, like citation-based approaches, fail to capture semantic similarity effectively.

Method: SemCSE uses LLM-generated summaries and contrastive learning to train models for positioning semantically similar texts closer in the embedding space.

Result: A novel benchmark validates the semantic focus, and SemCSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SciRepEval benchmark among models of similar size.

Conclusion: SemCSE improves encoding semantic content for scientific texts and sets a new standard with a semantic-focused training approach.

Abstract: We introduce SemCSE, an unsupervised method for learning semantic embeddings
of scientific texts. Building on recent advances in contrastive learning for
text embeddings, our approach leverages LLM-generated summaries of scientific
abstracts to train a model that positions semantically related summaries closer
together in the embedding space. This resulting objective ensures that the
model captures the true semantic content of a text, in contrast to traditional
citation-based approaches that do not necessarily reflect semantic similarity.
To validate this, we propose a novel benchmark designed to assess a model's
ability to understand and encode the semantic content of scientific texts,
demonstrating that our method enforces a stronger semantic separation within
the embedding space. Additionally, we evaluate SemCSE on the comprehensive
SciRepEval benchmark for scientific text embeddings, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among models of its size, thus highlighting the
benefits of a semantically focused training approach.

*Jaya Caporusso,Matthew Purver,Senja Pollak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This Ph.D. project aims to create a computational framework for identifying self-related aspects in text by developing an ontology, annotated dataset, and evaluating NLP models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the underexploration of the concept of Self—a key construct in fields like cognitive science and phenomenology—in NLP, while also leveraging its connections to psychological and mental health phenomena.

Method: The paper proposes creating an ontology of Self-aspects, annotating a gold-standard dataset, and developing discriminative, generative, and embedding-retrieval NLP models evaluated on criteria like accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency.

Result: Through model evaluation, the approach seeks to identify top-performing models that align with predefined criteria and can be applied in mental health and phenomenology case studies.

Conclusion: This project will enhance NLP’s ability to analyze self-related constructs, bridging interdisciplinary gaps and offering applications in mental health and theoretical domains.

Abstract: This Ph.D. proposal introduces a plan to develop a computational framework to
identify Self-aspects in text. The Self is a multifaceted construct and it is
reflected in language. While it is described across disciplines like cognitive
science and phenomenology, it remains underexplored in natural language
processing (NLP). Many of the aspects of the Self align with psychological and
other well-researched phenomena (e.g., those related to mental health),
highlighting the need for systematic NLP-based analysis. In line with this, we
plan to introduce an ontology of Self-aspects and a gold-standard annotated
dataset. Using this foundation, we will develop and evaluate conventional
discriminative models, generative large language models, and embedding-based
retrieval approaches against four main criteria: interpretability, ground-truth
adherence, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Top-performing models will
be applied in case studies in mental health and empirical phenomenology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study finds that demographic factors of annotators account for only 8% of the variance in sexism detection annotations, with tweet content being the primary influence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand the impact of annotator demographic biases on sexism detection in NLP systems, which is essential for ensuring fairness.

Method: The study uses a Generalized Linear Mixed Model to quantify demographic influence on labeling decisions and evaluates Generative AI (GenAI) with demographic persona prompts as annotators.

Result: Demographic factors contribute minimally, while tweet content is the dominant annotation factor. Persona prompts in Generative AI often fail to align better with human judgments.

Conclusion: Content-driven explanations and robust annotation protocols are more effective for fairness compared to reliance on demographic persona simulation.

Abstract: Understanding the sources of variability in annotations is crucial for
developing fair NLP systems, especially for tasks like sexism detection where
demographic bias is a concern. This study investigates the extent to which
annotator demographic features influence labeling decisions compared to text
content. Using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model, we quantify this inf luence,
finding that while statistically present, demographic factors account for a
minor fraction ( 8%) of the observed variance, with tweet content being the
dominant factor. We then assess the reliability of Generative AI (GenAI) models
as annotators, specifically evaluating if guiding them with demographic
personas improves alignment with human judgments. Our results indicate that
simplistic persona prompting often fails to enhance, and sometimes degrades,
performance compared to baseline models. Furthermore, explainable AI (XAI)
techniques reveal that model predictions rely heavily on content-specific
tokens related to sexism, rather than correlates of demographic
characteristics. We argue that focusing on content-driven explanations and
robust annotation protocols offers a more reliable path towards fairness than
potentially persona simulation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper uses machine learning to examine oral narrative skills in young Afrikaans- and isiXhosa-speaking children and identifies linguistic features predictive of literacy development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the predictors of literacy development by studying oral narrative skills, especially in multilingual contexts.

Method: Machine learning was used to analyze oral narratives of Afrikaans- and isiXhosa-speaking four- and five-year-old children to identify developmental indicators.

Result: Features like lexical diversity and utterance length were reliable predictors of typical development, while articulation rate was less relevant. Specific verbs and auxiliaries correlated with reduced intervention needs.

Conclusion: Oral narrative features reveal both language-specific and shared predictors of narrative proficiency, aiding early assessment in multilingual environments.

Abstract: Oral narrative skills are strong predictors of later literacy development.
This study examines the features of oral narratives from children who were
identified by experts as requiring intervention. Using simple machine learning
methods, we analyse recorded stories from four- and five-year-old Afrikaans-
and isiXhosa-speaking children. Consistent with prior research, we identify
lexical diversity (unique words) and length-based features (mean utterance
length) as indicators of typical development, but features like articulation
rate prove less informative. Despite cross-linguistic variation in
part-of-speech patterns, the use of specific verbs and auxiliaries associated
with goal-directed storytelling is correlated with a reduced likelihood of
requiring intervention. Our analysis of two linguistically distinct languages
reveals both language-specific and shared predictors of narrative proficiency,
with implications for early assessment in multilingual contexts.

*Jisoo Lee,Raeyoung Chang,Dongwook Kwon,Harmanpreet Singh,Nikhil Verma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEMMAS, a framework to evaluate the collaboration quality of multi-agent systems using graph-based metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing evaluations that only focus on output correctness, neglecting inefficient communication and coordination in multi-agent systems.

Method: Developed a graph-based evaluation framework called GEMMAS, proposing new metrics: Information Diversity Score (IDS) and Unnecessary Path Ratio (UPR) to measure collaboration quality.

Result: On the GSM8K benchmark, the study reveals considerable differences in collaboration quality (IDS and UPR) despite small differences in task accuracy.

Conclusion: Outcome-only metrics are inadequate for evaluating multi-agent systems; process-level diagnostics are key for designing effective and resource-efficient systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on language models have shown strong performance on
collaborative reasoning tasks. However, existing evaluations focus only on the
correctness of the final output, overlooking how inefficient communication and
poor coordination contribute to redundant reasoning and higher computational
costs. We introduce GEMMAS, a graph-based evaluation framework that analyzes
the internal collaboration process by modeling agent interactions as a directed
acyclic graph. To capture collaboration quality, we propose two process-level
metrics: Information Diversity Score (IDS) to measure semantic variation in
inter-agent messages, and Unnecessary Path Ratio (UPR) to quantify redundant
reasoning paths. We evaluate GEMMAS across five benchmarks and highlight
results on GSM8K, where systems with only a 2.1% difference in accuracy differ
by 12.8% in IDS and 80% in UPR, revealing substantial variation in internal
collaboration. These findings demonstrate that outcome-only metrics are
insufficient for evaluating multi-agent performance and highlight the
importance of process-level diagnostics in designing more interpretable and
resource-efficient collaborative AI systems.

TL;DR: This paper presents a system using automatic speech recognition and machine learning to assess oral narratives of preschool children, focusing on Afrikaans and isiXhosa languages. It aims to help teachers identify students needing intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teachers often struggle to accurately identify preschool children who need intervention in large classrooms, despite the importance of developing narrative and comprehension skills early.

Method: The system integrates automatic speech recognition and machine learning scoring models to assess oral narratives, with comparisons between linear models and large language models (LLMs) for accuracy.

Result: The LLM-based system outperformed the linear model in most cases and proved comparable to human experts in identifying children requiring intervention.

Conclusion: The study establishes a foundation for automatic oral narrative assessments, facilitating teachers in providing personalized support and improving early literacy skill development in classrooms.

Abstract: Developing narrative and comprehension skills in early childhood is critical
for later literacy. However, teachers in large preschool classrooms struggle to
accurately identify students who require intervention. We present a system for
automatically assessing oral narratives of preschool children in Afrikaans and
isiXhosa. The system uses automatic speech recognition followed by a machine
learning scoring model to predict narrative and comprehension scores. For
scoring predicted transcripts, we compare a linear model to a large language
model (LLM). The LLM-based system outperforms the linear model in most cases,
but the linear system is competitive despite its simplicity. The LLM-based
system is comparable to a human expert in flagging children who require
intervention. We lay the foundation for automatic oral assessments in
classrooms, giving teachers extra capacity to focus on personalised support for
children's learning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework, CAST, which manipulates the latent activations of large language models to improve cross-task transfer, particularly for low-resource tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of large language models in handling unseen tasks, especially in data-scarce scenarios, by exploring an alternative to conventional fine-tuning or input-based methods.

Method: The proposed CAST framework analyzes and manipulates activation patterns in LLMs' latent space. It selects influential examples from high-resource tasks and leverages their contrastive representation-enhanced activations to adapt LLMs to low-resource tasks.

Result: CAST demonstrates improved performance over competitive baselines in cross-domain and cross-lingual transfer settings, while also ensuring better scalability and reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: Activation manipulation via CAST provides a robust, scalable, and efficient approach for cross-task transfer using large language models without requiring parameter updates or input expansion.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in leveraging
pretrained knowledge through prompting, but they often struggle with unseen
tasks, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. While cross-task in-context
learning offers a direct solution for transferring knowledge across tasks, it
still faces critical challenges in terms of robustness, scalability, and
efficiency. In this paper, we investigate whether cross-task transfer can be
achieved via latent space steering without parameter updates or input
expansion. Through an analysis of activation patterns in the latent space of
LLMs, we observe that the enhanced activations induced by in-context examples
have consistent patterns across different tasks. Inspired by these findings, we
propose CAST, a novel Cross-task Activation Steering Transfer framework that
enables effective transfer by manipulating the model's internal activation
states. Our approach first selects influential and diverse samples from
high-resource tasks, then utilizes their contrastive representation-enhanced
activations to adapt LLMs to low-resource tasks. Extensive experiments across
both cross-domain and cross-lingual transfer settings show that our method
outperforms competitive baselines and demonstrates superior scalability and
lower computational costs.

### [49] [HATS: Hindi Analogy Test Set for Evaluating Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13238)
*Ashray Gupta,Rohan Joseph,Sunny Rai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS) assesses reasoning capabilities of multilingual large language models (LLMs) through analogies sourced from Indian government exams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analogies serve as a crucial benchmark for evaluating reasoning abilities, but LLMs have been understudied in Indic languages like Hindi.

Method: The paper introduces HATS, consisting of 405 Hindi analogy questions, and benchmarks multilingual LLMs with various prompting strategies, including a cognitive theory-based "grounded Chain of Thought" approach.

Result: Experiments reveal models perform best with English prompts, regardless of the prompting strategy, while the grounded approach enhances overall performance on Hindi analogy questions.

Conclusion: HATS fills a critical gap in evaluating LLMs' reasoning abilities in Hindi and highlights language-specific limitations in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Analogies test a model's ability to infer implicit relationships between
concepts, making them a key benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities.
While large language models (LLMs) are widely evaluated for reasoning in
English, their abilities in Indic languages remain understudied, limiting our
understanding of whether these models generalize across languages. To address
this gap, we introduce a new Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS), comprising 405
multiple-choice questions sourced from Indian government exams. We benchmark
state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs using various prompting strategies and
introduce a grounded Chain of Thought approach that leverages cognitive
theories of analogical reasoning. This approach improves model performance on
Hindi analogy questions. Our experiments show that models perform best with
English prompts, irrespective of the prompting strategy. Our test set addresses
the lack of a critical resource to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities in
Hindi.

### [50] [Automating Steering for Safe Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13255)
*Lyucheng Wu,Mengru Wang,Ziwen Xu,Tri Cao,Nay Oo,Bryan Hooi,Shumin Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoSteer, an inference-time intervention framework to improve the safety of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) without model fine-tuning, effectively reducing risks from adversarial inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the new safety challenges in MLLMs arising from adversarial inputs during inference, as MLLMs begin displaying advanced cross-modal reasoning capabilities.

Method: The paper proposes AutoSteer, which includes a Safety Awareness Score (SAS) for identifying key safety-related internal signals, an adaptive safety prober for assessing risk, and a Refusal Head to intervene and modulate generation when necessary.

Result: Experiments show that AutoSteer significantly decreases the Attack Success Rate (ASR) across various safety-critical benchmarks, while preserving the general capabilities of the MLLMs.

Conclusion: AutoSteer is an interpretable and modular framework that enables safer and more responsible deployment of MLLMs by reducing safety risks during inference.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked
powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns,
particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the
safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive
inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any
fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core
components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically
identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal
layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of
toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal
Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are
detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical
benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success
Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining
general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical,
interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI
systems.

*Jiazheng Li,Hong Lu,Kaiyue Wen,Zaiwen Yang,Jiaxuan Gao,Hongzhou Lin,Yi Wu,Jingzhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes QuestA, a method that augments reinforcement learning (RL) training for large language models (LLMs) by introducing partial solutions to improve reasoning on hard problems, achieving new state-of-the-art results in math reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in enhancing multi-step reasoning in large language models, especially on difficult problems where standard RL often struggles.

Method: The authors introduce Question Augmentation (QuestA), which involves supplying partial solutions during RL training to reduce task complexity and provide better learning signals, thereby enhancing reasoning capabilities.

Result: QuestA led to significant performance improvements in math reasoning tasks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on benchmarks such as AIME24, AIME25, and HMMT25 with a 1.5B-parameter model.

Conclusion: QuestA improves sample efficiency in RL and demonstrates a practical, generalizable approach to enhance reasoning capabilities in language models, achieving continuous improvement over strong models and advancing state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key component in training large
language reasoning models (LLMs). However, recent studies questions its
effectiveness in improving multi-step reasoning-particularly on hard problems.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy via
Question Augmentation: introduce partial solutions during training to reduce
problem difficulty and provide more informative learning signals. Our method,
QuestA, when applied during RL training on math reasoning tasks, not only
improves pass@1 but also pass@k-particularly on problems where standard RL
struggles to make progress. This enables continual improvement over strong
open-source models such as DeepScaleR and OpenMath Nemotron, further enhancing
their reasoning capabilities. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on math
benchmarks using 1.5B-parameter models: 67.1% (+5.3%) on AIME24, 59.5% (+10.0%)
on AIME25, and 35.5% (+4.0%) on HMMT25. Further, we provide theoretical
explanations that QuestA improves sample efficiency, offering a practical and
generalizable pathway for expanding reasoning capability through RL.

*Luis Gasco,Hermenegildo Fabregat,Laura García-Sardiña,Paula Estrella,Daniel Deniz,Alvaro Rodrigo,Rabih Zbib*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TalentCLEF 2025, an evaluation initiative focusing on job title intelligence and skill prediction using multilingual datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to address the lack of reliable, fair models and publicly available benchmarks for applying NLP technologies in human capital management, particularly in talent acquisition and workforce planning.

Method: TalentCLEF 2025 includes two tasks: Task A on multilingual job title matching and Task B on skill prediction based on job titles. Both tasks use anonymized and annotated real-world labor market data. The evaluations cover monolingual, cross-lingual, and gender bias scenarios with contributions from 76 teams and 280 submissions.

Result: The systems implemented techniques like multilingual encoder-based models, fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and data augmentation using large language models. Results indicate that training strategies significantly impact performance more than model size.

Conclusion: TalentCLEF establishes the first benchmark in this domain, promoting the development of robust, fair, and transferable NLP solutions for the labor market.

Abstract: Advances in natural language processing and large language models are driving
a major transformation in Human Capital Management, with a growing interest in
building smart systems based on language technologies for talent acquisition,
upskilling strategies, and workforce planning. However, the adoption and
progress of these technologies critically depend on the development of reliable
and fair models, properly evaluated on public data and open benchmarks, which
have so far been unavailable in this domain.
  To address this gap, we present TalentCLEF 2025, the first evaluation
campaign focused on skill and job title intelligence. The lab consists of two
tasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish,
German, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English.
Both corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and
manually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor
market data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.
  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered
the evaluation of gender bias.
  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions. Most
systems relied on information retrieval techniques built with multilingual
encoder-based models fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and several of them
incorporated large language models for data augmentation or re-ranking. The
results show that the training strategies have a larger effect than the size of
the model alone. TalentCLEF provides the first public benchmark in this field
and encourages the development of robust, fair, and transferable language
technologies for the labor market.

*Wang Xi,Quan Shi,Tian Yu,Yujie Peng,Jiayi Sun,Mengxing Ren,Zenghui Ding,Ningguang Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces RCPS, an advanced framework, for generating professional-level media presentations, integrating novel techniques for narrative, layout, and quality optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Media presentations often fail due to logical inconsistencies and suboptimal layouts, making it difficult to match professional standards.

Method: The RCPS framework utilizes Deep Structured Narrative Planning, Adaptive Layout Generation, and an Iterative Optimization Loop. Additionally, the authors propose PREVAL, a preference-based evaluation model for assessing presentation quality.

Result: RCPS outperformed baseline methods in Content, Coherence, and Design dimensions, closely matching human expert standards. PREVAL demonstrated strong correlation with human judgment in assessment accuracy.

Conclusion: RCPS successfully addresses the challenges of automated media presentations with its innovative framework, and PREVAL provides a reliable tool to measure and enhance presentation quality.

Abstract: Automated generation of high-quality media presentations is challenging,
requiring robust content extraction, narrative planning, visual design, and
overall quality optimization. Existing methods often produce presentations with
logical inconsistencies and suboptimal layouts, thereby struggling to meet
professional standards. To address these challenges, we introduce RCPS
(Reflective Coherent Presentation Synthesis), a novel framework integrating
three key components: (1) Deep Structured Narrative Planning; (2) Adaptive
Layout Generation; (3) an Iterative Optimization Loop. Additionally, we propose
PREVAL, a preference-based evaluation framework employing rationale-enhanced
multi-dimensional models to assess presentation quality across Content,
Coherence, and Design. Experimental results demonstrate that RCPS significantly
outperforms baseline methods across all quality dimensions, producing
presentations that closely approximate human expert standards. PREVAL shows
strong correlation with human judgments, validating it as a reliable automated
tool for assessing presentation quality.

### [54] [AbGen: Evaluating Large Language Models in Ablation Study Design and Evaluation for Scientific Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13300)
*Yilun Zhao,Weiyuan Chen,Zhijian Xu,Manasi Patwardhan,Yixin Liu,Chengye Wang,Lovekesh Vig,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AbGen is the first benchmark for testing LLMs' ability to design ablation studies, featuring 1,500 expert-annotated examples. Current LLMs underperform compared to humans in study design quality, and automated evaluations for these tasks are unreliable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to assess and improve the ability of LLMs to handle complex scientific tasks, such as creating ablation studies, which require precision and expertise.

Method: The authors created AbGen by collecting and annotating examples from NLP papers. They evaluated LLM performance using expert metrics and developed AbGen-Eval to assess automated evaluation systems.

Result: LLMs show significant gaps compared to human experts in creating ablation studies, and automated evaluation systems demonstrate reliability issues in this task.

Conclusion: AbGen and AbGen-Eval provide valuable benchmarks for testing LLMs' scientific rigor and offer pathways for future improvement in reliable LLM evaluation systems.

Abstract: We introduce AbGen, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities
of LLMs in designing ablation studies for scientific research. AbGen consists
of 1,500 expert-annotated examples derived from 807 NLP papers. In this
benchmark, LLMs are tasked with generating detailed ablation study designs for
a specified module or process based on the given research context. Our
evaluation of leading LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and o4-mini, highlights a
significant performance gap between these models and human experts in terms of
the importance, faithfulness, and soundness of the ablation study designs.
Moreover, we demonstrate that current automated evaluation methods are not
reliable for our task, as they show a significant discrepancy when compared to
human assessment. To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a
meta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used
automated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task. We
investigate various LLM-as-Judge systems on AbGen-Eval, providing insights for
future research on developing more effective and reliable LLM-based evaluation
systems for complex scientific tasks.

*Guimin Hu,Daniel Hershcovich,Hasti Seifi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HapticCap, a dataset linking user captions to vibration haptic signals, addresses challenges in this domain, and proposes a retrieval task, achieving success with a specific model combination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and designing meaningful haptic signals for diverse user descriptions is difficult due to the lack of annotated datasets and limited task capabilities.

Method: Created the HapticCap dataset with 92,070 haptic-text pairs and implemented a supervised contrastive learning framework for a haptic-caption retrieval task.

Result: The best performance was achieved by using the combination of T5 (language model) and AST (audio model) with separate training for each category.

Conclusion: HapticCap establishes a foundation for future research in linking textual descriptions with haptic signals, paving the way for more effective designs.

Abstract: Haptic signals, from smartphone vibrations to virtual reality touch feedback,
can effectively convey information and enhance realism, but designing signals
that resonate meaningfully with users is challenging. To facilitate this, we
introduce a multimodal dataset and task, of matching user descriptions to
vibration haptic signals, and highlight two primary challenges: (1) lack of
large haptic vibration datasets annotated with textual descriptions as
collecting haptic descriptions is time-consuming, and (2) limited capability of
existing tasks and models to describe vibration signals in text. To advance
this area, we create HapticCap, the first fully human-annotated
haptic-captioned dataset, containing 92,070 haptic-text pairs for user
descriptions of sensory, emotional, and associative attributes of vibrations.
Based on HapticCap, we propose the haptic-caption retrieval task and present
the results of this task from a supervised contrastive learning framework that
brings together text representations within specific categories and vibrations.
Overall, the combination of language model T5 and audio model AST yields the
best performance in the haptic-caption retrieval task, especially when
separately trained for each description category.

### [56] [Social and Political Framing in Search Engine Results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13325)
*Amrit Poudel,Tim Weninger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Search engines influence public discourse by reflecting and amplifying biases, particularly through ideologically-driven user queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the role of search engines and user queries in contributing to bias and information polarization.

Method: Analysis of major search engine outputs using a dataset focused on political and social topics.

Result: Search engines prioritize content based on biases, and ideologically-driven queries amplify these biases. Significant differences in content prioritization were also found across search engines.

Conclusion: Search engines not only reflect biases but also reinforce ideological divides, contributing to information polarization.

Abstract: Search engines play a crucial role in shaping public discourse by influencing
how information is accessed and framed. While prior research has extensively
examined various dimensions of search bias -- such as content prioritization,
indexical bias, political polarization, and sources of bias -- an important
question remains underexplored: how do search engines and
ideologically-motivated user queries contribute to bias in search results. This
study analyzes the outputs of major search engines using a dataset of political
and social topics. The findings reveal that search engines not only prioritize
content in ways that reflect underlying biases but also that
ideologically-driven user queries exacerbate these biases, resulting in the
amplification of specific narratives. Moreover, significant differences were
observed across search engines in terms of the sources they prioritize. These
results suggest that search engines may play a pivotal role in shaping public
perceptions by reinforcing ideological divides, thereby contributing to the
broader issue of information polarization.

*Yulu Qin,Dheeraj Varghese,Adam Dahlgren Lindström,Lucia Donatelli,Kanishka Misra,Najoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether vision-and-language (VL) training changes the linguistic representations of language models (LMs), finding that VL training improves task-specific knowledge deployment without significantly altering taxonomic knowledge itself.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if VL training impacts language models' linguistic representations, particularly in the domain of lexical-conceptual knowledge and taxonomic organization.

Method: The researchers compared text-only language models (LMs) with VL-trained counterparts on a text-only question-answering task, conducting both behavioral and representational analyses.

Result: VL models outperformed text-only LMs in tasks requiring taxonomic understanding, though their core taxonomic knowledge remained similar. The difference lay in improved question representation involving taxonomic relations for VL-trained models.

Conclusion: VL training doesn’t significantly alter taxonomic knowledge but enhances how this knowledge is applied in task-specific contexts.

Abstract: Does vision-and-language (VL) training change the linguistic representations
of language models in meaningful ways? Most results in the literature have
shown inconsistent or marginal differences, both behaviorally and
representationally. In this work, we start from the hypothesis that the domain
in which VL training could have a significant effect is lexical-conceptual
knowledge, in particular its taxonomic organization. Through comparing minimal
pairs of text-only LMs and their VL-trained counterparts, we first show that
the VL models often outperform their text-only counterparts on a text-only
question-answering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts
mentioned in the questions. Using an array of targeted behavioral and
representational analyses, we show that the LMs and VLMs do not differ
significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself, but they differ in
how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs.
a non-taxonomic relation. This implies that the taxonomic knowledge itself does
not change substantially through additional VL training, but VL training does
improve the deployment of this knowledge in the context of a specific task,
even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces TAIL, a method to enhance length generalization in LLMs by mimicking Turing Machine execution with synthesized chain-of-thought data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for length generalization in LLMs are task-specific and limited. This study seeks a more universal solution applicable to a broad range of computable reasoning problems.

Method: TAIL synthesizes chain-of-thought data to imitate Turing Machine processes, breaking reasoning into atomic steps and introducing explicit memory mechanisms for handling long-range dependencies.

Result: TAIL significantly boosts length generalization of Qwen2.5-7B across various synthetic tasks, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating Turing Machine principles, rather than conventional thinking styles, is essential for advancing LLM reasoning capabilities. This provides a strong path for learning from synthetic data in future research.

Abstract: Length generalization, the ability to solve problems of longer sequences than
those observed during training, poses a core challenge of Transformer-based
large language models (LLM). Although existing studies have predominantly
focused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic
manipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited
overall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a
broader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that
algorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this
perspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to
improve the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes
chain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing
Machine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into
atomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch
mechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in
elementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we
construct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and
18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length
generalization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various
tasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1.
The experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine,
instead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length
generalization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors
consistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers.
This work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of
LLM reasoning from synthetic data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper surveys Context Engineering, a field optimizing information for LLMs, presenting a taxonomy of foundational components and system implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs heavily rely on inference context, necessitating systematic optimization beyond simple prompt design.

Method: A taxonomy is developed, analyzing context retrieval, processing, management, and their integrations in advanced systems using over 1300 papers.

Result: The survey highlights the asymmetry between LLM's context understanding and their limitation in generating sophisticated, long-form outputs.

Conclusion: Context Engineering establishes a unified framework and identifies key research challenges for enhancing LLM capabilities.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally determined
by the contextual information provided during inference. This survey introduces
Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design
to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We
present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its
foundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate
them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components:
context retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We
then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create
sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through
this systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only
establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical
research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While
current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate
remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit
pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs.
Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately,
this survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers
advancing context-aware AI.

*Tyler Loakman,William Thorne,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain various forms of humour and highlights gaps in their performance with a curated dataset of diverse jokes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the observation that computational humour research has largely focused on simple pun-based jokes, ignoring the complexity and diversity of humour forms.

Method: The authors curate a dataset of 600 jokes across four joke types and provide manually written high-quality explanations. They evaluate the zero-shot performance of various LLMs in explaining different types of jokes.

Result: The study finds that none of the tested LLMs can reliably generate adequate explanations for all types of jokes, particularly those requiring world knowledge or complex reasoning.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the limitations of LLMs in explaining diverse humour forms and point to the need for broader research in computational humour beyond simple jokes.

Abstract: Humour, as a complex language form, is derived from myriad aspects of life,
whilst existing work on computational humour has focussed almost exclusively on
short pun-based jokes. In this work, we investigate whether the ability of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain humour depends on the particular humour
form. We compare models on simple puns and more complex topical humour that
requires knowledge of real-world entities and events. In doing so, we curate a
dataset of 600 jokes split across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality
explanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns,
contemporary internet humour, and topical jokes, where understanding relies on
reasoning beyond "common sense", rooted instead in world knowledge regarding
news events and pop culture. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot
abilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of
different types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour
explanation. We find that none of the tested models (inc. reasoning models) are
capable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further
highlighting the narrow focus of most works in computational humour on overly
simple joke forms.

TL;DR: EaGERS is a training-free, model-agnostic pipeline improving transparency and performance in DocVQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to enhance transparency, reproducibility, and performance in visual question answering tasks like DocVQA without the need for additional fine-tuning.

Method: EaGERS uses a vision-language model to generate rationales, grounds them spatially using embedding similarity and majority voting, and selectively uses relevant masked regions for response generation.

Result: EaGERS outperforms the base model in terms of accuracy and Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity on the DocVQA dataset.

Conclusion: EaGERS demonstrates that a training-free and model-agnostic approach can improve both performance and transparency in DocVQA tasks.

Abstract: We introduce EaGERS, a fully training-free and model-agnostic pipeline that
(1) generates natural language rationales via a vision language model, (2)
grounds these rationales to spatial sub-regions by computing multimodal
embedding similarities over a configurable grid with majority voting, and (3)
restricts the generation of responses only from the relevant regions selected
in the masked image. Experiments on the DocVQA dataset demonstrate that our
best configuration not only outperforms the base model on exact match accuracy
and Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity metrics but also enhances
transparency and reproducibility in DocVQA without additional model
fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MindJourney, a framework that adds 3D reasoning capabilities to vision-language models (VLMs) using video diffusion-based world models, achieving better performance in spatial reasoning tasks without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art VLMs often fail at simple spatial reasoning tasks in 3D, like predicting visual updates after movement, as they lack an internal model of 3D dynamics.

Method: MindJourney pairs a VLM with a controllable video diffusion-based world model. During test-time, the VLM explores by simulating camera motions, gathering multi-view evidence, and improving reasoning iteratively.

Result: MindJourney yields an average 8% performance improvement on the SAT spatial reasoning benchmark without requiring fine-tuning. It also outperforms inference VLMs trained through reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Coupling VLMs with world models for test-time scaling is an effective and plug-and-play approach to enhance 3D spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D space is central to human cognition and indispensable
for embodied tasks such as navigation and manipulation. However,
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle frequently with tasks
as simple as anticipating how a scene will look after an egocentric motion:
they perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dynamics. We therefore
propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this
missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video
diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the
world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then
reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive
exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average
8% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT,
showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a
simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning. Meanwhile, our method also
improves upon the test-time inference VLMs trained through reinforcement
learning, which demonstrates the potential of our method that utilizes world

TL;DR: The paper introduces advanced monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) addressing issues of unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting in existing models. They propose Mono-InternVL and Mono-InternVL-1.5 systems with innovative pre-training and efficient architectures that achieve competitive performance at lower costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monolithic MLLMs face challenges like unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting during pre-training. The authors aim to embed visual knowledge into pre-trained LLMs while addressing noisy data and efficiency in training and inference.

Method: They develop Mono-InternVL using a multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture and progressive Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP). Mono-InternVL-1.5 improves upon this with EViP++, adding efficient visual attention experts and optimized pre-training processes.

Result: Mono-InternVL surpasses existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out of 15 benchmarks, including a significant improvement on OCRBench. Mono-InternVL-1.5 retains similar performance compared to modular InternVL-1.5 while drastically reducing latency and costs.

Conclusion: Mono-InternVL and Mono-InternVL-1.5 demonstrate competitive multimodal performance, efficient cost reductions, and stability improvements in optimization. These advancements mark significant progress in monolithic MLLM designs.

Abstract: This paper focuses on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
which integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single model.
Existing structures and pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often
suffer from unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. To address these
challenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a
pre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data
via delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an
advanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a
multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an
innovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize
its visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves
competitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively
expensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper
and stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++
introduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and
re-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,
it includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these
designs, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,
while still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate
our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out
of 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared
to its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves
similar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reviews and evaluates methods for large-scale pixel-wise crop mapping using satellite imagery. It identifies optimal workflows for supervised and transfer learning approaches through extensive experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accuracy and efficiency in identifying and classifying crop types using satellite data and address challenges related to domain shifts, sample sizes, and variable combinations in crop mapping workflows.

Method: Systematic experiments were conducted on six preprocessing methods and 11 classification models, assessed under different sample sizes and domain shifts. Transfer learning techniques were also analyzed to enhance workflow adaptability.

Result: Transformer models with fine-scale interval preprocessing produced superior performance. RF models offered quick training and competitive results. Fine-tuning and UDA proved effective for transfer learning scenarios depending on domain and sample availability.

Conclusion: Supervised learning provides accurate results with sufficient labeled samples, whereas transfer learning is useful under conditions of limited samples and significant domain shifts, emphasizing the importance of workflow choice in crop mapping applications.

Abstract: Crop mapping involves identifying and classifying crop types using spatial
data, primarily derived from remote sensing imagery. This study presents the
first comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,
encompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer
learning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,
we conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite
image-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise
classification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of
varied training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified
optimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.
The evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural
sites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from
CDL trusted pixels and field surveys.
  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval
preprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal
performance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid
training and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and
direct transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques
enhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop
classes while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,
workflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a
sufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate
and generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that
matches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop
mapping. Repository:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the lack of publicly available eye-tracking datasets and tools tailored for the 3D complexity of CT scans, enhancing interpretable computer-aided diagnosis systems.

Method: The authors developed CT-ScanGaze, a 3D eye gaze dataset, and CT-Searcher, a 3D scanpath predictor pre-trained on converted 2D gaze data and evaluated on both qualitative and quantitative benchmarks.

Result: CT-Searcher demonstrates high effectiveness in mimicking radiologist-like 3D fixation sequences, validated using the new CT-ScanGaze dataset.

Conclusion: The study provides a novel dataset, method, and evaluation framework, advancing the field of 3D gaze prediction in CT and laying groundwork for future developments in medical imaging.

Abstract: Understanding radiologists' eye movement during Computed Tomography (CT)
reading is crucial for developing effective interpretable computer-aided
diagnosis systems. However, CT research in this area has been limited by the
lack of publicly available eye-tracking datasets and the three-dimensional
complexity of CT volumes. To address these challenges, we present the first
publicly available eye gaze dataset on CT, called CT-ScanGaze. Then, we
introduce CT-Searcher, a novel 3D scanpath predictor designed specifically to
process CT volumes and generate radiologist-like 3D fixation sequences,
overcoming the limitations of current scanpath predictors that only handle 2D
inputs. Since deep learning models benefit from a pretraining step, we develop
a pipeline that converts existing 2D gaze datasets into 3D gaze data to
pretrain CT-Searcher. Through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on
CT-ScanGaze, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and provide a
comprehensive assessment framework for 3D scanpath prediction in medical
imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MS-DGCNN++, a dynamic graph convolutional network for tree species classification and 3D object recognition, achieving improved accuracy with lower complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing MS-DGCNN models in capturing hierarchical semantic relationships crucial for tree species classification from complex LiDAR point clouds.

Method: A hierarchical multiscale fusion approach is implemented, utilizing semantically meaningful feature extraction at local, branch, and canopy scales with cross-scale information propagation.

Result: MS-DGCNN++ achieved 94.96% accuracy on STPCTLS, 67.25% on FOR-species20K, and improved performance on 3D recognition tasks, outperforming existing methods while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: The method offers a resource-efficient and accurate solution for point cloud processing, with potential applications beyond tree classification.

Abstract: Tree species classification from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds is
challenging because of the complex multi-scale geometric structures in forest
environments. Existing approaches using multi-scale dynamic graph convolutional
neural networks (MS-DGCNN) employ parallel multi-scale processing, which fails
to capture the semantic relationships between the hierarchical levels of the
tree architecture. We present MS-DGCNN++, a hierarchical multiscale fusion
dynamic graph convolutional network that uses semantically meaningful feature
extraction at local, branch, and canopy scales with cross-scale information
propagation. Our method employs scale-specific feature engineering, including
standard geometric features for the local scale, normalized relative vectors
for the branch scale, and distance information for the canopy scale. This
hierarchical approach replaces uniform parallel processing with semantically
differentiated representations that are aligned with the natural tree
structure. Under the same proposed tree species data augmentation strategy for
all experiments, MS-DGCNN++ achieved an accuracy of 94.96 \% on STPCTLS,
outperforming DGCNN, MS-DGCNN, and the state-of-the-art model PPT. On
FOR-species20K, it achieves 67.25\% accuracy (6.1\% improvement compared to
MS-DGCNN). For standard 3D object recognition, our method outperformed DGCNN
and MS-DGCNN with overall accuracies of 93.15\% on ModelNet40 and 94.05\% on
ModelNet10. With lower parameters and reduced complexity compared to
state-of-the-art transformer approaches, our method is suitable for
resource-constrained applications while maintaining a competitive accuracy.
Beyond tree classification, the method generalizes to standard 3D object
recognition, establishing it as a versatile solution for diverse point cloud
processing applications. The implementation code is publicly available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to address the lack of annotated datasets for applying human action recognition to sports scenarios, specifically in predicting soccer penalty kick shot directions.

Method: The paper presents a manually annotated dataset for penalty kick shot direction prediction and proposes a deep learning classifier that combines HAR-based feature embeddings with contextual metadata.

Result: The model evaluates 22 backbone architectures and achieves up to 63.9% accuracy in predicting shot direction, surpassing the decision-making performance of real goalkeepers.

Conclusion: The dataset and proposed approach provide significant advancements for anticipatory action recognition and showcase potential for predictive tasks in sports analytics.

Abstract: Action anticipation has become a prominent topic in Human Action Recognition
(HAR). However, its application to real-world sports scenarios remains limited
by the availability of suitable annotated datasets. This work presents a novel
dataset of manually annotated soccer penalty kicks to predict shot direction
based on pre-kick player movements. We propose a deep learning classifier to
benchmark this dataset that integrates HAR-based feature embeddings with
contextual metadata. We evaluate twenty-two backbone models across seven
architecture families (MViTv2, MViTv1, SlowFast, Slow, X3D, I3D, C2D),
achieving up to 63.9% accuracy in predicting shot direction (left or right),
outperforming the real goalkeepers' decisions. These results demonstrate the
dataset's value for anticipatory action recognition and validate our model's
potential as a generalizable approach for sports-based predictive tasks.

*Sandipan Sarma,Agney Talwarr,Arijit Sur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Funnel-HOI, a top-down framework for human-object interaction detection (HOID) that improves zero-shot learning and addresses long-tail distribution problems using novel mechanisms and loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the long-tail distribution problem in HOID due to the limited labeled data and to improve the performance of zero-shot learning frameworks with better scene interpretation.

Method: The method involves a top-down framework, Funnel-HOI, which uses a novel asymmetric co-attention mechanism to mine object and action cues and an innovative loss function that considers object-action relations to improve interaction classification in zero-shot scenarios.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates significant gains in performance on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets, with improvements of up to 12.4% on unseen HOI categories and 8.4% on rare categories.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that incorporating HOI-specific cues during the encoding stage and regulating misclassification penalties with an advanced loss function lead to state-of-the-art performance in HOID, particularly for unseen and rare interactions.

Abstract: Human-object interaction detection (HOID) refers to localizing interactive
human-object pairs in images and identifying the interactions. Since there
could be an exponential number of object-action combinations, labeled data is
limited - leading to a long-tail distribution problem. Recently, zero-shot
learning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object
detectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their
primary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or
disentangled interpretations of interactions. We advocate that HOI-specific
cues must be anticipated at the encoder stage itself to obtain a stronger scene
interpretation. Consequently, we build a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI
inspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then
associate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding. We first
probe an image for the presence of objects (well-defined concepts) and then
probe for actions (abstract concepts) associated with them. A novel asymmetric
co-attention mechanism mines these cues utilizing multimodal information
(incorporating zero-shot capabilities) and yields stronger interaction
representations at the encoder level. Furthermore, a novel loss is devised that
considers objectaction relatedness and regulates misclassification penalty
better than existing loss functions for guiding the interaction classifier.
Extensive experiments on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets across
fully-supervised and six zero-shot settings reveal our state-of-the-art
performance, with up to 12.4% and 8.4% gains for unseen and rare HOI
categories, respectively.

*Kaihua Chen,Tarasha Khurana,Deva Ramanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents "CogNVS," a method for synthesizing novel views of dynamic scenes using monocular videos. It uses a combination of 3D scene reconstruction and a video inpainting diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in prior approaches that either require expensive test-time optimization or fail to preserve scene geometry during training.

Method: The approach combines 3D scene reconstruction for visible pixels and a feed-forward video inpainting diffusion model (CogNVS) for hidden pixels. CogNVS is trained self-supervised on a large dataset of 2D videos and then applied zero-shot to new videos via test-time finetuning.

Result: CogNVS outperforms most prior methods for novel-view synthesis of dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: The method effectively synthesizes realistic novel views of dynamic scenes from monocular videos, demonstrating superior performance through its innovative use of a diffusion model and self-supervised training.

Abstract: We explore novel-view synthesis for dynamic scenes from monocular videos.
Prior approaches rely on costly test-time optimization of 4D representations or
do not preserve scene geometry when trained in a feed-forward manner. Our
approach is based on three key insights: (1) covisible pixels (that are visible
in both the input and target views) can be rendered by first reconstructing the
dynamic 3D scene and rendering the reconstruction from the novel-views and (2)
hidden pixels in novel views can be "inpainted" with feed-forward 2D video
diffusion models. Notably, our video inpainting diffusion model (CogNVS) can be
self-supervised from 2D videos, allowing us to train it on a large corpus of
in-the-wild videos. This in turn allows for (3) CogNVS to be applied zero-shot
to novel test videos via test-time finetuning. We empirically verify that
CogNVS outperforms almost all prior art for novel-view synthesis of dynamic
scenes from monocular videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study integrates retinal microvasculature traits with serum lipidomic profiles to identify early biomarkers of cardiovascular disease.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for detecting cardiovascular disease risk often miss early subclinical changes, and there is a need to explore novel indicators for early detection.

Method: A deep learning-based imaging omics framework was used to analyze retinal microvascular traits and serum lipidomic profiles from a large, healthy population. Retinal phenotypes were quantified using automated image tools, and lipid profiling was done with UHPLC ESI HRMS.

Result: Strong age- and sex-independent correlations were found between retinal vascular traits and lipid subclasses like triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, and ceramides, suggesting microvascular remodeling under metabolic stress.

Conclusion: Linking vascular phenotypes to specific lipid species can improve early detection, prevention, and personalized care for cardiovascular disease.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading global cause of mortality,
yet current risk stratification methods often fail to detect early, subclinical
changes. Previous studies have generally not integrated retinal
microvasculature characteristics with comprehensive serum lipidomic profiles as
potential indicators of CVD risk. In this study, an innovative imaging omics
framework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived
through deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to
highlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the
conventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate
adjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population,
which is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal
phenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum
lipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography
Electrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS).
Strong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly
between average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as
triacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These
associations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under
metabolic stress. By linking detailed
  vascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a
critical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis. This integration
not only offers a novel perspective on microvascular metabolic associations but
also presents a significant opportunity for the identification of robust,
non-invasive biomarkers. Ultimately, these findings may support improved early
detection, targeted prevention, and personalized approaches in cardiovascular
healthcare.

Result: FORTRESS reduces parameters by 91%, computational complexity by 91%, and improves inference speed by 3x. It achieves state-of-the-art results with an F1-score of 0.771 and mean IoU of 0.677.

Conclusion: FORTRESS successfully balances accuracy and efficiency, making it an effective solution for structural defect segmentation in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Automated structural defect segmentation in civil infrastructure faces a
critical challenge: achieving high accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency for real-time deployment. This paper presents FORTRESS
(Function-composition Optimized Real-Time Resilient Structural Segmentation), a
new architecture that balances accuracy and speed by using a special method
that combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network integration. FORTRESS incorporates three key innovations: a systematic
depthwise separable convolution framework achieving a 3.6x parameter reduction
per layer, adaptive TiKAN integration that selectively applies function
composition transformations only when computationally beneficial, and
multi-scale attention fusion combining spatial, channel, and KAN-enhanced
features across decoder levels. The architecture achieves remarkable efficiency
gains with 91% parameter reduction (31M to 2.9M), 91% computational complexity
reduction (13.7 to 1.17 GFLOPs), and 3x inference speed improvement while
delivering superior segmentation performance. Evaluation on benchmark
infrastructure datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art results with an F1- score
of 0.771 and a mean IoU of 0.677, significantly outperforming existing methods
including U-Net, SA-UNet, and U- KAN. The dual optimization strategy proves
essential for optimal performance, establishing FORTRESS as a robust solution

Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in modeling the diverse and flexible shapes of plant leaves, which are critical in both agriculture and computer graphics.

Method: The approach involves representing leaves as 2D base shapes combined with 3D deformations, utilizing a skeleton-free skinning model and a newly captured 3D dataset called DeformLeaf.

Result: NeuraLeaf successfully generates a wide range of deformable leaf shapes and fits accurately to 3D observations such as depth maps and point clouds.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates NeuraLeaf's capability in efficient and accurate plant leaf modeling, while making the implementation and dataset publicly accessible for broader use.

Abstract: We develop a neural parametric model for 3D leaves for plant modeling and
reconstruction that are essential for agriculture and computer graphics. While
neural parametric models are actively studied for humans and animals, plant
leaves present unique challenges due to their diverse shapes and flexible
deformation. To this problem, we introduce a neural parametric model for
leaves, NeuraLeaf. Capitalizing on the fact that flattened leaf shapes can be
approximated as a 2D plane, NeuraLeaf disentangles the leaves' geometry into
their 2D base shapes and 3D deformations. This representation allows learning
from rich sources of 2D leaf image datasets for the base shapes, and also has
the advantage of simultaneously learning textures aligned with the geometry. To
model the 3D deformation, we propose a novel skeleton-free skinning model and
create a newly captured 3D leaf dataset called DeformLeaf. We show that
NeuraLeaf successfully generates a wide range of leaf shapes with deformation,
resulting in accurate model fitting to 3D observations like depth maps and
point clouds. Our implementation and dataset are available at

Motivation: To improve the prediction of complex 3D rigid body dynamics by combining deep learning techniques with physics-informed frameworks.

Method: The authors developed a framework integrating a 3D physics simulator generating training data and a deep residual network architecture consisting of input, residual blocks, and output layers for learning dynamical patterns.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that HairShifter establishes a robust baseline for video-based hairstyle transfer and believe it will open new avenues in this field.

Abstract: Hair transfer is increasingly valuable across domains such as social media,
gaming, advertising, and entertainment. While significant progress has been
made in single-image hair transfer, video-based hair transfer remains
challenging due to the need for temporal consistency, spatial fidelity, and
dynamic adaptability. In this work, we propose HairShifter, a novel "Anchor

smooth and coherent video animation. At its core, HairShifter integrates a
Image Hair Transfer (IHT) module for precise per-frame transformation and a
Multi-Scale Gated SPADE Decoder to ensure seamless spatial blending and
temporal coherence. Our method maintains hairstyle fidelity across frames while
preserving non-hair regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairShifter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in video hairstyle transfer, combining
superior visual quality, temporal consistency, and scalability. The code will
be publicly available. We believe this work will open new avenues for
video-based hairstyle transfer and establish a robust baseline in this field.

It includes the Mamba Evolution Block (MEB) for spatiotemporal information aggregation, energy map shape priors for contour evolution, and a dual-classification synergy for simultaneous detection and segmentation optimization.

Result: Mamba Snake demonstrated superior performance in UMIS, achieving an average Dice score improvement of 3% across five clinical datasets compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Mamba Snake successfully addresses key challenges in UMIS by modeling inter-organ relationships and refining morphologies, showing promise as a robust approach for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Unified Medical Image Segmentation (UMIS) is critical for comprehensive
anatomical assessment but faces challenges due to multi-scale structural
heterogeneity. Conventional pixel-based approaches, lacking object-level
anatomical insight and inter-organ relational modeling, struggle with
morphological complexity and feature conflicts, limiting their efficacy in
UMIS. We propose Mamba Snake, a novel deep snake framework enhanced by state
space modeling for UMIS. Mamba Snake frames multi-contour evolution as a
hierarchical state space atlas, effectively modeling macroscopic inter-organ
topological relationships and microscopic contour refinements. We introduce a
snake-specific vision state space module, the Mamba Evolution Block (MEB),
which leverages effective spatiotemporal information aggregation for adaptive
refinement of complex morphologies. Energy map shape priors further ensure
robust long-range contour evolution in heterogeneous data. Additionally, a
dual-classification synergy mechanism is incorporated to concurrently optimize
detection and segmentation, mitigating under-segmentation of microstructures in
UMIS. Extensive evaluations across five clinical datasets reveal Mamba Snake's
superior performance, with an average Dice improvement of 3\% over
state-of-the-art methods.

*Hanlei Shi,Leyuan Qu,Yu Liu,Di Gao,Yuhua Zheng,Taihao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the 'Think-Before-Draw' framework for natural emotional talking-head generation by mapping text to actionable facial motions and refining expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve emotional talking-head generation by addressing the oversimplification of real facial movements in text-based methods, enabling more natural and dynamic emotional expressions.

Method: The proposed framework incorporates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for semantic parsing of emotions and employs a progressive guidance denoising strategy to improve expressiveness through a global localization and local control mechanism.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MEAD and HDTF benchmarks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generation capabilities on collected portrait images.

Conclusion: The 'Think-Before-Draw' framework successfully bridges high-level semantics with fine-grained facial expressions, enhancing natural emotional expressiveness in text-driven talking-head generation.

Abstract: Emotional talking-head generation has emerged as a pivotal research area at
the intersection of computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence,
with its core value lying in enhancing human-computer interaction through
immersive and empathetic engagement.With the advancement of multimodal large
language models, the driving signals for emotional talking-head generation has
shifted from audio and video to more flexible text. However, current
text-driven methods rely on predefined discrete emotion label texts,
oversimplifying the dynamic complexity of real facial muscle movements and thus
failing to achieve natural emotional expressiveness.This study proposes the
Think-Before-Draw framework to address two key challenges: (1) In-depth
semantic parsing of emotions--by innovatively introducing Chain-of-Thought
(CoT), abstract emotion labels are transformed into physiologically grounded
facial muscle movement descriptions, enabling the mapping from high-level
semantics to actionable motion features; and (2) Fine-grained expressiveness
optimization--inspired by artists' portrait painting process, a progressive
guidance denoising strategy is proposed, employing a "global emotion
localization--local muscle control" mechanism to refine micro-expression
dynamics in generated videos.Our experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks, including MEAD
and HDTF. Additionally, we collected a set of portrait images to evaluate our
model's zero-shot generation capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in accident anticipation, which include limited high-quality training data and missing object-level cues due to environmental or sensor issues.

Method: The approach involves creating driving scenarios using a world model for scene augmentation and designing a dynamic prediction model that robustly processes spatio-temporal data.

Result: The framework improves the accuracy and lead time of accident predictions, validated through experiments on public and newly released datasets.

Conclusion: This study provides a promising solution to current challenges in autonomous driving safety, enhancing both performance and reliability of accident anticipation systems.

Abstract: Reliable anticipation of traffic accidents is essential for advancing
autonomous driving systems. However, this objective is limited by two
fundamental challenges: the scarcity of diverse, high-quality training data and
the frequent absence of crucial object-level cues due to environmental
disruptions or sensor deficiencies. To tackle these issues, we propose a
comprehensive framework combining generative scene augmentation with adaptive
temporal reasoning. Specifically, we develop a video generation pipeline that
utilizes a world model guided by domain-informed prompts to create
high-resolution, statistically consistent driving scenarios, particularly
enriching the coverage of edge cases and complex interactions. In parallel, we
construct a dynamic prediction model that encodes spatio-temporal relationships
through strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators,
effectively addressing data incompleteness and transient visual noise.
Furthermore, we release a new benchmark dataset designed to better capture
diverse real-world driving risks. Extensive experiments on public and newly
released datasets confirm that our framework enhances both the accuracy and
lead time of accident anticipation, offering a robust solution to current data
and modeling limitations in safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ATARA, a self-supervised framework that collects task-agnostic action data efficiently, and AnyPos, an inverse dynamics model designed for better learning from this data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the limitations of task-specific human demonstrations in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which are costly and restrict scalability.

Method: They developed ATARA for scalable task-agnostic data collection and AnyPos, a model featuring Arm-Decoupled Estimation and Direction-Aware Decoding for extracting actionable insights. They also employ video-conditioned validation to refine learned policies.

Result: Their system achieved a 51% test accuracy improvement and 30-40% higher success rates in tasks like lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking during experiments.

Conclusion: Task-agnostic frameworks like ATARA and specialized models like AnyPos can enhance the efficiency and applicability of VLA systems in diverse manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise on task-conditioned
control in complex settings such as bimanual manipulation. However, the heavy
reliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and
incurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of
task-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from
task-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and
cost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this
paradigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety
risks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a
scalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $
30\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective
learning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution
mismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics
model equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder
(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module
to verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation
tasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%
improvement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in
downstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using
replay-based video validation. Project Page:

*Min-Jeong Lee,Hee-Dong Kim,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReToM, a token merging strategy enhancing the efficiency of Stable Diffusion image generation while maintaining high visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency in Stable Diffusion's image generation due to quadratic complexity in attention operations and to improve upon existing token merging methods that neglect the unique characteristics of attention-based image generation.

Method: ReToM uses local boundaries (windows) in attention inputs to merge tokens, allows window size adjustments, and introduces a representative token selected based on the highest average similarity within a window to ensure critical local features are preserved during merging.

Result: ReToM shows a 6.2% improvement in FID, higher CLIP scores compared to the baseline, and maintains comparable inference time, indicating a balance between visual quality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed ReToM strategy proves effective in enhancing efficiency and quality for attention-based image generation models like Stable Diffusion, making it a potentially valuable tool for balancing computation and output quality.

Abstract: Stable diffusion is an outstanding image generation model for text-to-image,
but its time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the
quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods
improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention
operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image
generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose
local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging
strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge
tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries
as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we
introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative
token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting
the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most
salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental
results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP
scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time.
We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality
and computational efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency of vision transformers by reducing their computational complexity without compromising performance.

Method: Proposed a differentiable channel selection strategy within MLP layers of transformers, guided by a sharp theoretical generalization bound.

Result: KCR-Transformers reduce FLOPs and parameters in standard vision transformers like ViT and Swin while achieving superior or equal performance on various tasks.

Conclusion: KCR-Transformer successfully integrates advanced channel pruning with rigorous theory, yielding computationally efficient vision transformers applicable across architectures.

Abstract: Self-attention and transformer architectures have become foundational
components in modern deep learning. Recent efforts have integrated transformer
blocks into compact neural architectures for computer vision, giving rise to
various efficient vision transformers. In this work, we introduce Transformer
with Kernel Complexity Reduction, or KCR-Transformer, a compact transformer
block equipped with differentiable channel selection, guided by a novel and
sharp theoretical generalization bound. KCR-Transformer performs input/output
channel selection in the MLP layers of transformer blocks to reduce the
computational cost. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis
establishing a tight generalization bound for networks equipped with
KCR-Transformer blocks. Leveraging such strong theoretical results, the channel
pruning by KCR-Transformer is conducted in a generalization-aware manner,
ensuring that the resulting network retains a provably small generalization
error. Our KCR-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact
transformer networks, such as ViT and Swin, and it reduces the FLOPs of the
vision transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction
accuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in the
vision transformers with KCR-Transformer blocks, leading to KCR-Transformer
networks with different backbones. The resulting TCR-Transformers achieve
superior performance on various computer vision tasks, achieving even better
performance than the original models with even less FLOPs and parameters.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SVM-City, the first multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, accompanied by City-VLM, a model for multimodal fusion without explicit concatenation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing indoor-focused LVLMs, including their inability to handle large-scale outdoor scenarios and their difficulty integrating 2D and 3D visual modalities.

Method: Developed the SVM-City dataset with multimodal and multi-view data from diverse outdoor sources, and designed the City-VLM model that uses a joint probabilistic distribution space for multimodal fusion.

Result: City-VLM outperformed existing LVLMs by 18.14% on average in outdoor scene understanding question-answering tasks.

Conclusion: City-VLM and SVM-City demonstrate a significant improvement in outdoor scene understanding, extending the capabilities of LVLMs to handle complex, multidomain environments effectively.

Abstract: Scene understanding enables intelligent agents to interpret and comprehend
their environment. While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face
two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene
understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale
environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g.,
bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze
single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid
viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception
outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual
information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first
multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named
\textbf{\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\textbf{\underline{S}}cale
scenarios with multi\textbf{\underline{V}}iew and
multi\textbf{\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k
images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from
vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To
effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we
introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding
and design the LVLM named \textbf{\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is
realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than
implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation).
Experimental results on three typical outdoor scene understanding tasks show
City-VLM achieves $18.14 \%$ performance surpassing existing LVLMs in
question-answering tasks averagely. Our method demonstrates pragmatic and
generalization performance across multiple outdoor scenes.

Method: The authors adapt DeQA-Score, an MLLM-based image quality scorer, for documents. They use soft label strategies for continuous score regression, relax resolution constraints for processing high-resolution document images, and employ ensemble methods to enhance performance.

Result: Experiments show that DeQA-Doc surpasses existing baselines in accuracy and generalizability across different types of document degradation.

Conclusion: DeQA-Doc demonstrates a cutting-edge approach to assessing document quality, establishing itself as a robust and generalizable solution in this domain, with resources and code publicly available.

Abstract: Document quality assessment is critical for a wide range of applications
including document digitization, OCR, and archival. However, existing
approaches often struggle to provide accurate and robust quality scores,
limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. With the rapid progress in
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), recent MLLM-based methods have
achieved remarkable performance in image quality assessment. In this work, we
extend this success to the document domain by adapting DeQA-Score, a
state-of-the-art MLLM-based image quality scorer, for document quality
assessment. We propose DeQA-Doc, a framework that leverages the visual language
capabilities of MLLMs and a soft label strategy to regress continuous document
quality scores. To adapt DeQA-Score to DeQA-Doc, we adopt two complementary
solutions to construct soft labels without the variance information. Also, we
relax the resolution constrains to support the large resolution of document
images. Finally, we introduce ensemble methods to further enhance the
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeQA-Doc significantly
outperforms existing baselines, offering accurate and generalizable document
quality assessment across diverse degradation types. Codes and model weights

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sage, a method that utilizes semantic guidance to fine-tune foundation models for long-tailed visual recognition using class descriptions and adjusts loss functions to reduce prediction bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the degraded performance in less frequent classes in long-tailed scenarios using foundation models with generalizable representation.

Method: Developed a Semantic-guided fine-tuning approach (Sage) with SG-Adapter to integrate class-specific textual semantics into visual encoder fine-tuning and proposed a distribution mismatch-aware loss adjustment.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed Sage method effectively improves performance on benchmark datasets in long-tailed learning.

Conclusion: Sage strengthens visual-textual alignment and rectifies prediction bias, offering a robust solution for improving long-tailed visual recognition in foundation models.

Abstract: The variance in class-wise sample sizes within long-tailed scenarios often
results in degraded performance in less frequent classes. Fortunately,
foundation models, pre-trained on vast open-world datasets, demonstrate strong
potential for this task due to their generalizable representation, which
promotes the development of adaptive strategies on pre-trained models in
long-tailed learning. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual
encoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder,
overlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we
propose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for
long-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance
derived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process.
Specifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as
semantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder. The
introduced guidance is passesed through the attention mechanism and enables the
model to focus more on semantically relevant content, strengthening the
alignment between the visual and textual modalities. Due to the inconsistent
class-conditional distributions neglected by the existing loss function, the
resulting prediction bias causes performance improvements for the tail class
less than for the head class, even when the multi-modal alignment is enhanced.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel distribution mismatch-aware
compensation factor, which is specifically designed to rectify the prediction
bias caused by the ignored inconsistent distribution based on our theoretical
analysis, and is seamlessly integrated into the loss function. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
Sage in enhancing performance in long-tailed learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing VQA models, which rely on event-centric Q&A pairs that lack broader context, leading to fragmented scene understanding and reduced capacity for generalization and higher-level reasoning.

Method: The authors propose FIQ, which generates fundamental Q&A pairs based on video descriptions to enrich training data and incorporates a VQ-CAlign module that integrates task-specific question embeddings with visual features for better adaptability.

Result: Experiments on the SUTD-TrafficQA dataset show that FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods.

Conclusion: FIQ enhances reasoning and generalization in VQA tasks by addressing the limitations of fragmented scene representation through enriched training data and integrated embeddings, demonstrating superior performance in the field.

Abstract: Video question answering (VQA) is a multimodal task that requires the
interpretation of a video to answer a given question. Existing VQA methods
primarily utilize question and answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal
characteristics of video content. However, these annotations are typically
event-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each
video. The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts,
and descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented
scene representation. This issue limits the model's capacity for generalization
and higher-level reasoning. In this paper, we propose a fundamental question
generation with the integration of question embeddings for video question
answering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability
of the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ
generates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the
training data with fundamental scene information. Generated Q&A pairs enable
the model to understand the primary context, leading to enhanced
generalizability and reasoning ability. Furthermore, we incorporate a VQ-CAlign
module that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features,
ensuring that essential domain-specific details are preserved to increase the
adaptability of downstream tasks. Experiments on SUTD-TrafficQA demonstrate
that our FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
baseline methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MCoT-RE, a training-free framework for Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) that balances textual modifications with visual context, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome limitations in zero-shot CIR methods, such as information loss in sequential VLM-LLM approaches and insufficient use of visual context in MLLM-based methods.

Method: The authors propose MCoT-RE, a framework that generates two distinct captions (modification-focused and context-comprehensive) for filtering and then re-ranking candidate images using a two-stage retrieval process.

Result: MCoT-RE demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, improving Recall@10 by 6.24% on FashionIQ and Recall@1 by 8.58% on CIRR.

Conclusion: MCoT-RE enhances zero-shot CIR accuracy by effectively integrating textual instructions and visual reference, offering a precise and training-free solution.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image from
a gallery using a composed query consisting of a reference image and a
modification text. Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot
methods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable
limitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality
independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal
interaction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text,
without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference
image. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with
re-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes
multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit
modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one
focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual
context. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we
combine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained
re-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning
with the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context
of the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves
state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of
up to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.

### [92] [FAR-Net: Multi-Stage Fusion Network with Enhanced Semantic Alignment and Adaptive Reconciliation for Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12823)
*Jeong-Woo Park,Young-Eun Kim,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAR-Net, a new framework for composed image retrieval (CIR), improves semantic alignment and robustness via multi-stage fusion, outperforming existing methods in retrieval accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIR methods struggle with effectively integrating visual and textual modalities, due to limitations in early and late fusion strategies.

Method: FAR-Net introduces a multi-stage fusion framework, combining an enhanced semantic alignment module for late fusion and an adaptive reconciliation module for early fusion.

Result: Experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ datasets show FAR-Net achieves up to 2.4% improvement in Recall@1 and 1.04% in Recall@50 compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FAR-Net offers a robust and scalable approach to CIR tasks, effectively tackling challenges in semantic alignment and adaptability.

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) is a vision language task that retrieves a
target image using a reference image and modification text, enabling intuitive
specification of desired changes. While effectively fusing visual and textual
modalities is crucial, existing methods typically adopt either early or late
fusion. Early fusion tends to excessively focus on explicitly mentioned textual
details and neglect visual context, whereas late fusion struggles to capture
fine-grained semantic alignments between image regions and textual tokens. To
address these issues, we propose FAR-Net, a multi-stage fusion framework
designed with enhanced semantic alignment and adaptive reconciliation,
integrating two complementary modules. The enhanced semantic alignment module
(ESAM) employs late fusion with cross-attention to capture fine-grained
semantic relationships, while the adaptive reconciliation module (ARM) applies
early fusion with uncertainty embeddings to enhance robustness and
adaptability. Experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show consistent performance
gains, improving Recall@1 by up to 2.4% and Recall@50 by 1.04% over existing
state-of-the-art methods, empirically demonstrating that FAR Net provides a
robust and scalable solution to CIR tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve tracking of small objects in challenging conditions, such as UAV scenarios, where small object size and motion create difficulties in detection and association.

Method: The study introduces a novel dataset of UAV video sequences (SMOT4SB), proposes a new performance metric (SO-HOTA), and organizes a competitive challenge with multiple entries.

Result: The challenge resulted in a 5.1x improvement over the baseline by the winning method, validating the proposed approaches.

Conclusion: Advances in SMOT using the SMOT4SB dataset and SO-HOTA metric demonstrate potential for applications in ecological monitoring and industries like agriculture and fisheries.

Abstract: Small Multi-Object Tracking (SMOT) is particularly challenging when targets

association unreliable. Building on the success of the MVA2023 SOD4SB
challenge, this paper introduces the SMOT4SB challenge, which leverages
temporal information to address limitations of single-frame detection. Our
three main contributions are: (1) the SMOT4SB dataset, consisting of 211 UAV
video sequences with 108,192 annotated frames under diverse real-world
conditions, designed to capture motion entanglement where both camera and
targets move freely in 3D; (2) SO-HOTA, a novel metric combining Dot Distance
with HOTA to mitigate the sensitivity of IoU-based metrics to small
displacements; and (3) a competitive MVA2025 challenge with 78 participants and
308 submissions, where the winning method achieved a 5.1x improvement over the
baseline. This work lays a foundation for advancing SMOT in UAV scenarios with
applications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological
monitoring.

Result: AnyCapModel improves caption quality significantly, with ACM-8B enhancing GPT-4o’s content scores by 45% and style scores by 12% on new and existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The AnyCap Project delivers a holistic solution for improving controllable multimodal captioning, proving its effectiveness across models and benchmarks.

Abstract: Controllable captioning is essential for precise multimodal alignment and
instruction following, yet existing models often lack fine-grained control and
reliable evaluation protocols. To address this gap, we present the AnyCap
Project, an integrated solution spanning model, dataset, and evaluation. We
introduce AnyCapModel (ACM), a lightweight plug-and-play framework that
enhances the controllability of existing foundation models for omni-modal
captioning without retraining the base model. ACM reuses the original captions
from base models while incorporating user instructions and modality features to
generate improved captions. To remedy the data scarcity in controllable
multimodal captioning, we build AnyCapDataset (ACD), covering three modalities,
28 user-instruction types, and 300\,k high-quality data entries. We further
propose AnyCapEval, a new benchmark that provides more reliable evaluation
metrics for controllable captioning by decoupling content accuracy and
stylistic fidelity. ACM markedly improves caption quality across a diverse set
of base models on AnyCapEval. Notably, ACM-8B raises GPT-4o\'s content scores
by 45\% and style scores by 12\%, and it also achieves substantial gains on
widely used benchmarks such as MIA-Bench and VidCapBench.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DINO-VO, a monocular visual odometry system leveraging robust visual features from DINOv2, to enhance generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from addressing robustness and efficiency challenges in learning-based visual odometry systems while exploring the potential of integrating visual foundation models like DINOv2.

Method: DINO-VO incorporates DINOv2's semantic features, fine-grained geometric features, and a transformer-based matcher with a pose estimation layer for accurate camera motion estimation.

Result: DINO-VO outperformed state-of-the-art frame-to-frame VO methods on TartanAir and KITTI datasets, demonstrated competitive results on EuRoC dataset, and efficiently operated at 72 FPS on a single GPU.

Conclusion: DINO-VO significantly enhances robustness and generalization in monocular visual odometry, demonstrating competitive performance against Visual SLAM systems in outdoor driving scenarios.

Abstract: Learning-based monocular visual odometry (VO) poses robustness,
generalization, and efficiency challenges in robotics. Recent advances in
visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and
generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains
limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a
feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its
sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a
salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore,
we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric
features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a
transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable
precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior
detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater
robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy
and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone
DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on
the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while
running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single
GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor
driving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities.

*Ziyi Wang,Zhi Gao,Jin Chen,Qingjie Zhao,Xinxiao Wu,Jiebo Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method called Simulate, Refocus, and Ensemble (SRE) to enhance domain generalization by reducing domain shifts in CLIP using attention refocusing and domain-shift simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of CLIP in domain generalization, where it struggles to focus on domain-invariant, task-relevant regions, leading to suboptimal performance on unseen target domains.

Method: The method includes three components: simulating domain shifts through data augmentation, refocusing the attention of CLIP between source and simulated target domains, and utilizing ensemble learning to improve domain-invariant attention maps.

Result: Extensive experiments show that SRE achieves better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed SRE method effectively mitigates domain shifts in CLIP, improving its ability to generalize to unseen target domains.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a model from source domains and
apply it to unseen target domains with out-of-distribution data. Owing to
CLIP's strong ability to encode semantic concepts, it has attracted increasing
interest in domain generalization. However, CLIP often struggles to focus on
task-relevant regions across domains, i.e., domain-invariant regions, resulting
in suboptimal performance on unseen target domains. To address this challenge,
we propose an attention-refocusing scheme, called Simulate, Refocus and
Ensemble (SRE), which learns to reduce the domain shift by aligning the
attention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing. SRE first simulates domain
shifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated
target domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the
attention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains. Finally, SRE
utilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant
attention maps between the source data and the simulated target data. Extensive
experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that SRE generally
achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods. The code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a self-evolving framework (SE-VLN) for vision-language navigation (VLN) to address limitations in current models' adaptability and reasoning by allowing continual evolution during testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN frameworks leveraging large language models (LLMs) lack the capability to incorporate experiential knowledge effectively and evolve, limiting their adaptability and efficient reasoning.

Method: The proposed SE-VLN framework includes three core modules: (1) a hierarchical memory module for reusing knowledge from previous successes and failures, (2) a retrieval-augmented reasoning module for multi-step decision-making using experiential knowledge, and (3) a reflection module to enable the system to evolve iteratively.

Result: SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen environments, marking significant performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0% over state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets, respectively. Its performance also improved with the growth of its experience repository.

Conclusion: The SE-VLN framework demonstrates the potential for creating self-evolving agents in VLN, offering substantial performance gains and adaptability in unseen environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to
emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent
generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning.
However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning
abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and
thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this,
we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and
proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the
ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it
was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework
was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a
hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into
reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to
retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection
module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the
SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen
environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0%
over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets,
respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with
increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a
self-evolving agent framework for VLN.

TL;DR: The authors introduce SCORE, a new open-vocabulary framework for remote sensing instance segmentation that accounts for scene context to improve recognition, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current remote sensing instance segmentation models struggle with novel categories, dataset generalization, and challenges in aerial imagery like ambiguous objects and landscape diversity.

Method: The proposed SCORE framework employs multi-granularity scene context with Region-Aware Integration (for refining class embeddings) and Global Context Adaptation (for adapting text embeddings using remote sensing context).

Result: SCORE achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks for open-vocabulary remote sensing instance segmentation across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: This research presents a robust solution to enhance open-vocabulary segmentation for diverse remote sensing applications, advancing geospatial analysis capabilities.

Abstract: Most existing remote sensing instance segmentation approaches are designed
for close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel
categories or generalize across datasets. This restricts their applicability in
diverse Earth observation scenarios. To address this, we introduce
open-vocabulary (OV) learning for remote sensing instance segmentation. While
current OV segmentation models perform well on natural image datasets, their
direct application to remote sensing faces challenges such as diverse
landscapes, seasonal variations, and the presence of small or ambiguous objects
in aerial imagery. To overcome these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SCORE}$
($\textbf{S}$cene $\textbf{C}$ontext matters in $\textbf{O}$pen-vocabulary
$\textbf{RE}$mote sensing instance segmentation), a framework that integrates
multi-granularity scene context, i.e., regional context and global context, to
enhance both visual and textual representations. Specifically, we introduce
Region-Aware Integration, which refines class embeddings with regional context
to improve object distinguishability. Additionally, we propose Global Context
Adaptation, which enriches naive text embeddings with remote sensing global
context, creating a more adaptable and expressive linguistic latent space for
the classifier. We establish new benchmarks for OV remote sensing instance
segmentation across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that,
our proposed method achieves SOTA performance, which provides a robust solution
for large-scale, real-world geospatial analysis. Our code is available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces $S^2M^2$, a global matching architecture for stereo matching, balancing accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off in stereo matching models between iterative local search methods (lacking global consistency) and global matching architectures (limited by computational costs).

Method: The proposed $S^2M^2$ utilizes a multi-resolution transformer to enhance long-range correspondence, trained with a novel loss function focusing on feasible matches.

Result: $S^2M^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, outperforming prior methods in metrics and reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: The $S^2M^2$ model successfully combines global matching accuracy with computational efficiency, setting a new benchmark in stereo matching.

Abstract: The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing
across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific
fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search
methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism
inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. On
the other hand, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust,
have been historically rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and
memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching
architecture that achieves both state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency
without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design
integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence,
trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible
matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity,
occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on the
Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods
across most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive
efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VITA introduces a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy for visuomotor control, avoiding separate conditioning modules and using a structured action latent space for efficient end-to-end learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to streamline visuomotor control by addressing challenges like semantic sparseness and shape mismatches while reducing time and space overheads in existing flow matching policies.

Method: VITA leverages latent images as flow sources and constructs a structured action latent space using an autoencoder. Flow matching is supervised with encoder targets and final action outputs, implemented as simple MLP layers.

Result: VITA demonstrates superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art policies in bi-manual manipulation tasks, achieving lower inference latencies (50-130% reduction).

Conclusion: The paper establishes VITA as an efficient, MLP-only approach to flow matching for complex visuomotor tasks, showcasing its ability to simplify architectures while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent
visual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional
flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions
(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like
cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating
time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent
images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action
while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative
modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different
modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data
lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional
visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a
structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,
up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we
supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs
through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss
through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end
learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging
bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and
2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency
by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different
conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the
first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual
manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses reasoning segmentation by introducing HRSeg, a model improving segmentation performance with fine-grained high-resolution perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the limitations of low perceptual resolutions in existing approaches for reasoning segmentation tasks.

Method: HRSeg utilizes two modules: High-Resolution Perception (HRP) for processing high-resolution images and High-Resolution Enhancement (HRE) for refining mask features.

Result: Experiments show that HRSeg outperforms existing models on multiple benchmark datasets, with validated module effectiveness.

Conclusion: HRSeg provides an efficient and high-performing solution for reasoning segmentation by leveraging high-resolution imagery and refined features.

Abstract: The reasoning segmentation task involves segmenting objects within an image
by interpreting implicit user instructions, which may encompass subtleties such
as contextual cues and open-world knowledge. Despite significant advancements
made by existing approaches, they remain constrained by low perceptual
resolution, as visual encoders are typically pre-trained at lower resolutions.
Furthermore, simply interpolating the positional embeddings of visual encoders
to enhance perceptual resolution yields only marginal performance improvements
while incurring substantial computational costs. To address this, we propose
HRSeg, an efficient model with high-resolution fine-grained perception. It
features two key innovations: High-Resolution Perception (HRP) and
High-Resolution Enhancement (HRE). The HRP module processes high-resolution
images through cropping, integrating local and global features for
multi-granularity quality. The HRE module enhances mask features by integrating
fine-grained information from high-resolution images, refining their alignment
with text features for precise segmentation. Extensive ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of our modules, while comprehensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate HRSeg's superior performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeckSense, a lightweight wearable device for head pose tracking using bio-impedance sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an alternative to vision-based head pose tracking methods that may have limitations like line-of-sight dependency.

Method: NeckSense uses bio-impedance sensing integrated with a deep learning framework that incorporates anatomical priors for robust pose estimation.

Result: Achieves a mean per-vertex error of 25.9 mm in head pose estimation, comparable to SOTA vision-based methods.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates that bio-impedance sensing can serve as a viable, compact, and non-vision-based method for accurate head tracking.

Abstract: We present NeckSense, a novel wearable system for head pose tracking that
leverages multi-channel bio-impedance sensing with soft, dry electrodes
embedded in a lightweight, necklace-style form factor. NeckSense captures
dynamic changes in tissue impedance around the neck, which are modulated by
head rotations and subtle muscle activations. To robustly estimate head pose,
we propose a deep learning framework that integrates anatomical priors,
including joint constraints and natural head rotation ranges, into the loss
function design. We validate NeckSense on 7 participants using the current SOTA
pose estimation model as ground truth. Our system achieves a mean per-vertex
error of 25.9 mm across various head movements with a leave-one-person-out
cross-validation method, demonstrating that a compact, line-of-sight-free
bio-impedance wearable can deliver head-tracking performance comparable to SOTA
vision-based methods.

*Mengke Song,Yuge Xie,Qi Cui,Luming Li,Xinyu Liu,Guotao Wang,Chenglizhao Chen,Shanchen Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel emotion recognition method that uses gaze fixation patterns and environmental dynamics via standard HD cameras, enabling unobtrusive, user-unaware analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current emotion recognition methods rely on limited bodily responses or complex sensors that compromise natural behavior. There's a need for scalable approaches that integrate external cues with environmental context.

Method: The method uses HD cameras to capture gaze trajectories and head movements in uncontrolled environments. It models spatial, semantic, and temporal dimensions of gaze behavior without specialized hardware or active user involvement.

Result: The system estimates dynamic gaze trajectories and links them with environmental semantics, uncovering the deeper connection between emotion and behavior.

Conclusion: This user-unaware approach enables scalable, real-time emotion recognition with a focus on human-environment interaction, offering low deployment cost and broad applicability.

Abstract: Emotion recognition,as a step toward mind reading,seeks to infer internal
states from external cues.Most existing methods rely on explicit signals-such
as facial expressions,speech,or gestures-that reflect only bodily responses and
overlook the influence of environmental context.These cues are often
voluntary,easy to mask,and insufficient for capturing deeper,implicit emotions.
Physiological signal-based approaches offer more direct access to internal
states but require complex sensors that compromise natural behavior and limit
scalability.Gaze-based methods typically rely on static fixation analysis and
fail to capture the rich,dynamic interactions between gaze and the
environment,and thus cannot uncover the deep connection between emotion and
implicit behavior.To address these limitations,we propose a novel
camera-based,user-unaware emotion recognition approach that integrates gaze
fixation patterns with environmental semantics and temporal dynamics.Leveraging
standard HD cameras,our method unobtrusively captures users'eye appearance and
head movements in natural settings-without the need for specialized hardware or
active user participation.From these visual cues,the system estimates gaze
trajectories over time and space, providing the basis for modeling the spatial,
semantic,and temporal dimensions of gaze behavior. This allows us to capture
the dynamic interplay between visual attention and the surrounding
environment,revealing that emotions are not merely physiological responses but
complex outcomes of human-environment interactions.The proposed approach
enables user-unaware,real-time,and continuous emotion recognition,offering high
generalizability and low deployment cost.

*Yin Wu,Daniel Slieter,Ahmed Abouelazm,Christian Hubschneider,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating lane detection model performance without ground-truth labels, proposing a new framework, LanePerf, that outperforms prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lane detection in ADAS/ADS systems faces challenges from domain shifts, requiring costly data annotation for robustness. The paper aims to enable efficient performance estimation without labeled data, a relatively unexplored area in lane detection.

Method: The authors adapt previous performance estimation methods from image classification and develop a new framework, LanePerf, that integrates features using a pretrained image encoder and DeepSets-based architecture, addressing limitations like zero-lane detection and significant domain shifts.

Result: LanePerf achieves superior performance on the OpenLane dataset across different domain shifts, with a lower MAE of 0.117 and a higher Spearman's rank correlation of 0.727 compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: LanePerf demonstrates robust and label-free performance estimation in lane detection tasks, enabling more efficient testing and enhancing safety in domain-shifted or complex driving scenarios.

Abstract: Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems
(ADAS) and Automated Driving System (ADS), providing essential spatial
information for lateral control. However, domain shifts often undermine model
reliability when deployed in new environments. Ensuring the robustness and
safety of lane detection models typically requires collecting and annotating
target domain data, which is resource-intensive. Estimating model performance
without ground-truth labels offers a promising alternative for efficient
robustness assessment, yet remains underexplored in lane detection. While
previous work has addressed performance estimation in image classification,
these methods are not directly applicable to lane detection tasks. This paper
first adapts five well-performing performance estimation methods from image
classification to lane detection, building a baseline. Addressing the
limitations of prior approaches that solely rely on softmax scores or lane
features, we further propose a new Lane Performance Estimation Framework
(LanePerf), which integrates image and lane features using a pretrained image
encoder and a DeepSets-based architecture, effectively handling zero-lane
detection scenarios and large domain-shift cases. Extensive experiments on the
OpenLane dataset, covering diverse domain shifts (scenes, weather, hours),
demonstrate that our LanePerf outperforms all baselines, achieving a lower MAE
of 0.117 and a higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.727. These
findings pave the way for robust, label-free performance estimation in ADAS,
supporting more efficient testing and improved safety in challenging driving
scenarios.

### [108] [Federated Learning for Commercial Image Sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12903)
*Shreyansh Jain,Koteswar Rao Jerripothula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Federated Learning dataset for image classification and proposes two new algorithms: Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of Federated Learning-specific datasets and improve model performance and privacy in distributed image classification tasks.

Method: The authors created a new dataset of 23,326 images classified into 31 categories and proposed two Federated Learning algorithms (Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star) centering on different types of client weight-sharing topologies.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star algorithms outperform the existing baseline algorithms on the newly created dataset.

Conclusion: The paper successfully introduces a new dataset tailored for Federated Learning and provides two algorithms that enhance performance and privacy capabilities, contributing advancement to the field.

Abstract: Federated Learning is a collaborative machine learning paradigm that enables
multiple clients to learn a global model without exposing their data to each
other. Consequently, it provides a secure learning platform with
privacy-preserving capabilities. This paper introduces a new dataset containing
23,326 images collected from eight different commercial sources and classified
into 31 categories, similar to the Office-31 dataset. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first image classification dataset specifically designed
for Federated Learning. We also propose two new Federated Learning algorithms,
namely Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star. In Fed-Cyclic, a client receives weights from
its previous client, updates them through local training, and passes them to
the next client, thus forming a cyclic topology. In Fed-Star, a client receives
weights from all other clients, updates its local weights through
pre-aggregation (to address statistical heterogeneity) and local training, and
sends its updated local weights to all other clients, thus forming a star-like
topology. Our experiments reveal that both algorithms perform better than
existing baselines on our newly introduced dataset.

*Tomohiro Suzuki,Ryota Tanaka,Calvin Yeung,Keisuke Fujii*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AthleticsPose, a realistic sports motion dataset, improving 3D pose estimation for sports analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D pose estimation can significantly benefit sports analysis but faces challenges due to data realism and reliability.

Method: The authors developed a dataset with real athletic motions and trained/testing models to measure the improvement in pose estimation accuracy.

Result: Models trained on AthleticsPose reduced MPJPE errors by 75% compared to imitated datasets, showcasing improved accuracy but sensitivity to view and scale.

Conclusion: Real sports motion data is crucial for reliable 3D pose estimation, but limitations exist in analyzing high-speed metrics due to prediction biases.

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimation is a promising, flexible alternative to costly
motion capture systems for sports analysis. However, its practical application
is hindered by two factors: a lack of realistic sports datasets and unclear
reliability for sports tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce the
AthleticsPose dataset, a new public dataset featuring ``real'' motions captured
from 23 athletes performing various athletics events on an athletic field.
Using this dataset, we trained a representative 3D pose estimation model and
performed a comprehensive evaluation. Our results show that the model trained
on AthleticsPose significantly outperforms a baseline model trained on an
imitated sports motion dataset, reducing MPJPE by approximately 75 %. These
results show the importance of training on authentic sports motion data, as
models based on imitated motions do not effectively transfer to real-world
motions. Further analysis reveals that estimation accuracy is sensitive to
camera view and subject scale. In case studies of kinematic indicators, the
model demonstrated the potential to capture individual differences in knee
angles but struggled with higher-speed metrics, such as knee-drive velocity,
due to prediction biases. This work provides the research community with a
valuable dataset and clarifies the potential and practical limitations of using
monocular 3D pose estimation for sports motion analysis. Our dataset, code, and
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/SZucchini/AthleticsPose.

### [110] [Argus: Leveraging Multiview Images for Improved 3-D Scene Understanding With Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12916)
*Yifan Xu,Chao Zhang,Hanqi Jiang,Xiaoyan Wang,Ruifei Ma,Yiwei Li,Zihao Wu,Zeju Li,Xiangde Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Argus, a 3D multimodal framework utilizing multi-view images and 3D point clouds for enhanced 3D scene understanding using foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing 3D scene understanding methods, which heavily rely on 3D point clouds and often suffer from information loss in indoor scene reconstruction.

Method: The paper introduces Argus, a 3D multimodal model that integrates multi-view images, camera poses, and 3D point clouds into unified 3D-aware embeddings for improved Large Language Model (LLM) performance in 3D tasks.

Result: Argus demonstrates superior performance over existing 3D-LMMs in a variety of 3D downstream tasks through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed Argus framework successfully addresses information loss and aids LLMs in better understanding 3D scenes, showing its potential in enhancing 3D scene understanding using multimodal data.

Abstract: Advancements in foundation models have made it possible to conduct
applications in various downstream tasks. Especially, the new era has witnessed
a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling
tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point
clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results
in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone
to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds.
Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of
details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense
reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency
with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene
components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on
these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that
leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In
general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model
(3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D
multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to
tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and
camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features
to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach
compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and
helps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks.

### [111] [DMQ: Dissecting Outliers of Diffusion Models for Post-Training Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12933)
*Dongyeun Lee,Jiwan Hur,Hyounguk Shon,Jae Young Lee,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DMQ, a quantization approach for diffusion models combining novel techniques to maintain performance while reducing computational costs, particularly at low bit-widths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational challenges of diffusion models for deployment in resource-constrained environments, especially at low bit-widths where performance often degrades.

Method: DMQ combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES), channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS), adaptive timestep weighting, and a voting algorithm to optimize quantization and reduce errors in diffusion models.

Result: The proposed method significantly outperforms existing quantization approaches, particularly maintaining high quality and stability at low bit-width configurations like W4A6 and W4A8.

Conclusion: DMQ effectively tackles the limitations of post-training quantization for diffusion models, ensuring deployment feasibility in constrained environments while preserving performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative
nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,
leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a
DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise
Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned
Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute
quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall
quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having
small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error
accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to
prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that
layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we
introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust
selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting
algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths
such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image
generation quality and model stability. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in selecting optimal deep learning architectures for effective and balanced landslide detection using remote sensing data.

Method: The framework combines online and offline data augmentation to address data imbalance, uses an EfficientNet_Large model for feature extraction, and integrates a post-processing SVM classifier for improved classification.

Result: The model demonstrated strong performance with an F1-score of 0.8938 on the Zindi challenge's public test set.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning framework effectively tackles data imbalance and improves landslide detection, proving its utility in remote sensing applications.

Abstract: The use of satellite imagery combined with deep learning to support automatic
landslide detection is becoming increasingly widespread. However, selecting an
appropriate deep learning architecture to optimize performance while avoiding
overfitting remains a critical challenge. To address these issues, we propose a
deep-learning based framework for landslide detection from remote sensing image
in this paper. The proposed framework presents an effective combination of the
online an offline data augmentation to tackle the imbalanced data, a backbone
EfficientNet\_Large deep learning model for extracting robust embedding
features, and a post-processing SVM classifier to balance and enhance the
classification performance. The proposed model achieved an F1-score of 0.8938
on the public test set of the Zindi challenge.

*Yafei Zhang,Lingqi Kong,Huafeng Li,Jie Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a weakly supervised framework for visible-infrared person ReID, addressing the lack of labeled cross-modal identity data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visible-infrared person ReID models rely heavily on labeled cross-modal samples, which are often unavailable; this paper seeks to reduce this dependence.

Method: The proposed framework focuses on heterogeneous expert collaborative consistency learning, where independent classification experts predict cross-modal identities and their predictions are refined via a relationship fusion mechanism.

Result: The method shows significant improvement in modality-invariant feature learning and cross-modal identity recognition, validated through experiments on two challenging datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates that robust cross-modal identity correspondences can be effectively established using weak supervision, enhancing overall model performance.

Abstract: To reduce the reliance of visible-infrared person re-identification (ReID)
models on labeled cross-modal samples, this paper explores a weakly supervised
cross-modal person ReID method that uses only single-modal sample identity
labels, addressing scenarios where cross-modal identity labels are unavailable.
To mitigate the impact of missing cross-modal labels on model performance, we
propose a heterogeneous expert collaborative consistency learning framework,
designed to establish robust cross-modal identity correspondences in a weakly
supervised manner. This framework leverages labeled data from each modality to
independently train dedicated classification experts. To associate cross-modal
samples, these classification experts act as heterogeneous predictors,
predicting the identities of samples from the other modality. To improve
prediction accuracy, we design a cross-modal relationship fusion mechanism that
effectively integrates predictions from different experts. Under the implicit
supervision provided by cross-modal identity correspondences, collaborative and
consistent learning among the experts is encouraged, significantly enhancing
the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features and improve
cross-modal identity recognition. Experimental results on two challenging
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*Yucheng Tang,Yunguan Fu,Weixi Yi,Yipei Wang,Daniel C. Alexander,Rhodri Davies,Yipeng Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a model called MUPM to analyze uncertainties in multimodal large language models, specifically in the medical domain using cardiac MR scans and health records.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and characterize uncertainties from text, image, and combined multimodal inputs in multimodal large language models, which is essential for clinical applications.

Method: The authors propose the Multimodal Uncertainty Propagation Model (MUPM), which quantifies and optimizes uncertainties from different modalities in multimodal inputs, using cardiac MR scans and digital health records as data.

Result: MUPMs are robustly optimized even with limited data and demonstrate transferability across diverse data distributions and tasks. They also enable robust uncertainty estimation for novel clinical tasks.

Conclusion: MUPMs effectively estimate and analyze uncertainties in multimodal inputs, supporting practical clinical applications such as identifying redundant factors and improving cardiac disease prediction workflows efficiently.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can process and integrate
information from multimodality sources, such as text and images. However,
interrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual
uni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an
uncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of
large-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty
propagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the
relationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and
joint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting
of cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be
optimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are
generalisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps
surprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be
explained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,
along with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this
learned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these
uncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may
be estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of
cardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the
efficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty
and its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered
practical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are
available at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM.

TL;DR: This paper presents LoViC, a new framework for generating long, coherent videos by segment-wise processing, using the advanced FlexFormer autoencoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address challenges in producing long-duration, coherent text-to-video content due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention in current diffusion transformers.

Method: Introduction of LoViC framework combining a segment-wise generation process with FlexFormer, an autoencoder compressing video and text into unified latent representations with a variable-length input design for higher flexibility.

Result: The proposed model demonstrated effectiveness and versatility in generating long-form content, supporting multi-shot generation and various temporal tasks.

Conclusion: LoViC successfully addresses scalability and temporal coherence in long-duration video generation, offering a valuable solution within the text-to-video domain.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) for text-to-video
generation, scaling to long-duration content remains challenging due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. While prior efforts -- such as sparse
attention and temporally autoregressive models -- offer partial relief, they
often compromise temporal coherence or scalability. We introduce LoViC, a
DiT-based framework trained on million-scale open-domain videos, designed to
produce long, coherent videos through a segment-wise generation process. At the
core of our approach is FlexFormer, an expressive autoencoder that jointly
compresses video and text into unified latent representations. It supports
variable-length inputs with linearly adjustable compression rates, enabled by a
single query token design based on the Q-Former architecture. Additionally, by
encoding temporal context through position-aware mechanisms, our model
seamlessly supports prediction, retradiction, interpolation, and multi-shot
generation within a unified paradigm. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces cIDI, a DIR framework using Implicit Neural Representations conditioned on regularization hyperparameters to avoid expensive retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning regularization parameters in DIR frameworks is costly and inefficient, necessitating a solution that bypasses repeated training iterations.

Method: cIDI employs INRs conditioned on regularization hyperparameters, trained on their prior distribution and optimized via segmentation masks, producing continuous and differentiable DVFs.

Result: cIDI demonstrates high performance and robustness on the DIR-LAB dataset, validating its effectiveness and integration capabilities.

Conclusion: The approach offers computational efficiency, adaptability in regularization, and precision in deformable image registration through advanced methods like automatic differentiation.

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deformable image registration (DIR) to ensure
that the estimated Deformation Vector Field (DVF) remains smooth, physically
plausible, and anatomically consistent. However, fine-tuning regularization
parameters in learning-based DIR frameworks is computationally expensive, often
requiring multiple training iterations. To address this, we propose cIDI, a
novel DIR framework based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that
conditions the registration process on regularization hyperparameters. Unlike
conventional methods that require retraining for each regularization
hyperparameter setting, cIDIR is trained over a prior distribution of these
hyperparameters, then optimized over the regularization hyperparameters by
using the segmentations masks as an observation. Additionally, cIDIR models a
continuous and differentiable DVF, enabling seamless integration of advanced
regularization techniques via automatic differentiation. Evaluated on the
DIR-LAB dataset, $\operatorname{cIDIR}$ achieves high accuracy and robustness
across the dataset.

*Qiang Wang,Mengchao Wang,Fan Jiang,Yaqi Fan,Yonggang Qi,Mu Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FantasyPortrait leverages a diffusion transformer framework for high-fidelity facial animations, addressing cross reenactment and multi-character challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with facial dynamics, multi-character interference, and rendering fine emotions.

Method: Uses expression-augmented learning and masked cross-attention mechanism for identity-agnostic and coordinated facial animation.

Result: FantasyPortrait outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in single and multi-character scenarios, offering robust and emotion-rich results.

Conclusion: The framework advances expressive animations and introduces valuable resources like Multi-Expr and ExprBench datasets for further research.

Abstract: Producing expressive facial animations from static images is a challenging
task. Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial
landmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and
struggle to capture subtle emotions. Furthermore, existing approaches lack
support for multi-character animation, as driving features from different
individuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To
address these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer
based framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations
for both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an
expression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations
to capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to
render fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked
cross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression
generation, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in
this area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are
specifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating
multi-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in
challenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts. Our project page is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study addresses wrist pathology diagnosis using computer vision, combining fine-grained image analysis and metadata integration to improve accuracy with limited datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosing wrist pathologies remains time-consuming and expertise-dependent, particularly for children with fractures. Leveraging computer vision can mitigate these challenges, but it requires innovative approaches to address dataset limitations.

Method: The study adopts a multi-pronged methodology: treating the problem as a fine-grained recognition task, integrating patient metadata with X-ray images, and using fine-grained pretrained weights instead of coarse-grained ones.

Result: The approach improved diagnostic accuracy, achieving a 2% improvement with a limited dataset and over 10% with a larger fracture-focused dataset.

Conclusion: Incorporating fine-grained strategies and metadata leads to significant improvements in diagnosing wrist pathologies, showing promise in specialized medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who
constitute the majority of fracture cases. However, diagnosing these conditions
is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. Computer vision presents
a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a
notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one
modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse
and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to
address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely
limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained
recognition task, aiming to identify subtle X-ray pathologies that conventional
CNNs overlook. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient
metadata with X-ray images. Thirdly, rather than pre-training on a
coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet, we utilize weights trained on a
fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical
domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies. Our results show
that a fine-grained strategy and metadata integration improve diagnostic
accuracy by 2% with a limited dataset and by over 10% with a larger
fracture-focused dataset.

### [119] [VisionThink: Smart and Efficient Vision Language Model via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13348)
*Senqiao Yang,Junyi Li,Xin Lai,Bei Yu,Hengshuang Zhao,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VisionThink, a method to optimize vision-language models (VLMs) by compressing visual tokens dynamically for improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditionally, vision-language models use an extensive number of visual tokens to improve performance, which is unnecessary for most real-world tasks and impacts efficiency.

Method: VisionThink processes images dynamically, starting with a downsampled version, and uses reinforcement learning to decide when a higher-resolution version is necessary. A reward and penalty mechanism ensures stability.

Result: The method shows strong performance on OCR tasks and reduces token usage significantly for simpler tasks, demonstrating efficiency in computation.

Conclusion: VisionThink offers a novel approach to dynamically compress visual tokens, balancing fine-grained visual understanding with computational savings, supported by reinforcement learning strategies.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved
performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often
significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world
scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the
performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models
still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4
resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with
different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,
namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides
whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output
a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing
Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or
thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by
case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding
capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens
on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge
strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully
design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and
reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available

### [120] [RGB Pre-Training Enhanced Unobservable Feature Latent Diffusion Model for Spectral Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12967)
*Keli Deng,Jie Nie,Yuntao Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an approach to reconstruct hyperspectral images (HSIs) from RGB images using a two-stage pipeline based on an extended RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (LDM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of estimating unobservable spectral features crucial for reconstructing HSIs from RGB images, a significant problem in image processing.

Method: The paper introduces a two-stage pipeline: first, representing spectral structure using a spectral unobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE); second, learning spectral-spatial joint distributions via a diffusion model extended from RGB pre-trained models.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in spectral reconstruction and downstream applications such as relighting tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively utilizes the spectral information while leveraging spatial knowledge from RGB pre-trained models, addressing the problem of unobservable features for spectral reconstruction.

Abstract: Spectral reconstruction (SR) is a crucial problem in image processing that
requires reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from the corresponding RGB
images. A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which
encapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging
sensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial
joint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable
feature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding
RGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB
pre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this
end, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an
unobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding
spatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can
focus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable
feature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers
the ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.
Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure
representation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to
transform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral
unobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress
the unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the
second stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by
the SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively. The ULDM is then acquired to model the
distribution of the coded unobservable feature with guidance from the
corresponding RGB images. Experimental results on SR and downstream relighting
tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

### [121] [Variance-Based Pruning for Accelerating and Compressing Trained Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12988)
*Uranik Berisha,Jens Mehnert,Alexandru Paul Condurache*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel structured pruning method, Variance-Based Pruning, to compress models efficiently and minimize performance drops without requiring extensive retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying state-of-the-art networks in resource-constrained hardware is challenging due to their computational and memory demands. Structured pruning could alleviate these issues, but often entails lengthy retraining periods to recover accuracy.

Method: Variance-Based Pruning involves gathering activation statistics to select neurons for pruning and integrates mean activations back into the model, enabling structured one-shot compression with minimal fine-tuning.

Result: Using Variance-Based Pruning, the DeiT-Base model retains over 70% of its performance directly after pruning and recovers 99% of accuracy with just 10 epochs of fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model achieves a 35% reduction in MACs, 36% reduction in size, and improves speed by 1.44x.

Conclusion: Variance-Based Pruning offers an effective one-shot pruning strategy that compresses networks efficiently, reduces resource demands, and avoids extensive retraining, making it suitable for deployment on resource-limited hardware.

Abstract: Increasingly expensive training of ever larger models such as Vision
Transfomers motivate reusing the vast library of already trained
state-of-the-art networks. However, their latency, high computational costs and
memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment, especially on
resource-constrained hardware. While structured pruning methods can reduce
these factors, they often require costly retraining, sometimes for up to
hundreds of epochs, or even training from scratch to recover the lost accuracy
resulting from the structural modifications. Maintaining the provided
performance of trained models after structured pruning and thereby avoiding
extensive retraining remains a challenge. To solve this, we introduce
Variance-Based Pruning, a simple and structured one-shot pruning technique for
efficiently compressing networks, with minimal finetuning. Our approach first
gathers activation statistics, which are used to select neurons for pruning.
Simultaneously the mean activations are integrated back into the model to
preserve a high degree of performance. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we
demonstrate that directly after pruning DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its
original performance and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99%
of the original accuracy while simultaneously reducing MACs by 35% and model
size by 36%, thus speeding up the model by 1.44x.

### [122] [Differential-informed Sample Selection Accelerates Multimodal Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12998)
*Zihua Zhao,Feng Hong,Mengxi Chen,Pengyi Chen,Benyuan Liu,Jiangchao Yao,Ya Zhang,Yanfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents DISSect, a novel method based on differential-informed sample selection to accelerate contrastive learning in multimodal models, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing cost of training multimodal models on large datasets calls for efficient alternatives like sample selection. Existing methods either rely on oracle models, which don't work well in cold-start scenarios, or use less effective online approaches that poorly handle noisy correspondences.

Method: DISSect introduces a novel approach by leveraging the differential between the predicted correlations of the current and historical models. This differential better characterizes sample quality and filters out noisy correspondences, optimizing training.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and various downstream tasks show that DISSect consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in training acceleration and robustness.

Conclusion: DISSect provides a more efficient and robust alternative to existing sample selection techniques in contrastive learning, making it a valuable contribution to reducing training costs for multimodal models.

Abstract: The remarkable success of contrastive-learning-based multimodal models has
been greatly driven by training on ever-larger datasets with expensive compute
consumption. Sample selection as an alternative efficient paradigm plays an
important direction to accelerate the training process. However, recent
advances on sample selection either mostly rely on an oracle model to offline
select a high-quality coreset, which is limited in the cold-start scenarios, or
focus on online selection based on real-time model predictions, which has not
sufficiently or efficiently considered the noisy correspondence. To address
this dilemma, we propose a novel Differential-Informed Sample Selection
(DISSect) method, which accurately and efficiently discriminates the noisy
correspondence for training acceleration. Specifically, we rethink the impact
of noisy correspondence on contrastive learning and propose that the
differential between the predicted correlation of the current model and that of
a historical model is more informative to characterize sample quality. Based on
this, we construct a robust differential-based sample selection and analyze its
theoretical insights. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and
various downstream tasks demonstrate the consistent superiority of DISSect over
current state-of-the-art methods. Source code is available at:

### [123] [Beyond Fully Supervised Pixel Annotations: Scribble-Driven Weakly-Supervised Framework for Image Manipulation Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13018)
*Songlin Li,Guofeng Yu,Zhiqing Guo,Yunfeng Diao,Dan Ma,Gaobo Yang,Liejun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new scribble-annotated dataset and framework for image manipulation localization (IML), achieving superior performance compared to existing fully supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve annotation efficiency and detection performance in IML tasks, particularly due to the challenges of acquiring high-quality pixel-level annotations.

Method: The authors use a scribble annotation supervision approach, creating a new Sc-IML dataset. They propose a framework with self-supervised training, structural consistency loss, a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM), a gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM), and a confidence-aware entropy minimization loss.

Result: The proposed method surpasses existing fully supervised approaches in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution evaluations.

Conclusion: Scribble annotation supervision is an effective strategy for IML, and the proposed framework demonstrates an innovative and successful approach to enhancing weakly supervised IML tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning-based image manipulation localization (IML) methods have
achieved remarkable performance in recent years, but typically rely on
large-scale pixel-level annotated datasets. To address the challenge of
acquiring high-quality annotations, some recent weakly supervised methods
utilize image-level labels to segment manipulated regions. However, the
performance is still limited due to insufficient supervision signals. In this
study, we explore a form of weak supervision that improves the annotation
efficiency and detection performance, namely scribble annotation supervision.
We re-annotated mainstream IML datasets with scribble labels and propose the
first scribble-based IML (Sc-IML) dataset. Additionally, we propose the first
scribble-based weakly supervised IML framework. Specifically, we employ
self-supervised training with a structural consistency loss to encourage the
model to produce consistent predictions under multi-scale and augmented inputs.
In addition, we propose a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM) that
adaptively integrates prior information from both manipulated and authentic
regions for dynamic feature adjustment, further enhancing feature
discriminability and prediction consistency in complex scenes. We also propose
a gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM) that utilizes gating mechanisms to
regulate information flow during feature fusion, guiding the model toward
emphasizing potential tampered regions. Finally, we propose a confidence-aware
entropy minimization loss (${\mathcal{L}}_{ {CEM }}$). This loss dynamically
regularizes predictions in weakly annotated or unlabeled regions based on model
uncertainty, effectively suppressing unreliable predictions. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms existing fully supervised approaches
in terms of average performance both in-distribution and out-of-distribution.

*Yi Xin,Le Zhuo,Qi Qin,Siqi Luo,Yuewen Cao,Bin Fu,Yangfan He,Hongsheng Li,Guangtao Zhai,Xiaohong Liu,Peng Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MaskGIL, a Masked AutoRegressive (MAR) model that improves efficiency and quality in image generation while significantly reducing inference steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked AutoRegressive models, while efficient, traditionally underperform compared to standard AutoRegressive models, necessitating architectural refinements for competitive image generation performance.

Method: The study evaluates various image tokenizers, introduces a refined Bidirectional LLaMA architecture with bidirectional attention and 2D RoPE, and scales parameters from 111M to 1.4B to develop the MaskGIL model.

Result: MaskGIL achieves a FID score of 3.71 on the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark with only 8 inference steps, while a text-driven variation generates images from text and supports real-time speech-to-image conversion.

Conclusion: MaskGIL matches state-of-the-art image generation quality with reduced inference demands and demonstrates versatility across additional tasks like speech-to-image conversion.

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have made notable progress in image generation,
with Masked AutoRegressive (MAR) models gaining attention for their efficient
parallel decoding. However, MAR models have traditionally underperformed when
compared to standard AR models. This study refines the MAR architecture to
improve image generation quality. We begin by evaluating various image
tokenizers to identify the most effective one. Subsequently, we introduce an
improved Bidirectional LLaMA architecture by replacing causal attention with
bidirectional attention and incorporating 2D RoPE, which together form our
advanced model, MaskGIL. Scaled from 111M to 1.4B parameters, MaskGIL achieves
a FID score of 3.71, matching state-of-the-art AR models in the ImageNet
256x256 benchmark, while requiring only 8 inference steps compared to the 256
steps of AR models. Furthermore, we develop a text-driven MaskGIL model with
775M parameters for generating images from text at various resolutions. Beyond
image generation, MaskGIL extends to accelerate AR-based generation and enable
real-time speech-to-image conversion. Our codes and models are available at

*Jingyao Wang,Yiming Chen,Lingyu Si,Changwen Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Hierarchical Coresets Selection (HCS) method to improve Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for understanding unseen complex wide-area scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address adaptation challenges of current VLMs when analyzing unseen complex and wide-area scenes, which are crucial in the field of scene understanding.

Method: The paper proposes the HCS mechanism, which uses a theoretically justified importance function to refine selected regions based on utility, representativeness, robustness, and synergy, without additional fine-tuning.

Result: HCS enables rapid scene understanding using minimal interpretable regions, enhancing performance and avoiding insufficient feature density. It is also shown to work universally across various tasks.

Conclusion: HCS is a plug-and-play method that significantly improves VLM adaptation for complex scenes, demonstrating superior performance and versatility in experimental tasks.

Abstract: Scene understanding is one of the core tasks in computer vision, aiming to
extract semantic information from images to identify objects, scene categories,
and their interrelationships. Although advancements in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have driven progress in this field, existing VLMs still face challenges
in adaptation to unseen complex wide-area scenes. To address the challenges,
this paper proposes a Hierarchical Coresets Selection (HCS) mechanism to
advance the adaptation of VLMs in complex wide-area scene understanding. It
progressively refines the selected regions based on the proposed theoretically
guaranteed importance function, which considers utility, representativeness,
robustness, and synergy. Without requiring additional fine-tuning, HCS enables
VLMs to achieve rapid understandings of unseen scenes at any scale using
minimal interpretable regions while mitigating insufficient feature density.
HCS is a plug-and-play method that is compatible with any VLM. Experiments
demonstrate that HCS achieves superior performance and universality in various
tasks.

*Yawen Zou,Guang Li,Zi Wang,Chunzhi Gu,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a detector-guided dataset distillation framework that improves upon diffusion models by addressing label inconsistencies and lack of structural detail in synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve dataset distillation methods to generate compact datasets that maintain high performance while reducing storage and computation requirements. Existing methods struggle with label inconsistencies and insufficient image quality.

Method: The proposed method leverages a pre-trained detector to identify erroneous synthetic samples. These are refined using a diffusion model to generate alternatives, with the best candidates selected based on detector confidence and intra-class diversity.

Result: The method synthesizes high-quality images with better details and achieves state-of-the-art performance in validation tasks.

Conclusion: The detector-guided framework ensures label consistency, richer image quality, and diversity in synthetic datasets, advancing the field of dataset distillation.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) aims to generate a compact yet informative dataset
that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset, thereby reducing
demands on storage and computational resources. Although diffusion models have
made significant progress in dataset distillation, the generated surrogate
datasets often contain samples with label inconsistencies or insufficient
structural detail, leading to suboptimal downstream performance. To address
these issues, we propose a detector-guided dataset distillation framework that
explicitly leverages a pre-trained detector to identify and refine anomalous
synthetic samples, thereby ensuring label consistency and improving image
quality. Specifically, a detector model trained on the original dataset is
employed to identify anomalous images exhibiting label mismatches or low
classification confidence. For each defective image, multiple candidates are
generated using a pre-trained diffusion model conditioned on the corresponding
image prototype and label. The optimal candidate is then selected by jointly
considering the detector's confidence score and dissimilarity to existing
qualified synthetic samples, thereby ensuring both label accuracy and
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can
synthesize high-quality representative images with richer details, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on the validation set.

*Riku Inoue,Masamitsu Tsuchiya,Yuji Yasui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Channel-wise Motion Features for efficient motion segmentation, reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance real-time performance in motion segmentation for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving by reducing computational complexity.

Method: Develop a motion feature representation called Channel-wise Motion Features using depth features and 3D motion information, relying only on the Pose Network.

Result: Achieved 4× faster FPS compared to state-of-the-art models on KITTI and Cityscapes datasets with equivalent accuracy and 25% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Channel-wise Motion Features improve computational efficiency and maintain accuracy in motion segmentation tasks, enabling real-time performance.

Abstract: For safety-critical robotics applications such as autonomous driving, it is
important to detect all required objects accurately in real-time. Motion
segmentation offers a solution by identifying dynamic objects from the scene in
a class-agnostic manner. Recently, various motion segmentation models have been
proposed, most of which jointly use subnetworks to estimate Depth, Pose,
Optical Flow, and Scene Flow. As a result, the overall computational cost of
the model increases, hindering real-time performance.
  In this paper, we propose a novel cost-volume-based motion feature
representation, Channel-wise Motion Features. By extracting depth features of
each instance in the feature map and capturing the scene's 3D motion
information, it offers enhanced efficiency. The only subnetwork used to build
Channel-wise Motion Features is the Pose Network, and no others are required.
Our method not only achieves about 4 times the FPS of state-of-the-art models
in the KITTI Dataset and Cityscapes of the VCAS-Motion Dataset, but also
demonstrates equivalent accuracy while reducing the parameters to about 25$\%$.

*Riku Inoue,Masamitsu Tsuchiya,Yuji Yasui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Decoupled PROB, an improved model for Open World Object Detection (OWOD), tackling limitations in prior approaches like PROB by incorporating novel strategies to enhance detection and classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of current OWOD methods, especially challenges like pseudo-label reliance and prediction conflicts in PROB, motivated the development of Decoupled PROB to enhance detection and classification of unknown and known objects.

Method: Decoupled PROB employs Early Termination of Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to resolve prediction conflicts and introduces Task-Decoupled Query Initialization (TDQI) for efficient feature extraction, combining query selection and learnable queries.

Result: Experiments on OWOD benchmarks show Decoupled PROB outperforms existing methods, achieving significant improvements across various metrics.

Conclusion: Decoupled PROB provides an effective solution for OWOD, resolving key issues in previous approaches and delivering enhanced detection and classification capabilities.

Abstract: Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a challenging computer vision task that
extends standard object detection by (1) detecting and classifying unknown
objects without supervision, and (2) incrementally learning new object classes
without forgetting previously learned ones. The absence of ground truths for
unknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have
addressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently
proposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB)
is a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown
objects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces
issues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions.
  To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel
model, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of
Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate
layers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and
objectness predictions in PROB. Additionally, we introduce Task-Decoupled Query
Initialization (TDQI), which efficiently extracts features of known and unknown
objects, thereby improving performance. TDQI is a query initialization method
that combines query selection and learnable queries, and it is a module that
can be easily integrated into existing DETR-based OWOD models. Extensive
experiments on OWOD benchmarks demonstrate that Decoupled PROB surpasses all
existing methods across several metrics, significantly improving performance.

*Han Zhang,Xiangde Luo,Yong Chen,Kang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiffOSeg, a framework addressing variability in medical image segmentation by combining consensus-driven and expert-specific segmentations, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotation variability due to ambiguous boundaries and diverse expertise challenges traditional deep learning methods in medical image segmentation. The study aims to bridge the gap between consensus and individual expert perspectives.

Method: The proposed DiffOSeg framework operates in two stages: Stage I uses a probabilistic strategy to establish a population consensus, and Stage II applies adaptive prompts to reflect individual expert preferences.

Result: DiffOSeg outperformed state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170) across all evaluated metrics.

Conclusion: The DiffOSeg framework effectively addresses the dual needs of consensus-driven and preference-driven segmentation, demonstrating improved performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Annotation variability remains a substantial challenge in medical image
segmentation, stemming from ambiguous imaging boundaries and diverse clinical
expertise. Traditional deep learning methods producing single deterministic
segmentation predictions often fail to capture these annotator biases. Although
recent studies have explored multi-rater segmentation, existing methods
typically focus on a single perspective -- either generating a probabilistic
``gold standard'' consensus or preserving expert-specific preferences -- thus
struggling to provide a more omni view. In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a
two-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both
consensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven
(reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation. Stage I establishes
population consensus through a probabilistic consensus strategy, while Stage II
captures expert-specific preference via adaptive prompts. Demonstrated on two
public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170), our model outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics. Source code is available

*Yuqi Peng,Pengfei Wang,Jianzhuang Liu,Shifeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLAD, a simplified tuning framework for vision-language models, uses LoRA with gradient-based regularization to address overfitting and improve few-shot performance across 15 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt tuning methods for vision-language models struggle with overfitting in few-shot scenarios and often require complex architectures and hyperparameter tuning.

Method: The authors propose GLAD, which applies LoRA for tuning and introduces gradient-based regularization to achieve robust optimization and generalization.

Result: GLAD consistently outperforms prior approaches in class generalization, domain robustness, and cross-dataset performance across 15 benchmarks.

Conclusion: GLAD demonstrates that a simpler approach with regularized gradient tuning can achieve superior generalization, making it more broadly applicable to downstream tasks.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, show impressive zero-shot
recognition ability and can be easily transferred to specific downstream tasks
via prompt tuning, even with limited training data. However, existing prompt
tuning methods face two main challenges: (1) In few-shot scenarios, data
scarcity often leads to overfitting, making the model sensitive to changes in
the input domain. (2) To mitigate overfitting, these methods typically rely on
complex task-specific model architectures and sensitive hyperparameter tuning,
severely restricting their general applicability. To address these issues, we
propose a simpler and more general framework called GLAD (Generalizable LoRA
tuning with RegulArized GraDient). We show that merely applying LoRA achieves
performance in downstream tasks comparable to current state-of-the-art
prompt-based methods. While LoRA is effective and easy to use, it remains
susceptible to overfitting in few-shot learning scenarios. To mitigate this
risk, we introduce a gradient-based regularization technique. This technique
effectively steers the optimization trajectory, encouraging the model to find a
more stable parameter region that is robust to variations in data distribution.
Through extensive experiments conducted on 15 benchmark datasets, we
demonstrate that GLAD outperforms previous tuning approaches in terms of
base-to-novel class generalization, image domain generalization, and
cross-dataset generalization. The code will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated pipeline using deep learning and IVIM-based analysis for assessing fetal lung maturity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the time-consuming manual segmentation process in assessing fetal lung maturity, improving clinical applicability.

Method: The proposed pipeline integrates a deep learning-based segmentation model (3D nnU-Net) with IVIM parameter fitting on diffusion-weighted MRI data.

Result: The segmentation model achieved a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%, and the automated pipeline showed comparable results to manual segmentation.

Conclusion: The automated pipeline provides a viable and efficient solution for assessing fetal lung maturity, enhancing clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Fetal lung maturity is a critical indicator for predicting neonatal outcomes
and the need for post-natal intervention, especially for pregnancies affected
by fetal growth restriction. Intra-voxel incoherent motion analysis has shown
promising results for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung development, but
its reliance on manual segmentation is time-consuming, thus limiting its
clinical applicability. In this work, we present an automated lung maturity
evaluation pipeline for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images that
consists of a deep learning-based fetal lung segmentation model and a
model-fitting lung maturity assessment. A 3D nnU-Net model was trained on
manually segmented images selected from the baseline frames of 4D
diffusion-weighted MRI scans. The segmentation model demonstrated robust
performance, yielding a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%. Next, voxel-wise model
fitting was performed based on both the nnU-Net-predicted and manual lung
segmentations to quantify IVIM parameters reflecting tissue microstructure and
perfusion. The results suggested no differences between the two. Our work shows
that a fully automated pipeline is possible for supporting fetal lung maturity
assessment and clinical decision-making.

TL;DR: The paper introduces R^2MoE, a framework for efficiently incorporating new visual concepts into generative models while avoiding catastrophic forgetting and limiting parameter expansion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for large-scale generative models to continuously learn personalized user concepts without suffering from catastrophic forgetting or excessive parameter growth.

Method: The proposed R^2MoE framework utilizes a mixture-of-experts with routing distillation, a redundancy removal strategy for experts, and hierarchical local attention-guided inference to manage parameter efficiency and concept interference.

Result: Experiments show superior conceptual fidelity in image generation, with a reduction of 87.8% in forgetting rates and 63.3% fewer parameters compared to existing methods on the CustomConcept 101 dataset.

Conclusion: R^2MoE offers an efficient and scalable solution for lifelong visual concept learning, allowing generative models to learn new concepts effectively while maintaining performance and minimizing resource requirements.

Abstract: Enabling large-scale generative models to continuously learn new visual
concepts is essential for personalizing pre-trained models to meet individual
user preferences. Existing approaches for continual visual concept learning are
constrained by two fundamental challenges: catastrophic forgetting and
parameter expansion. In this paper, we propose Redundancy-Removal Mixture of
Experts (R^2MoE), a parameter-efficient framework for lifelong visual concept
learning that effectively learns new concepts while incurring minimal parameter
overhead. Our framework includes three key innovative contributions: First, we
propose a mixture-of-experts framework with a routing distillation mechanism
that enables experts to acquire concept-specific knowledge while preserving the
gating network's routing capability, thereby effectively mitigating
catastrophic forgetting. Second, we propose a strategy for eliminating
redundant layer-wise experts that reduces the number of expert parameters by
fully utilizing previously learned experts. Third, we employ a hierarchical
local attention-guided inference approach to mitigate interference between
generated visual concepts. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our
method generates images with superior conceptual fidelity compared to the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, achieving an impressive 87.8\% reduction in
forgetting rates and 63.3\% fewer parameters on the CustomConcept 101 dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method for anomaly detection in 3D point cloud data using multi-prototype alignment and cluster-wise analysis to achieve precise anomaly localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting subtle structural anomalies in high-resolution 3D point clouds is challenging due to their dense and irregular structure, high computational costs, and sensitivity to spatial misalignment.

Method: The approach involves registering test samples to multiple normal prototypes for comparison, clustering the point cloud using keypoint-guided centroids, and evaluating anomalies by computing cluster-wise discrepancies in feature similarities.

Result: The method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in object-level and point-level anomaly detection on the Real3D-AD benchmark, even with raw input features.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses challenges in 3D anomaly detection, achieving precise localization and improved performance by leveraging keypoint-guided clustering and multi-prototype alignment.

Abstract: High-resolution 3D point clouds are highly effective for detecting subtle
structural anomalies in industrial inspection. However, their dense and
irregular nature imposes significant challenges, including high computational
cost, sensitivity to spatial misalignment, and difficulty in capturing
localized structural differences. This paper introduces a registration-based
anomaly detection framework that combines multi-prototype alignment with
cluster-wise discrepancy analysis to enable precise 3D anomaly localization.
Specifically, each test sample is first registered to multiple normal
prototypes to enable direct structural comparison. To evaluate anomalies at a
local level, clustering is performed over the point cloud, and similarity is
computed between features from the test sample and the prototypes within each
cluster. Rather than selecting cluster centroids randomly, a keypoint-guided
strategy is employed, where geometrically informative points are chosen as
centroids. This ensures that clusters are centered on feature-rich regions,
enabling more meaningful and stable distance-based comparisons. Extensive
experiments on the Real3D-AD benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both object-level and point-level
anomaly detection, even using only raw features.

*Pranav Singh,Pravendra Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel multimodal approach for InfraRed Small Target Detection (IRSTD) by incorporating language priors derived from GPT-4 to enhance detection capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges in IRSTD include target size, sparse distribution in datasets, and reliance solely on the image modality. Motivated by the success of vision-language models, the study aims to leverage language priors for better detection.

Method: A multimodal IRSTD framework is presented that integrates GPT-4-generated textual descriptions with image data. The authors curate a new multimodal dataset and employ tailored prompt engineering.

Result: The proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with notable improvements across metrics like IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa on two benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating textual information with visual data via advanced vision-language models significantly enhances IRSTD, demonstrating the potential of multimodal frameworks in challenging tasks.

Abstract: IRSTD (InfraRed Small Target Detection) detects small targets in infrared
blurry backgrounds and is essential for various applications. The detection
task is challenging due to the small size of the targets and their sparse
distribution in infrared small target datasets. Although existing IRSTD methods
and datasets have led to significant advancements, they are limited by their
reliance solely on the image modality. Recent advances in deep learning and
large vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in various
visual recognition tasks. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal IRSTD
framework that incorporates language priors to guide small target detection. We
leverage language-guided attention weights derived from the language prior to
enhance the model's ability for IRSTD, presenting a novel approach that
combines textual information with image data to improve IRSTD capabilities.
Utilizing the state-of-the-art GPT-4 vision model, we generate text
descriptions that provide the locations of small targets in infrared images,
employing careful prompt engineering to ensure improved accuracy. Due to the
absence of multimodal IR datasets, existing IRSTD methods rely solely on image
data. To address this shortcoming, we have curated a multimodal infrared
dataset that includes both image and text modalities for small target
detection, expanding upon the popular IRSTD-1k and NUDT-SIRST datasets. We
validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and
comprehensive ablation studies. The results demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art method, with relative percentage
differences of 9.74%, 13.02%, 1.25%, and 67.87% in IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa on the
NUAA-SIRST subset, and 4.41%, 2.04%, 2.01%, and 113.43% on the IRSTD-1k subset
of the LangIR dataset, respectively.

*Xiaozheng Jiang,Wei Zhang,Xuerui Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes RS-TinyNet, a novel model for detecting tiny objects in remote sensing (RS) imagery, which outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by introducing advanced feature fusion techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing imagery is challenging due to limited spatial information, weak features, and complex backgrounds. Existing detectors struggle to address these issues effectively.

Method: The authors designed RS-TinyNet, a model with novel components like tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction. They introduced three key modules: (1) Multi-Dimensional Collaborative Attention (MDCA) to enhance object saliency, (2) Auxiliary Reversible Branch (ARB) to preserve data flow, and (3) Progressive Fusion Detection Head (PFDH) to improve feature integration.

Result: RS-TinyNet outperforms existing SOTA detectors, achieving a 4.0% improvement in AP and a 6.5% improvement in AP75 on the AI-TOD dataset. It also shows superior performance on the DIOR dataset across various scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy in RS-TinyNet provides a powerful, effective, and practical solution for tiny object detection in complex remote sensing environments.

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing (RS) imagery has been a
long-standing challenge due to their extremely limited spatial information,
weak feature representations, and dense distributions across complex
backgrounds. Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still
underperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a
multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS
tiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel
designs: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction.
Guided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement
modules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA)
module employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny
objects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive
fusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow
and fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural
detail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our
RS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and
6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior
detection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that
the proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and
practical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.

*Arian Mousakhan,Sudhanshu Mittal,Silvio Galesso,Karim Farid,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a state-of-the-art continuous autoregressive model for long-horizon scenarios in autonomous driving, outperforming discrete token models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of existing world models in autonomous driving that struggle with generalization and performance in long-horizon, challenging scenarios.

Method: A hybrid tokenizer setup was introduced for comparing continuous and discrete token models. The proposed method utilizes a continuous autoregressive model trained on 280h of video data without extra supervision or sensors.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated state-of-the-art performance with only 469M parameters, excelling in challenging urban traffic scenarios and turning maneuvers.

Conclusion: The study finds that the continuous autoregressive model is more robust and effective than discrete token-based models, highlighting its advantages in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Existing world models for autonomous driving struggle with long-horizon
generation and generalization to challenging scenarios. In this work, we
develop a model using simple design choices, and without additional supervision
or sensors, such as maps, depth, or multiple cameras. We show that our model
yields state-of-the-art performance, despite having only 469M parameters and
being trained on 280h of video data. It particularly stands out in difficult
scenarios like turning maneuvers and urban traffic. We test whether discrete
token models possibly have advantages over continuous models based on flow
matching. To this end, we set up a hybrid tokenizer that is compatible with
both approaches and allows for a side-by-side comparison. Our study concludes
in favor of the continuous autoregressive model, which is less brittle on
individual design choices and more powerful than the model built on discrete
tokens. Code, models and qualitative results are publicly available at

*Hongyang Zhao,Tianyu Liang,Sina Davari,Daeho Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a methodology for creating synthetic images using Midjourney to train deep neural networks for construction worker detection, overcoming data limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of insufficiently diverse and voluminous datasets, which hinder the performance of deep neural networks in construction worker detection using visual AI.

Method: A novel image synthesis approach was employed, generating 12,000 synthetic images using 3000 distinct prompts via Midjourney. These images were manually labeled and used for training DNNs.

Result: The DNN trained on synthetic data yielded average precision scores of 0.937 and 0.642 on real construction images, and 0.994 and 0.919 on synthetic datasets, demonstrating both strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: Generative AI offers potential in mitigating training data scarcity for DNNs but has challenges, particularly in ensuring transferability of models to real-world datasets.

Abstract: While recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs) have substantially
enhanced visual AI's capabilities, the challenge of inadequate data diversity
and volume remains, particularly in construction domain. This study presents a
novel image synthesis methodology tailored for construction worker detection,
leveraging the generative-AI platform Midjourney. The approach entails
generating a collection of 12,000 synthetic images by formulating 3000
different prompts, with an emphasis on image realism and diversity. These
images, after manual labeling, serve as a dataset for DNN training. Evaluation
on a real construction image dataset yielded promising results, with the model
attaining average precisions (APs) of 0.937 and 0.642 at
intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds of 0.5 and 0.5 to 0.95, respectively.
Notably, the model demonstrated near-perfect performance on the synthetic
dataset, achieving APs of 0.994 and 0.919 at the two mentioned thresholds.
These findings reveal both the potential and weakness of generative AI in
addressing DNN training data scarcity.

*Keerthi Veeramachaneni,Praveen Tirupattur,Amrit Singh Bedi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using pre-trained visual models for detecting AI-generated videos beyond deepfakes, achieving over 90% accuracy on their VID-AID dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI-generated visual content becomes nearly indistinguishable from real content, detecting generated videos is crucial to combat misinformation, ensure privacy, and prevent security threats. Existing detection methods are predominantly focused on deepfake videos featuring human faces, leaving other types of AI-generated videos under-addressed.

Method: The researchers utilized features from pre-trained visual models trained on real visual content to distinguish between real and generated videos. They employed these features in a linear classification layer for further performance improvement. Their approach doesn't require extensive additional training.

Result: Their method achieved above 90% accuracy in detecting AI-generated videos on the VID-AID dataset, which comprises around 10,000 AI-generated videos and 4,000 real ones from various sources.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates effectiveness in detecting AI-generated videos beyond deepfakes and has the potential to support broader research efforts, with plans to release code, pre-trained models, and the VID-AID dataset publicly.

Abstract: Recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to significant improvements
in the quality of generated visual content. As AI-generated visual content
becomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of
detecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation,
ensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been
substantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for
video detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human
faces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes,
creating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos
with generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that
leverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated
videos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been
trained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can
help distinguish real from generated videos. Using these extracted features, we
achieve high detection performance without requiring additional model training,
and we further improve performance by training a simple linear classification
layer on top of the extracted features. We validated our method on a dataset we
compiled (VID-AID), which includes around 10,000 AI-generated videos produced
by 9 different text-to-video models, along with 4,000 real videos, totaling
over 7 hours of video content. Our evaluation shows that our approach achieves
high detection accuracy, above 90% on average, underscoring its effectiveness.
Upon acceptance, we plan to publicly release the code, the pre-trained models,
and our dataset to support ongoing research in this critical area.

### [139] [Efficient Adaptation of Pre-trained Vision Transformer underpinned by Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13260)
*Yiting Yang,Hao Luo,Yuan Sun,Qingsen Yan,Haokui Zhang,Wei Dong,Guoqing Wang,Peng Wang,Yang Yang,Hengtao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) for Vision Transformers (ViTs), which aims to improve generalization by aligning low-rank weight matrices' properties with those of the pre-trained backbone, achieving competitive results in image classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PEFT methods, such as LoRA and Adapter, do not adopt the approximate orthogonality property observed in the backbone weight matrices, potentially limiting generalization capabilities in downstream applications.

Method: The paper proposes AOFT, which uses a single learnable vector to generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors to represent the down/up-projection matrices, aligning them more closely with the backbone's properties.

Result: Extensive experiments validate that AOFT achieves strong performance on diverse image classification tasks, showcasing improved generalization abilities.

Conclusion: AOFT is a promising strategy for enhancing the generalization capabilities of fine-tuned ViTs by enforcing approximate orthogonality in the low-rank adaptation matrices.

Abstract: A prevalent approach in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained
Vision Transformers (ViT) involves freezing the majority of the backbone
parameters and solely learning low-rank adaptation weight matrices to
accommodate downstream tasks. These low-rank matrices are commonly derived
through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection
matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we
observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within
any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent
in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality
implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error,
signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the
fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as
the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of
fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an
Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the
low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to
generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the
down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices
with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image
classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization
capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiffClean, a text-guided diffusion model to remove makeup for improving age verification and face verification accuracy in the presence of makeup-induced challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of accurate age verification impaired by makeup, which can alter perceived age and identity, to protect underage users from accessing age-restricted services.

Method: The authors propose DiffClean, a novel text-guided diffusion model that removes makeup traces from facial images to mitigate makeup-induced biases.

Result: DiffClean shows a 4.8% improvement in accuracy for minor vs. adult age estimation and an 8.9% improvement in true match rate (TMR) at a fixed false match rate (FMR=0.01%) compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that DiffClean effectively counters makeup-induced challenges, enhancing both age estimation and identity verification, and is more reliable than competing approaches.

Abstract: Accurate age verification can protect underage users from unauthorized access
to online platforms and e-commerce sites that provide age-restricted services.
However, accurate age estimation can be confounded by several factors,
including facial makeup that can induce changes to alter perceived identity and
age to fool both humans and machines. In this work, we propose DiffClean which
erases makeup traces using a text-guided diffusion model to defend against
makeup attacks. DiffClean improves age estimation (minor vs. adult accuracy by
4.8%) and face verification (TMR by 8.9% at FMR=0.01%) over competing baselines
on digitally simulated and real makeup images.

Motivation: Enable realistic, controllable garment visualization personalized via natural language descriptions, addressing limitations in pose semantics and illumination adaptability in e-commerce.

Method: FashionPose is a unified framework that sequentially predicts 2D human poses, generates high-fidelity images with a diffusion model, and applies a lightweight relighting module, all guided by textual input.

Result: The proposed framework enables fine-grained pose synthesis, accurate garment rendering, and consistent, efficient relighting.

Conclusion: FashionPose demonstrates a practical and innovative solution for virtual fashion display, offering a new level of semantic flexibility and visual adaptability.

Abstract: Realistic and controllable garment visualization is critical for fashion
e-commerce, where users expect personalized previews under diverse poses and
lighting conditions. Existing methods often rely on predefined poses, limiting
semantic flexibility and illumination adaptability. To address this, we
introduce FashionPose, the first unified text-to-pose-to-relighting generation
framework. Given a natural language description, our method first predicts a 2D
human pose, then employs a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity person
images, and finally applies a lightweight relighting module, all guided by the
same textual input. By replacing explicit pose annotations with text-driven
conditioning, FashionPose enables accurate pose alignment, faithful garment
rendering, and flexible lighting control. Experiments demonstrate fine-grained
pose synthesis and efficient, consistent relighting, providing a practical
solution for personalized virtual fashion display.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses reproducibility and quality issues in the reasoning-based pose estimation (RPE) benchmark while providing refined ground-truth annotations to improve evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The RPE benchmark has reproducibility and benchmark-quality issues leading to unreliable and inconsistent quantitative pose evaluations.

Method: The authors carefully refined ground-truth annotations through visual matching and fixed issues like image redundancy, imbalance, and ambiguous text.

Result: The refined annotations were publicly released as an open-source resource, enhancing fair and reproducible evaluations.

Conclusion: These refinements aim to improve the utility of the RPE benchmark and allow for more reliable human pose-aware reasoning advancements.

Abstract: The reasoning-based pose estimation (RPE) benchmark has emerged as a widely
adopted evaluation standard for pose-aware multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Despite its significance, we identified critical reproducibility and
benchmark-quality issues that hinder fair and consistent quantitative
evaluations. Most notably, the benchmark utilizes different image indices from
those of the original 3DPW dataset, forcing researchers into tedious and
error-prone manual matching processes to obtain accurate ground-truth (GT)
annotations for quantitative metrics (\eg, MPJPE, PA-MPJPE). Furthermore, our
analysis reveals several inherent benchmark-quality limitations, including
significant image redundancy, scenario imbalance, overly simplistic poses, and
ambiguous textual descriptions, collectively undermining reliable evaluations
across diverse scenarios. To alleviate manual effort and enhance
reproducibility, we carefully refined the GT annotations through meticulous
visual matching and publicly release these refined annotations as an
open-source resource, thereby promoting consistent quantitative evaluations and
facilitating future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cascaded real-time approach for detecting hand-object interactions using streaming egocentric videos, achieving high accuracy and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in detecting hand-object interactions efficiently in real-time applications, which are critical for intuitive user experiences.

Method: A cascaded architecture combines action recognition (using the Mamba model with EfficientNetV2) and object detection (fine-tuned YOLOWorld). Action recognition triggers the object detection module upon predicting a contact state.

Result: The system achieves 38.52% p-AP on ENIGMA-51 for action recognition at 30 fps, and 85.13% AP for hand and object detection.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively detects hand-object interactions in real-time, providing a robust solution for enhancing user interaction in egocentric vision systems.

Abstract: Hand-object interaction detection remains an open challenge in real-time
applications, where intuitive user experiences depend on fast and accurate
detection of interactions with surrounding objects. We propose an efficient
approach for detecting hand-objects interactions from streaming egocentric
vision that operates in real time. Our approach consists of an action
recognition module and an object detection module for identifying active
objects upon confirmed interaction. Our Mamba model with EfficientNetV2 as
backbone for action recognition achieves 38.52% p-AP on the ENIGMA-51 benchmark
at 30fps, while our fine-tuned YOLOWorld reaches 85.13% AP for hand and object.
We implement our models in a cascaded architecture where the action recognition
and object detection modules operate sequentially. When the action recognition
predicts a contact state, it activates the object detection module, which in
turn performs inference on the relevant frame to detect and classify the active
object.

TL;DR: Proposing optimizations for Diffusion Transformers (DiT) to enable real-time video generation on mobile platforms such as smartphones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiT models for video generation are computationally intensive, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained mobile devices and real-time applications.

Method: Proposed innovations include a highly compressed VAE for dimensionality reduction, a knowledge-distillation (KD)-guided tri-level pruning strategy, and an adversarial step distillation technique to reduce inference steps.

Result: Achieved over 10 FPS real-time video generation on an iPhone 16 Pro Max without compromising visual quality.

Conclusion: The study shows it is feasible to perform real-time, high-quality video generation using optimized DiT models on mobile devices.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have shown strong performance in video
generation tasks, but their high computational cost makes them impractical for
resource-constrained devices like smartphones, and real-time generation is even
more challenging. In this work, we propose a series of novel optimizations to
significantly accelerate video generation and enable real-time performance on
mobile platforms. First, we employ a highly compressed variational autoencoder
(VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the input data without sacrificing visual
quality. Second, we introduce a KD-guided, sensitivity-aware tri-level pruning
strategy to shrink the model size to suit mobile platform while preserving
critical performance characteristics. Third, we develop an adversarial step
distillation technique tailored for DiT, which allows us to reduce the number
of inference steps to four. Combined, these optimizations enable our model to
achieve over 10 frames per second (FPS) generation on an iPhone 16 Pro Max,
demonstrating the feasibility of real-time, high-quality video generation on
mobile devices.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve human view synthesis using sparse video inputs by enhancing spatio-temporal consistency with a sliding iterative denoising process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of spatio-temporal consistency in view synthesis videos generated by 4D diffusion models, which compromises quality.

Method: The authors use a novel sliding iterative denoising process on a latent grid encoding image, camera, and human poses, alternating denoising along spatial and temporal dimensions to enhance consistency while optimizing GPU memory usage.

Result: Experiments on DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ datasets show the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches by producing high-quality, consistent novel-view videos.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates effectiveness in improving 4D view synthesis quality and consistency, offering a practical solution for sparse-view human video synthesis.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of high-fidelity view synthesis of humans
with sparse-view videos as input. Previous methods solve the issue of
insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos
at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack
spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this
paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the
spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define
a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human
pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the
latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and
finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised
latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across
the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field
and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory
consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ
datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and
consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing
approaches. See our project page for interactive demos and video results:

Motivation: The authors aim to investigate the instability and errors when generating responses involving complex concepts in visual generation tasks, which is a less explored topic.

Method: The paper introduces the IMBA loss function, an online concept-wise equalization loss, and proposes experiments along with a new benchmark to assess its impact. The method minimizes code changes and does not require offline dataset processing.

Result: Experiments on the newly designed Inert-CompBench and two public datasets show the proposed method significantly improves baseline models' concept response capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed IMBA loss effectively enhances stability and accuracy in conceptual visual generation, showcasing strong performance with minimal implementation effort.

Abstract: In visual generation tasks, the responses and combinations of complex
concepts often lack stability and are error-prone, which remains an
under-explored area. In this paper, we attempt to explore the causal factors
for poor concept responses through elaborately designed experiments. We also
design a concept-wise equalization loss function (IMBA loss) to address this
issue. Our proposed method is online, eliminating the need for offline dataset
processing, and requires minimal code changes. In our newly proposed complex

TL;DR: AutoPartGen introduces an autoregressive model for generating 3D objects component by component, using inputs like images, masks, or existing 3D objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many 3D generation tasks require compositional reconstructions, but existing methods struggle with part-based autoregressive modeling and seamless assembly of parts.

Method: The paper leverages the 3DShape2VecSet latent representation and employs an autoregressive approach to generate object parts one at a time, conditioning on previous parts and external inputs. The process stops automatically when the object is fully assembled.

Result: AutoPartGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in both 3D object generation and part-level generation quality.

Conclusion: The model offers a robust solution for compositional 3D generation, allowing for flexible input modalities and producing coherent, seamless 3D reconstructions.

Abstract: We introduce AutoPartGen, a model that generates objects composed of 3D parts
in an autoregressive manner. This model can take as input an image of an
object, 2D masks of the object's parts, or an existing 3D object, and generate
a corresponding compositional 3D reconstruction. Our approach builds upon
3DShape2VecSet, a recent latent 3D representation with powerful geometric
expressiveness. We observe that this latent space exhibits strong compositional
properties, making it particularly well-suited for part-based generation tasks.
Specifically, AutoPartGen generates object parts autoregressively, predicting
one part at a time while conditioning on previously generated parts and
additional inputs, such as 2D images, masks, or 3D objects. This process
continues until the model decides that all parts have been generated, thus
determining automatically the type and number of parts. The resulting parts can
be seamlessly assembled into coherent objects or scenes without requiring
additional optimization. We evaluate both the overall 3D generation
capabilities and the part-level generation quality of AutoPartGen,
demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D part
generation.

Motivation: Address limitations of conventional visual geometry methods that depend on fixed reference views, which can lead to instability and errors when the reference view is not ideal.

Method: Developed $
\pi^3$, a fully permutation-equivariant feed-forward architecture predicting affine-invariant camera poses and scale-invariant point maps, ensuring robustness and scalability without reference frames.

Result: $
\pi^3$ achieves state-of-the-art performance in camera pose estimation, monocular/video depth estimation, and dense point map reconstruction.

Conclusion: $
\pi^3$ successfully avoids biases from fixed reference views, demonstrating robustness, scalability, and superior performance across various visual geometry tasks.

Abstract: We introduce $\pi^3$, a feed-forward neural network that offers a novel
approach to visual geometry reconstruction, breaking the reliance on a
conventional fixed reference view. Previous methods often anchor their
reconstructions to a designated viewpoint, an inductive bias that can lead to
instability and failures if the reference is suboptimal. In contrast, $\pi^3$
employs a fully permutation-equivariant architecture to predict
affine-invariant camera poses and scale-invariant local point maps without any
reference frames. This design makes our model inherently robust to input
ordering and highly scalable. These advantages enable our simple and bias-free
approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks,
including camera pose estimation, monocular/video depth estimation, and dense
point map reconstruction. Code and models are publicly available.

### [149] [Hierarchical Rectified Flow Matching with Mini-Batch Couplings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13350)
*Yichi Zhang,Yici Yan,Alex Schwing,Zhizhen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores a method to enhance flow matching models, focusing on hierarchical rectified flow matching and proposing mini-batch couplings to adjust complexity across hierarchical levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current flow matching methods face challenges in effectively capturing multi-modal velocity distributions, and the proposed work aims to improve upon the hierarchical flow matching approach to address this limitation.

Method: The proposed method integrates mini-batch couplings into hierarchical rectified flow matching to control the complexity of distributions across levels of a modeled hierarchy.

Result: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed mini-batch couplings through experiments on synthetic and imaging data, showcasing improved performance.

Conclusion: Gradual adjustment of the complexity of distributions via mini-batch couplings enhances the hierarchical rectified flow matching framework for generative modeling, improving its ability to model velocity fields.

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a compelling generative modeling approach that
is widely used across domains. To generate data via a flow matching model, an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward
integration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality
that is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was
recently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically
integrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the
multi-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of
modeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model
multi-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution
remains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how
to gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels
of the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch
couplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on
synthetic and imaging data. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework, VideoITG, that aligns frame sampling in videos with user instructions to improve Video-LLMs. The framework uses an automated annotation system (VidThinker) and introduces the VideoITG-40K dataset for enhanced video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current methods in dealing with long video understanding and to enhance Video-LLM performance by improving frame selection relevance and informativeness.

Method: Introduce VideoITG, which employs VidThinker, an automated system that captions, retrieves, and selects video frames based on user instructions. It also proposes a new dataset, VideoITG-40K, with extensive temporal grounding annotations.

Result: VideoITG, when coupled with Video-LLMs, demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in video frame selection and relevance alignment.

Conclusion: VideoITG enhances Video-LLMs' ability in video understanding by aligning frame sampling with textual instructions, improving video comprehension, especially in complex or long scenarios, and showing significant potential for advanced video analysis and benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that selecting informative and relevant video
frames can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy,
employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing
temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt
unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex
scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding
for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user
instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated
annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process.
First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the
instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through
instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection
to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we
construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed
temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model,
which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities
of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner.
Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements
across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its
superiority and great potentials for video understanding.

*Yiliang Wan,Nitin Shivaraman,Akshaye Shenoi,Xiang Liu,Tao Luo,Jialin Li*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a highly synchronous network to improve distributed system performance, introducing Chora, a co-designed replication protocol.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency and throughput of distributed systems by exploiting synchrony properties in modern data center networks.

Method: The authors designed a synchronized network using kernel-bypass networking and multithreaded architecture, paired with a novel replication protocol 'Chora' to leverage synchronous properties.

Result: Chora demonstrated a performance improvement of 255% over single-leader and 109% over multi-leader protocols in throughput.

Conclusion: Synchrony within data center networks enhances distributed protocol performance significantly, with Chora showcasing the benefits of this approach.

Abstract: Distributed systems, such as state machine replication, are critical
infrastructures for modern applications. Practical distributed protocols make
minimum assumptions about the underlying network: They typically assume a
partially synchronous or fully asynchronous network model. In this work, we
argue that modern data center systems can be designed to provide strong
synchrony properties in the common case, where servers move in synchronous
lock-step rounds. We prove this hypothesis by engineering a practical design
that uses a combination of kernel-bypass network, multithreaded architecture,
and loosened round length, achieving a tight round bound under 2us. Leveraging
our engineered networks with strong synchrony, we co-design a new replication
protocol, Chora. Chora exploits the network synchrony property to efficiently
pipeline multiple replication instances, while allowing all replicas to propose
in parallel without extra coordination. Through experiments, we show that Chora
achieves 255% and 109% improvement in throughput over state-of-the-art
single-leader and multi-leader protocols, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to tackle challenges such as uneven resource allocation, high latency, and insufficient throughput in microservice architectures as system loads and service numbers increase.

Method: The study introduces an intelligent scheduling algorithm using reinforcement learning, where agents interact with the environment to continuously refine resource allocation strategies.

Result: Experimental findings indicate significant gains in response time, throughput, resource utilization, and energy efficiency using the proposed method, especially under varying load scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach enables real-time adjustments in resource strategies, offering enhanced adaptability and optimization compared to traditional methods in dynamic environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based method for microservice
resource scheduling and optimization, aiming to address issues such as uneven
resource allocation, high latency, and insufficient throughput in traditional
microservice architectures. In microservice systems, as the number of services
and the load increase, efficiently scheduling and allocating resources such as
computing power, memory, and storage becomes a critical research challenge. To
address this, the paper employs an intelligent scheduling algorithm based on
reinforcement learning. Through the interaction between the agent and the
environment, the resource allocation strategy is continuously optimized. In the
experiments, the paper considers different resource conditions and load
scenarios, evaluating the proposed method across multiple dimensions, including
response time, throughput, resource utilization, and cost efficiency. The
experimental results show that the reinforcement learning-based scheduling
method significantly improves system response speed and throughput under low
load and high concurrency conditions, while also optimizing resource
utilization and reducing energy consumption. Under multi-dimensional resource
conditions, the proposed method can consider multiple objectives and achieve
optimized resource scheduling. Compared to traditional static resource
allocation methods, the reinforcement learning model demonstrates stronger
adaptability and optimization capability. It can adjust resource allocation
strategies in real time, thereby maintaining good system performance in
dynamically changing load and resource environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses startup overhead in training large language models, proposing a system framework called Bootseer to reduce this overhead by 50%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the increasingly critical problem of startup overhead in LLM training, especially due to its frequency in industrial-scale operations.

Method: The authors conducted a detailed analysis of startup overhead components and developed Bootseer, which introduces optimizations targeting container image loading, dependency installation, and model checkpoint resumption.

Result: By deploying Bootseer in a production environment, the startup overhead was reduced by 50% in LLM training workloads.

Conclusion: Bootseer effectively addresses major startup overhead bottlenecks and offers substantial runtime efficiency improvements in industrial-scale LLM training environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern AI, driving
breakthroughs in natural language processing and expanding into multimodal jobs
involving images, audio, and video. As with most computational software, it is
important to distinguish between ordinary runtime performance and startup
overhead. Prior research has focused on runtime performance: improving training
efficiency and stability. This work focuses instead on the increasingly
critical issue of startup overhead in training: the delay before training jobs
begin execution. Startup overhead is particularly important in large,
industrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams
operate in iterative update-debug cycles. In one of our training clusters, more
than 3.5% of GPU time is wasted due to startup overhead alone.
  In this work, we present the first in-depth characterization of LLM training
startup overhead based on real production data. We analyze the components of
startup cost, quantify its direct impact, and examine how it scales with job
size. These insights motivate the design of Bootseer, a system-level
optimization framework that addresses three primary startup bottlenecks: (a)
container image loading, (b) runtime dependency installation, and (c) model
checkpoint resumption. To mitigate these bottlenecks, Bootseer introduces three
techniques: (a) hot block record-and-prefetch, (b) dependency snapshotting, and
(c) striped HDFS-FUSE. Bootseer has been deployed in a production environment
and evaluated on real LLM training workloads, demonstrating a 50% reduction in
startup overhead.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedGA, a federated learning algorithm aimed at improving fairness across heterogeneous clients by using the Gini coefficient to guide dynamic aggregation weight adjustments, achieving better fairness metrics while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness concerns linked to performance disparities among clients in federated learning due to data heterogeneity.

Method: FedGA uses the Gini coefficient to measure client performance disparities and dynamically adjusts model aggregation weights based on real-time fairness status.

Result: Experiments on datasets like Office-Caltech-10, CIFAR-10, and Synthetic show FedGA improves fairness metrics (variance, Gini coefficient) without sacrificing overall model performance.

Conclusion: FedGA is an effective technique for mitigating fairness issues in federated learning by balancing fairness improvements and maintaining overall performance.

Abstract: Fairness has emerged as one of the key challenges in federated learning. In
horizontal federated settings, data heterogeneity often leads to substantial
performance disparities across clients, raising concerns about equitable model
behavior. To address this issue, we propose FedGA, a fairness-aware federated
learning algorithm. We first employ the Gini coefficient to measure the
performance disparity among clients. Based on this, we establish a relationship
between the Gini coefficient $G$ and the update scale of the global model
${U_s}$, and use this relationship to adaptively determine the timing of
fairness intervention. Subsequently, we dynamically adjust the aggregation
weights according to the system's real-time fairness status, enabling the
global model to better incorporate information from clients with relatively
poor performance.We conduct extensive experiments on the Office-Caltech-10,
CIFAR-10, and Synthetic datasets. The results show that FedGA effectively
improves fairness metrics such as variance and the Gini coefficient, while
maintaining strong overall performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

*Yuxi Liu,Konpat Preechakul,Kananart Kuwaranancharoen,Yutong Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues that some problems in machine learning are inherently sequential and cannot benefit from parallel computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequential problems like reasoning, physical simulations, and decision-making need computational steps that depend on one another.

Method: The authors use complexity theory to highlight the fundamental challenges faced by parallel-centric architectures for inherently serial tasks.

Result: Current architectures relying on parallelism have severe limitations when tackling sequential problems.

Conclusion: Scaling serial computation alongside parallel computation is crucial to advance AI's ability to solve complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: While machine learning has advanced through massive parallelization, we
identify a critical blind spot: some problems are fundamentally sequential.
These "inherently serial" problems-from mathematical reasoning to physical
simulations to sequential decision-making-require dependent computational steps
that cannot be parallelized. Drawing from complexity theory, we formalize this
distinction and demonstrate that current parallel-centric architectures face
fundamental limitations on such tasks. We argue that recognizing the serial
nature of computation holds profound implications on machine learning, model
design, hardware development. As AI tackles increasingly complex reasoning,
deliberately scaling serial computation-not just parallel computation-is
essential for continued progress.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a machine thinking framework inspired by the brain's use of mental imagery to enhance autonomous reasoning and decision-making in AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in current AI models, which fail to reason independently or combine knowledge across domains effectively, unlike humans.

Method: The framework introduces a Cognitive Thinking Unit, supported by Input Data, Needs, and Mental Imagery Units, using data represented as natural language or sketches.

Result: The proposed framework was validated through tests, but the abstract only mentions that results were presented and discussed, without specific outcomes.

Conclusion: Incorporating mental imagery into AI frameworks shows promise for initiating autonomous reasoning and decision-making processes in AI systems.

Abstract: Although existing models can interact with humans and provide satisfactory
responses, they lack the ability to act autonomously or engage in independent
reasoning. Furthermore, input data in these models is typically provided as
explicit queries, even when some sensory data is already acquired.
  In addition, AI agents, which are computational entities designed to perform
tasks and make decisions autonomously based on their programming, data inputs,
and learned knowledge, have shown significant progress. However, they struggle
with integrating knowledge across multiple domains, unlike humans.
  Mental imagery plays a fundamental role in the brain's thinking process,
which involves performing tasks based on internal multisensory data, planned
actions, needs, and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate how
to integrate mental imagery into a machine thinking framework and how this
could be beneficial in initiating the thinking process. Our proposed machine
thinking framework integrates a Cognitive thinking unit supported by three
auxiliary units: the Input Data Unit, the Needs Unit, and the Mental Imagery
Unit. Within this framework, data is represented as natural language sentences
or drawn sketches, serving both informative and decision-making purposes. We
conducted validation tests for this framework, and the results are presented
and discussed.

Motivation: The authors aim to address the high computational cost of MCMC algorithms, which limits their use in large-scale problems and real-world applications. Current solutions either lack hardware flexibility or fail to maintain efficiency across diverse applications.

Method: MC²A employs a co-design approach, extending the performance roofline model to handle MCMC workload diversity, introducing a hardware accelerator architecture with flexible processing units, reconfigurable samplers, and incorporating a novel Gumbel sampler to streamline calculations.

Result: MC²A achieves substantial speedups: 307.6× over CPUs, 1.4× over GPUs, 2.0× over TPUs, and 84.2× over existing MCMC accelerators in various workload evaluations.

Conclusion: MC²A demonstrates that efficient and flexible hardware acceleration for MCMC workloads is feasible, paving the way for its adoption in diverse machine learning applications and domains.

Abstract: An increasing number of applications are exploiting sampling-based algorithms
for planning, optimization, and inference. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms form the computational backbone of this emerging branch of machine
learning. Unfortunately, the high computational cost limits their feasibility
for large-scale problems and real-world applications, and the existing MCMC
acceleration solutions are either limited in hardware flexibility or fail to
maintain efficiency at the system level across a variety of end-to-end
applications. This paper introduces \textbf{MC$^2$A}, an algorithm-hardware
co-design framework, enabling efficient and flexible optimization for MCMC
acceleration. Firstly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} analyzes the MCMC workload diversity
through an extension of the processor performance roofline model with a 3rd
dimension to derive the optimal balance between the compute, sampling and
memory parameters. Secondly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} proposes a parametrized hardware
accelerator architecture with flexible and efficient support of MCMC kernels
with a pipeline of ISA-programmable tree-structured processing units,
reconfigurable samplers and a crossbar interconnect to support irregular
access. Thirdly, the core of \textbf{MC$^2$A} is powered by a novel Gumbel
sampler that eliminates exponential and normalization operations. In the
end-to-end case study, \textbf{MC$^2$A} achieves an overall {$307.6\times$,
$1.4\times$, $2.0\times$, $84.2\times$} speedup compared to the CPU, GPU, TPU
and state-of-the-art MCMC accelerator. Evaluated on various representative MCMC
workloads, this work demonstrates and exploits the feasibility of general
hardware acceleration to popularize MCMC-based solutions in diverse application
domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes IncA-DES, an adaptive method for dynamic data stream classification, addressing concept drift and efficiency issues using local experts, concept drift detection, and an Online K-d tree to improve accuracy and processing time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling concept drift in dynamic data streams poses challenges, particularly as data distributions and availability evolve over time. Classifier fusion has shown promise but requires adaptations for efficient and effective performance.

Method: The authors develop IncA-DES, a system incorporating a local-expert training strategy, a concept drift detection mechanism, an overlap-based classification filter, and an Online K-d tree algorithm for instance management and processing efficiency.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that IncA-DES achieves the highest average accuracy among seven state-of-the-art methods under varying data conditions and boasts reduced processing time, especially when combined with the Online K-d tree.

Conclusion: IncA-DES is an effective framework for adapting to concept drift and improving processing efficiency in data streams, with performance gains validated in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods. The framework is made publicly available for further application.

Abstract: Data streams pose challenges not usually encountered in batch-based ML. One
of them is concept drift, which is characterized by the change in data
distribution over time. Among many approaches explored in literature, the
fusion of classifiers has been showing good results and is getting growing
attention. DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an
efficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid
to adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order
to create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may
become prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data. In this work, we
propose IncA-DES, which employs a training strategy that promotes the
generation of local experts with the assumption that different regions of the
feature space become available with time. Additionally, the fusion of a concept
drift detector supports the maintenance of information and adaptation to a new
concept. An overlap-based classification filter is also employed in order to
avoid using the DS method when there is a consensus in the neighborhood, a
strategy that we argue every DS method should employ, as it was shown to make
them more applicable and quicker. Moreover, aiming to reduce the processing
time of the kNN, we propose an Online K-d tree algorithm, which can quickly
remove instances without becoming inconsistent and deals with unbalancing
concerns that may occur in data streams. Experimental results showed that the
proposed framework got the best average accuracy compared to seven
state-of-the-art methods considering different levels of label availability and
presented the smaller processing time between the most accurate methods.
Additionally, the fusion with the Online K-d tree has improved processing time
with a negligible loss in accuracy. We have made our framework available in an
online repository.

Method: The authors proposed two new activation functions, SmoothSplit and ParametricSplit, which include topology-cutting capabilities to better transform data manifolds.

Result: Experiments showed that ParametricSplit outperforms traditional activation functions in low-dimensional settings while staying competitive in higher dimensions.

Conclusion: Topology-aware activation functions like ParametricSplit have the potential to improve neural network architecture performance, particularly in handling topological transformations.

Motivation: Traditional drug discovery methods do not utilize the unstructured text describing biological mechanisms and assay protocols effectively, leaving untapped potential for data-driven drug discovery approaches.

Method: Assay2Mol employs a large language model to analyze existing assay records related to targets of interest, performing in-context learning to generate candidate molecules based on screening data.

Result: Assay2Mol exceeds the performance of existing machine learning methods for generating ligand molecules tailored to protein structures and suggests molecules that are more practical for synthesis.

Conclusion: By utilizing unstructured assay data, Assay2Mol introduces a groundbreaking approach to early-stage drug discovery, enhancing molecule generation and synthesizability compared to prior techniques.

Abstract: Scientific databases aggregate vast amounts of quantitative data alongside
descriptive text. In biochemistry, molecule screening assays evaluate the
functional responses of candidate molecules against disease targets.
Unstructured text that describes the biological mechanisms through which these
targets operate, experimental screening protocols, and other attributes of
assays offer rich information for new drug discovery campaigns but has been
untapped because of that unstructured format. We present Assay2Mol, a large
language model-based workflow that can capitalize on the vast existing
biochemical screening assays for early-stage drug discovery. Assay2Mol
retrieves existing assay records involving targets similar to the new target
and generates candidate molecules using in-context learning with the retrieved
assay screening data. Assay2Mol outperforms recent machine learning approaches
that generate candidate ligand molecules for target protein structures, while
also promoting more synthesizable molecule generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the challenge of clustering ranking vectors while ensuring centroids belong to the same set, relevant for personalization and large-scale decision-making.

Method: The authors establish the NP-hardness of KRC, derive analytical solutions for single-cluster centroids, and propose KRCA, an iterative approximation algorithm enhanced with a branch-and-bound method for efficient computation.

Result: KRCA consistently achieves better clustering results than traditional methods with faster computational times, supported by both synthetic and real-world data experiments.

Conclusion: The paper provides theoretical insights and practical tools for clustering ranking vectors, paving the way for further advancements in related clustering problems and applications.

Abstract: We study the problem of clustering ranking vectors, where each vector
represents preferences as an ordered list of distinct integers. Specifically,
we focus on the k-centroids ranking vectors clustering problem (KRC), which
aims to partition a set of ranking vectors into k clusters and identify the
centroid of each cluster. Unlike classical k-means clustering (KMC), KRC
constrains both the observations and centroids to be ranking vectors. We
establish the NP-hardness of KRC and characterize its feasible set. For the
single-cluster case, we derive a closed-form analytical solution for the
optimal centroid, which can be computed in linear time. To address the
computational challenges of KRC, we develop an efficient approximation
algorithm, KRCA, which iteratively refines initial solutions from KMC, referred
to as the baseline solution. Additionally, we introduce a branch-and-bound
(BnB) algorithm for efficient cluster reconstruction within KRCA, leveraging a
decision tree framework to reduce computational time while incorporating a
controlling parameter to balance solution quality and efficiency. We establish
theoretical error bounds for KRCA and BnB. Through extensive numerical
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that KRCA
consistently outperforms baseline solutions, delivering significant
improvements in solution quality with fast computational times. This work
highlights the practical significance of KRC for personalization and
large-scale decision making, offering methodological advancements and insights

### [163] [Second-Order Bounds for [0,1]-Valued Regression via Betting Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12584)
*Yinan Li,Kwang-Sung Jun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel loss function called 'betting loss' for [0,1]-valued regression. It achieves variance-adaptive second-order generalization bounds, improving upon first-order bounds without requiring knowledge of label variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore improved generalization bounds for [0,1]-valued regression tasks, building on prior work in cost-sensitive classification. They seek a loss function that performs better under conditions of varying label variance.

Method: The authors first establish that log loss minimization achieves first-order bounds for regression problems. They then develop and propose a new loss function, the 'betting loss,' which provides variance-dependent (second-order) generalization bounds without explicitly modeling label variance or its distribution.

Result: The 'betting loss' achieves variance-adaptive bounds that strictly improve upon first-order bounds and do so without requiring knowledge of variance, unlike other methods such as distributional reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the betting loss provides an efficient mechanism for achieving second-order generalization bounds in regression, marking a significant improvement over existing techniques and offering practical benefits in variance-adaptive settings.

Abstract: We consider the $[0,1]$-valued regression problem in the i.i.d. setting. In a
related problem called cost-sensitive classification, \citet{foster21efficient}
have shown that the log loss minimizer achieves an improved generalization
bound compared to that of the squared loss minimizer in the sense that the
bound scales with the cost of the best classifier, which can be arbitrarily
small depending on the problem at hand. Such a result is often called a
first-order bound. For $[0,1]$-valued regression, we first show that the log
loss minimizer leads to a similar first-order bound. We then ask if there
exists a loss function that achieves a variance-dependent bound (also known as
a second order bound), which is a strict improvement upon first-order bounds.
We answer this question in the affirmative by proposing a novel loss function
called the betting loss. Our result is ``variance-adaptive'' in the sense that
the bound is attained \textit{without any knowledge about the variance}, which
is in contrast to modeling label (or reward) variance or the label distribution
itself explicitly as part of the function class such as distributional
reinforcement learning.

### [164] [Are encoders able to learn landmarkers for warm-starting of Hyperparameter Optimization?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12604)
*Antoni Zajko,Katarzyna Woźnica*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two new methods for representing heterogeneous tabular data aimed at improving meta-learning, specifically Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) warm-starting. The methods focus on leveraging landmarkers but show limited performance gains in HPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular representation learning for meta-learning tasks, such as warm-starting Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO), lacks tailored solutions, motivating the need for specialized approaches.

Method: Two methods are proposed: deep metric learning and landmarkers reconstruction, both enforcing representations to capture the properties of landmarkers. They are evaluated using meta-task performance and alignment with proposed requirements.

Result: Experiments indicate the encoders align well with landmarker-based representation but do not yield significant improvements in HPO warm-starting performance.

Conclusion: While the tailored approaches achieve landmarker-aligned representations, they highlight the complexity of translating such representations directly into gains for HPO warm-starting.

Abstract: Effectively representing heterogeneous tabular datasets for meta-learning
purposes is still an open problem. Previous approaches rely on representations
that are intended to be universal. This paper proposes two novel methods for
tabular representation learning tailored to a specific meta-task -
warm-starting Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization. Both follow the specific
requirement formulated by ourselves that enforces representations to capture
the properties of landmarkers. The first approach involves deep metric
learning, while the second one is based on landmarkers reconstruction. We
evaluate the proposed encoders in two ways. Next to the gain in the target
meta-task, we also use the degree of fulfillment of the proposed requirement as
the evaluation metric. Experiments demonstrate that while the proposed encoders
can effectively learn representations aligned with landmarkers, they may not
directly translate to significant performance gains in the meta-task of HPO
warm-starting.

*Prateek Chanda,Saral Sureka,Parth Pratim Chatterjee,Krishnateja Killamsetty,Nikhil Shivakumar Nayak,Ganesh Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TASKPGM proposes a scalable optimization framework for finetuning LLMs by systematically selecting task proportions, outperforming traditional sampling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting the optimal blend of task datasets for finetuning LLMs has been a heuristic-driven and manual process, which hinders achieving optimal performance.

Method: TASKPGM uses a principled approach by minimizing an energy function over a Markov Random Field (MRF), incorporating task relationships via behavioral divergences like Jensen Shannon Divergence and Pointwise Mutual Information.

Result: TASKPGM consistently improves performance on Llama 2 and Mistral across various evaluation suites such as MMLU and BIGBench, while also offering insights into task influence and mixture composition.

Conclusion: TASKPGM enhances efficiency and robustness in LLM finetuning while providing interpretable insights, making it a valuable tool for optimizing task mixtures.

Abstract: The performance of finetuned large language models (LLMs) hinges critically
on the composition of the training mixture. However, selecting an optimal blend
of task datasets remains a largely manual, heuristic driven process, with
practitioners often relying on uniform or size based sampling strategies. We
introduce TASKPGM, a principled and scalable framework for mixture optimization
that selects continuous task proportions by minimizing an energy function over
a Markov Random Field (MRF). Task relationships are modeled using behavioral
divergences such as Jensen Shannon Divergence and Pointwise Mutual Information
computed from the predictive distributions of single task finetuned models. Our
method yields a closed form solution under simplex constraints and provably
balances representativeness and diversity among tasks. We provide theoretical
guarantees, including weak submodularity for budgeted variants, and demonstrate
consistent empirical improvements on Llama 2 and Mistral across evaluation
suites such as MMLU and BIGBench. Beyond performance, TASKPGM offers
interpretable insights into task influence and mixture composition, making it a
powerful tool for efficient and robust LLM finetuning.

### [166] [Reasoning-Finetuning Repurposes Latent Representations in Base Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12638)
*Jake Ward,Chuqiao Lin,Constantin Venhoff,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores how backtracking behavior in reasoning models is influenced by pre-existing directions in the base model's residual stream, without learning new capabilities from scratch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanism behind backtracking in reasoning models and how fine-tuning repurposes pre-existing model representations.

Method: The researchers investigated DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B's activation residuals using steering vectors from its base model, Llama-3.1-8B, and analyzed their effects on inducing backtracking.

Result: A specific direction in the base model was identified that drives backtracking when applied to the reasoning model, though it does not induce such a response in the base model itself.

Conclusion: Reasoning models likely repurpose base model representations during finetuning to create new behavioral circuits rather than developing new mechanisms from scratch.

Abstract: Backtracking, an emergent behavior elicited by reasoning fine-tuning, has
been shown to be a key mechanism in reasoning models' enhanced capabilities.
Prior work has succeeded in manipulating this behavior via steering vectors,
but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In this work, we show
that the emergence of backtracking in DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B is in part
driven by a repurposed direction already present in base model activations.
Specifically, we identify a direction in base Llama-3.1-8B's residual stream
which systematically induces backtracking when used to steer the distilled
reasoning model, and find that the effects of steering with this direction
cannot be trivially explained by token-level attributes. We further find that
this direction does not induce backtracking in the base model, suggesting that
the reasoning finetuning process repurposes pre-existing representations to
form new behavioral circuits. Additionally, we hypothesize that this direction
is one of several which may work together to mediate backtracking. Our findings
offer a compelling picture that reasoning-finetuned models repurpose
pre-existing base model representations, rather than learn new capabilities
from scratch.

### [167] [Improving physics-informed neural network extrapolation via transfer learning and adaptive activation functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12659)
*Athanasios Papastathopoulos-Katsaros,Alexandra Stavrianidi,Zhandong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a transfer learning method and adaptive activation functions to improve PINNs' extrapolation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs struggle with extrapolation and sensitivity to activation functions, hindering their reliability in broader scientific problem-solving.

Method: The authors employ transfer learning within extended domains using adaptive activation functions to enhance model robustness and accuracy.

Result: Experimental results show a 40% reduction in relative L2 error and a 50% reduction in mean absolute error during extrapolation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly improves PINNs' predictive accuracy and robustness without increasing computational cost.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are deep learning models that
incorporate the governing physical laws of a system into the learning process,
making them well-suited for solving complex scientific and engineering
problems. Recently, PINNs have gained widespread attention as a powerful
framework for combining physical principles with data-driven modeling to
improve prediction accuracy. Despite their successes, however, PINNs often
exhibit poor extrapolation performance outside the training domain and are
highly sensitive to the choice of activation functions (AFs). In this paper, we
introduce a transfer learning (TL) method to improve the extrapolation
capability of PINNs. Our approach applies transfer learning (TL) within an
extended training domain, using only a small number of carefully selected
collocation points. Additionally, we propose an adaptive AF that takes the form
of a linear combination of standard AFs, which improves both the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our
method achieves an average of 40% reduction in relative L2 error and an average
of 50% reduction in mean absolute error in the extrapolation domain, all
without a significant increase in computational cost. The code is available at

### [168] [Federated Learning in Open- and Closed-Loop EMG Decoding: A Privacy and Performance Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12652)
*Kai Malcolm,César Uribe,Momona Yamagami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Federated Learning (FL) for enhancing privacy in neural decoding tasks, particularly highlighting its strengths and limitations in open-loop and closed-loop scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in data sharing for decoder training in neural interfaces while maintaining high-performance neural decoding.

Method: The study introduces FL-based neural decoding and evaluates its performance and privacy using high-dimensional electromyography signals in open-loop and closed-loop scenarios.

Result: FL outperformed local learning in open-loop scenarios, but in closed-loop studies, local learning surpassed adapted FL methods in performance, albeit with higher privacy risks.

Conclusion: There exists a performance-privacy tradeoff in real-time adaptive applications, and FL methods need further development for single-user, co-adaptive scenarios.

Abstract: Invasive and non-invasive neural interfaces hold promise as high-bandwidth
input devices for next-generation technologies. However, neural signals
inherently encode sensitive information about an individual's identity and
health, making data sharing for decoder training a critical privacy challenge.
Federated learning (FL), a distributed, privacy-preserving learning framework,
presents a promising solution, but it remains unexplored in closed-loop
adaptive neural interfaces. Here, we introduce FL-based neural decoding and
systematically evaluate its performance and privacy using high-dimensional
electromyography signals in both open- and closed-loop scenarios. In open-loop
simulations, FL significantly outperformed local learning baselines,
demonstrating its potential for high-performance, privacy-conscious neural
decoding. In contrast, closed-loop user studies required adapting FL methods to
accommodate single-user, real-time interactions, a scenario not supported by
standard FL. This modification resulted in local learning decoders surpassing
the adapted FL approach in closed-loop performance, yet local learning still
carried higher privacy risks. Our findings highlight a critical
performance-privacy tradeoff in real-time adaptive applications and indicate
the need for FL methods specifically designed for co-adaptive, single-user
applications.

### [169] [A Kernel Distribution Closeness Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12843)
*Zhijian Zhou,Liuhua Peng,Xunye Tian,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes norm-adaptive MMD (NAMMD) as an enhancement to maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) for improved distribution closeness testing (DCT) and demonstrates its theoretical and experimental advantages over MMD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DCT methods focus on discrepancies in discrete, one-dimensional spaces, limiting their applicability to complex data types such as images, and MMD is less informative for assessing closeness levels across multiple pairs of distributions.

Method: The authors introduce NAMMD, a novel measurement scaling MMD values using the RKHS norms of distributions, and propose NAMMD-based DCT leveraging its asymptotic distribution for effectively assessing distribution closeness.

Result: NAMMD-based DCT is shown to have higher test power and bounded type-I error compared to MMD-based DCT, validated through extensive experiments across various data types, and it also improves the two-sample testing problem.

Conclusion: NAMMD enhances the capability and test power of MMD for both distribution closeness testing and two-sample testing, providing a theoretically robust and experimentally validated approach for complex data types.

Abstract: The distribution closeness testing (DCT) assesses whether the distance
between a distribution pair is at least $\epsilon$-far. Existing DCT methods
mainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete
one-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their
applications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of
data, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful
measurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex
distributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the
same for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when
assessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the
issue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive
MMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions.
Based on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the
NAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair.
Theoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to
MMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive
experiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images).
Furthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample
testing problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than
the MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing complexities arising from data heterogeneity, especially due to differences in formats, and the lack of comprehensive reviews on modern data transformation strategies for AI.

Method: The paper explores, categorizes, and systematically reviews various strategies to address data heterogeneity caused by format disparities, focusing on their implications for data preparation and transformation.

Result: The survey offers a structured categorization of data transformation strategies, pinpointing key challenges and their potential impact on AI model training and performance.

Conclusion: This work underscores the importance of tailored data transformation approaches to tackle data heterogeneity and enhance the efficiency of AI model learning and adaptability to diverse input formats.

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a prevalent issue, stemming from various conflicting
factors, making its utilization complex. This uncertainty, particularly
resulting from disparities in data formats, frequently necessitates the
involvement of experts to find resolutions. Current methodologies primarily
address conflicts related to data structures and schemas, often overlooking the
pivotal role played by data transformation. As the utilization of artificial
intelligence (AI) continues to expand, there is a growing demand for a more
streamlined data preparation process, and data transformation becomes
paramount. It customizes training data to enhance AI learning efficiency and
adapts input formats to suit diverse AI models. Selecting an appropriate
transformation technique is paramount in preserving crucial data details.
Despite the widespread integration of AI across various industries,
comprehensive reviews concerning contemporary data transformation approaches
are scarce. This survey explores the intricacies of data heterogeneity and its
underlying sources. It systematically categorizes and presents strategies to
address heterogeneity stemming from differences in data formats, shedding light
on the inherent challenges associated with each strategy.

TL;DR: PinFM is a foundational transformer model with 20B+ parameters that improves recommendations by analyzing user activity sequences across various platforms. It achieves scalability, handles new items, and boosts engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a scalable, efficient model for analyzing user activity sequences in billion-scale recommender systems while addressing industrial constraints like cost, latency, and unseen items.

Method: Pretrain a 20B+ parameter transformer on user activity data, fine-tune it for specific applications, and employ optimizations like the Deduplicated Cross-Attention Transformer to enhance efficiency.

Result: PinFM achieves a 600% throughput improvement, increases engagement with new items by 20%, and is deployed across applications for half a billion users.

Conclusion: PinFM significantly enhances the scalability and adaptability of recommender systems, demonstrating its utility in improving user experiences at scale.

Abstract: User activity sequences have emerged as one of the most important signals in
recommender systems. We present a foundational model, PinFM, for understanding
user activity sequences across multiple applications at a billion-scale visual
discovery platform. We pretrain a transformer model with 20B+ parameters using
extensive user activity data, then fine-tune it for specific applications,
efficiently coupling it with existing models. While this
pretraining-and-fine-tuning approach has been popular in other domains, such as
Vision and NLP, its application in industrial recommender systems presents
numerous challenges. The foundational model must be scalable enough to score
millions of items every second while meeting tight cost and latency constraints
imposed by these systems. Additionally, it should capture the interactions
between user activities and other features and handle new items that were not
present during the pretraining stage.
  We developed innovative techniques to address these challenges. Our
infrastructure and algorithmic optimizations, such as the Deduplicated
Cross-Attention Transformer (DCAT), improved our throughput by 600% on
Pinterest internal data. We demonstrate that PinFM can learn interactions
between user sequences and candidate items by altering input sequences, leading
to a 20% increase in engagement with new items. PinFM is now deployed to help
improve the experience of more than a half billion users across various
applications.

Method: The authors develop a continuous-time, matrix-valued SDE framework that connects SGD dynamics to the macroscopic evolution of singular-value spectra, deriving exact equations and validating them through experiments on transformers and MLPs.

Result: The derived SDEs show squared singular values following Dyson Brownian motion with eigenvalue repulsion and stationary distributions taking gamma-type densities with power-law tails, supported by experiments that confirm alignment between theoretical predictions and observed data.

Conclusion: The study offers a rigorous explanation for the 'bulk+tail' spectral structure in trained networks, enhancing theoretical understanding of why deep learning is effective.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have revolutionized machine learning, yet their training
dynamics remain theoretically unclear-we develop a continuous-time,
matrix-valued stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework that rigorously
connects the microscopic dynamics of SGD to the macroscopic evolution of
singular-value spectra in weight matrices. We derive exact SDEs showing that
squared singular values follow Dyson Brownian motion with eigenvalue repulsion,
and characterize stationary distributions as gamma-type densities with
power-law tails, providing the first theoretical explanation for the
empirically observed 'bulk+tail' spectral structure in trained networks.
Through controlled experiments on transformer and MLP architectures, we

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dynamic dataset pruning framework leveraging multimodal models to select relevant training samples based on difficulty and semantic consistency, improving efficiency and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep models suffer from data quality inconsistencies and redundancies, and existing data pruning methods are limited in robustness and adaptability across domains.

Method: The authors propose a framework that dynamically prunes datasets by evaluating training samples using adaptive task difficulty and semantic consistency derived from multimodal foundation models.

Result: The new framework filters uninformative samples effectively, capturing training dynamics and improving cross-domain robustness through supervision from pretrained multimodal models.

Conclusion: The integration of cross-modality alignment in dataset pruning demonstrates a promising direction for enhancing data-centric learning efficiency and robustness in diverse applications.

Abstract: Modern deep models are trained on large real-world datasets, where data
quality varies and redundancy is common. Data-centric approaches such as
dataset pruning have shown promise in improving training efficiency and model
performance. However, most existing methods rely on static heuristics or
task-specific metrics, limiting their robustness and generalizability across
domains. In this work, we introduce a dynamic dataset pruning framework that
adaptively selects training samples based on both task-driven difficulty and
cross-modality semantic consistency. By incorporating supervision from
pretrained multimodal foundation models, our approach captures training
dynamics while effectively filtering out uninformative samples. Our work
highlights the potential of integrating cross-modality alignment for robust
sample selection, advancing data-centric learning toward more efficient and
robust practices across application domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new optimization framework, LySep, to address problems in deep learning-based methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for solving PDEs face challenges like converging to suboptimal local minima and issues with gradient exploding or vanishing due to the highly non-convex nature of the loss function.

Method: The LySep framework introduces auxiliary variables to split a deep neural network into multiple shallow architectures. The variables are updated via alternating direction methods, and new auxiliary variable-based loss functions are created, focusing on neighboring layers only.

Result: Theoretical analysis confirms consistency between LySep and deep models. High-dimensional numerical experiments show LySep improves loss minimization and reduces solution error.

Conclusion: LySep offers an effective solution to optimize deep learning-based methods for PDEs by mitigating common optimization issues.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new optimization framework, the layer separation
(LySep) model, to improve the deep learning-based methods in solving partial
differential equations. Due to the highly non-convex nature of the loss
function in deep learning, existing optimization algorithms often converge to
suboptimal local minima or suffer from gradient explosion or vanishing,
resulting in poor performance. To address these issues, we introduce auxiliary
variables to separate the layers of deep neural networks. Specifically, the
output and its derivatives of each layer are represented by auxiliary
variables, effectively decomposing the deep architecture into a series of
shallow architectures. New loss functions with auxiliary variables are
established, in which only variables from two neighboring layers are coupled.
Corresponding algorithms based on alternating directions are developed, where
many variables can be updated optimally in closed forms. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analyses demonstrating the consistency between the LySep model and
the original deep model. High-dimensional numerical results validate our theory
and demonstrate the advantages of LySep in minimizing loss and reducing
solution error.

Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to address the elevated financial distress risks faced by SMEs listed on the NEEQ, an important financing platform in China.

Method: The method involves designing a Triple-Channel Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) to process numeric, textual, and graph-based data separately, followed by an attention-based fusion mechanism and a gating unit.

Result: Experiments on data from 7,731 NEEQ companies demonstrate the proposed model's superiority over traditional machine learning methods and single-modality models, achieving better AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

Conclusion: The study presents a robust and accurate financial risk prediction tool that integrates multi-modality data, offering valuable insights for financial regulators and investors dealing with SMEs.

Abstract: With the continuous evolution of China's multi-level capital market, the
National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ), also known as the "New Third
Board," has become a critical financing platform for small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs). However, due to their limited scale and financial
resilience, many NEEQ-listed companies face elevated risks of financial
distress. To address this issue, we propose a multi-channel deep learning
framework that integrates structured financial indicators, textual disclosures,
and enterprise relationship data for comprehensive financial risk prediction.
Specifically, we design a Triple-Channel Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) that
processes numeric, textual, and graph-based inputs separately. These
modality-specific representations are fused using an attention-based mechanism
followed by a gating unit to enhance robustness and prediction accuracy.
Experimental results on data from 7,731 real-world NEEQ companies demonstrate
that our model significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series prediction remains challenging due to complexities like non-stationarity, multi-scale periodicity, and transient dynamics, worsened in long-term forecasts.

Method: FLDmamba leverages Fourier and Laplace transforms to effectively model multi-scale periodicity, transient dynamics, and enhance robustness against noise.

Result: FLDmamba outperformed Transformer-based and other Mamba-based architectures on time series benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework offers an efficient and robust solution for long-term time series prediction, with reproducibility supported via publicly accessible code and data.

Abstract: Time series prediction, a crucial task across various domains, faces
significant challenges due to the inherent complexities of time series data,
including non-stationarity, multi-scale periodicity, and transient dynamics,
particularly when tackling long-term predictions. While Transformer-based
architectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence
length hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements
in State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for
long-term modeling, but they cannot capture multi-scale periodicity and
transient dynamics effectively. Meanwhile, they are susceptible to data noise
issues in time series. This paper proposes a novel framework, FLDmamba (Fourier
and Laplace Transform Decomposition Mamba), addressing these limitations.
FLDmamba leverages the strengths of both Fourier and Laplace transforms to
effectively capture both multi-scale periodicity, transient dynamics within
time series data, and improve the robustness of the model to the data noise
issue. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FLDmamba achieves superior
performance on time series prediction benchmarks, outperforming both
Transformer-based and other Mamba-based architectures. To promote the
reproducibility of our method, we have made both the code and data accessible

### [178] [PMKLC: Parallel Multi-Knowledge Learning-based Lossless Compression for Large-Scale Genomics Database](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12805)
*Hui Sun,Yanfeng Ding,Liping Yi,Huidong Ma,Gang Wang,Xiaoguang Liu,Cheng Zhong,Wentong Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes PMKLC, a novel learning-based lossless compressor tackling limitations in compression ratio, speed, and robustness by leveraging multi-knowledge learning, GPU acceleration, and parallel processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based lossless compressors are hindered by inadequate compression performance, low throughput, and poor robustness, making them unsuitable for large-scale genomic data operations.

Method: The authors designed PMKLC with four key features: (1) multi-knowledge learning framework, (2) GPU-accelerated ($s$,$k$)-mer encoder, (3) data block partitioning and SMP mechanisms for parallelism, and (4) two modes (PMKLC-S and PMKLC-M) for single-GPU and multi-GPU applications.

Result: PMKLC-S/M outperformed 14 baseline methods (traditional and learning-based) on 15 datasets, achieving up to 73.6% improved compression ratios and throughput improvements of up to 10.71x.

Conclusion: The proposed PMKLC framework not only significantly enhances compression efficiency and robustness but also ensures stability on diverse datasets and strong performance under memory constraints.

Abstract: Learning-based lossless compressors play a crucial role in large-scale
genomic database backup, storage, transmission, and management. However, their
1) inadequate compression ratio, 2) low compression \& decompression
throughput, and 3) poor compression robustness limit their widespread adoption
and application in both industry and academia. To solve those challenges, we
propose a novel \underline{P}arallel \underline{M}ulti-\underline{K}nowledge
\underline{L}earning-based \underline{C}ompressor (PMKLC) with four crucial
designs: 1) We propose an automated multi-knowledge learning-based compression
framework as compressors' backbone to enhance compression ratio and robustness;
2) we design a GPU-accelerated ($s$,$k$)-mer encoder to optimize compression
throughput and computing resource usage; 3) we introduce data block
partitioning and Step-wise Model Passing (SMP) mechanisms for parallel
acceleration; 4) We design two compression modes PMKLC-S and PMKLC-M to meet
the complex application scenarios, where the former runs on a
resource-constrained single GPU and the latter is multi-GPU accelerated. We
benchmark PMKLC-S/M and 14 baselines (7 traditional and 7 leaning-based) on 15
real-world datasets with different species and data sizes. Compared to
baselines on the testing datasets, PMKLC-S/M achieve the average compression
ratio improvement up to 73.609\% and 73.480\%, the average throughput
improvement up to 3.036$\times$ and 10.710$\times$, respectively. Besides,
PMKLC-S/M also achieve the best robustness and competitive memory cost,
indicating its greater stability against datasets with different probability
distribution perturbations, and its strong ability to run on memory-constrained
devices.

### [179] [RONOM: Reduced-Order Neural Operator Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12814)
*Sven Dummer,Dongwei Ye,Christoph Brune*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RONOM, a framework combining Reduced-Order Modeling (ROM) and neural operators to address computational limitations in solving time-dependent PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational challenges in many-query scenarios for physics-based modeling demand efficient methods to address varying mesh resolutions and provide rigorous error estimates.

Method: The authors propose RONOM, which merges concepts of ROM's numerical error estimates and operator learning's adaptability to varying resolutions. Discretization error bounds are established alongside numerical comparisons.

Result: RONOM performs comparably in input generalization, superior in spatial super-resolution and discretization robustness, and offers insights for temporal super-resolution.

Conclusion: RONOM bridges ROM and neural operators, improving computational efficiency, error analysis, and robustness in solving PDEs across varying mesh resolutions.

Abstract: Time-dependent partial differential equations are ubiquitous in physics-based
modeling, but they remain computationally intensive in many-query scenarios,
such as real-time forecasting, optimal control, and uncertainty quantification.
Reduced-order modeling (ROM) addresses these challenges by constructing a
low-dimensional surrogate model but relies on a fixed discretization, which
limits flexibility across varying meshes during evaluation. Operator learning
approaches, such as neural operators, offer an alternative by parameterizing
mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling adaptation to
data across different resolutions. Whereas ROM provides rigorous numerical
error estimates, neural operator learning largely focuses on discretization
convergence and invariance without quantifying the error between the
infinite-dimensional and the discretized operators. This work introduces the
reduced-order neural operator modeling (RONOM) framework, which bridges
concepts from ROM and operator learning. We establish a discretization error
bound analogous to those in ROM, and get insights into RONOM's discretization
convergence and discretization robustness. Moreover, two numerical examples are
presented that compare RONOM to existing neural operators for solving partial
differential equations. The results demonstrate that RONOM using standard
vector-to-vector neural networks achieves comparable performance in input
generalization and superior performance in both spatial super-resolution and
discretization robustness, while also offering novel insights into temporal
super-resolution scenarios.

### [180] [From Novelty to Imitation: Self-Distilled Rewards for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12815)
*Gaurav Chaudhary,Laxmidhar Behera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReLOAD introduces a framework for offline RL that eliminates the need for explicit reward annotations using Random Network Distillation to generate intrinsic rewards from expert demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of high engineering costs or unavailability of explicit reward annotations in offline RL.

Method: ReLOAD leverages Random Network Distillation to compute a prediction error that acts as an intrinsic reward signal for expert transitions, eliminating handcrafted rewards.

Result: Experiments on the D4RL benchmark show ReLOAD achieves competitive performance with traditional reward-annotated offline RL methods.

Conclusion: ReLOAD provides a practical solution for offline RL by simplifying reward generation, enabling robust policy learning without requiring explicit reward annotations.

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to learn effective policies from a
static dataset without requiring further agent-environment interactions.
However, its practical adoption is often hindered by the need for explicit
reward annotations, which can be costly to engineer or difficult to obtain
retrospectively. To address this, we propose ReLOAD (Reinforcement Learning
with Offline Reward Annotation via Distillation), a novel reward annotation
framework for offline RL. Unlike existing methods that depend on complex
alignment procedures, our approach adapts Random Network Distillation (RND) to
generate intrinsic rewards from expert demonstrations using a simple yet
effective embedding discrepancy measure. First, we train a predictor network to
mimic a fixed target network's embeddings based on expert state transitions.
Later, the prediction error between these networks serves as a reward signal
for each transition in the static dataset. This mechanism provides a structured
reward signal without requiring handcrafted reward annotations. We provide a
formal theoretical construct that offers insights into how RND prediction
errors effectively serve as intrinsic rewards by distinguishing expert-like
transitions. Experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that ReLOAD enables
robust offline policy learning and achieves performance competitive with
traditional reward-annotated methods.

*Kaiqi Jiang,Jeremy Cohen,Yuanzhi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies the behavior of NTK eigenvectors during the Edge of Stability and their alignment with training targets, providing theoretical insights using a two-layer linear network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding the behavior of NTK eigenvectors during the Edge of Stability in deep learning.

Method: The authors investigate NTK eigenvector dynamics across different architectures, analyze alignment with training targets, and provide theoretical analysis focused on a two-layer linear network.

Result: Larger learning rates lead to greater alignment of NTK eigenvectors with training targets, observed in experiments across various architectures.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into how learning rate impacts NTK eigenvector dynamics, enhancing the understanding of Gradient Descent training behavior.

Abstract: The study of Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs) in deep learning has drawn
increasing attention in recent years. NTKs typically actively change during
training and are related to feature learning. In parallel, recent work on
Gradient Descent (GD) has found a phenomenon called Edge of Stability (EoS), in
which the largest eigenvalue of the NTK oscillates around a value inversely
proportional to the step size. However, although follow-up works have explored
the underlying mechanism of such eigenvalue behavior in depth, the
understanding of the behavior of the NTK eigenvectors during EoS is still
missing. This paper examines the dynamics of NTK eigenvectors during EoS in
detail. Across different architectures, we observe that larger learning rates
cause the leading eigenvectors of the final NTK, as well as the full NTK
matrix, to have greater alignment with the training target. We then study the
underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and provide a theoretical analysis for
a two-layer linear network. Our study enhances the understanding of GD training
dynamics in deep learning.

*Danilo Avola,Andrea Bernardini,Francesco Danese,Mario Lezoche,Maurizio Mancini,Daniele Pannone,Amedeo Ranaldi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a transformer-based method for identifying stationary individuals using Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) and achieves high classification accuracy in controlled environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a non-intrusive and privacy-preserving human identification system using Wi-Fi signals, particularly in scenarios without user motion.

Method: The team employed a transformer-based dual-branch architecture that separately processes amplitude and phase CSI data. A preprocessing pipeline was established to improve signal quality.

Result: Their approach achieved a classification accuracy of 99.82% using a dataset of six participants collected in controlled indoor environments.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate CSI's ability to encode biometric traits and validate passive, device-free person identification using cost-effective Wi-Fi hardware.

Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing is gaining momentum as a non-intrusive and privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based systems for human identification. However, person
identification through wireless signals, particularly without user motion,
remains largely unexplored. Most prior wireless-based approaches rely on
movement patterns, such as walking gait, to extract biometric cues. In
contrast, we propose a transformer-based method that identifies individuals
from Channel State Information (CSI) recorded while the subject remains
stationary. CSI captures fine-grained amplitude and phase distortions induced
by the unique interaction between the human body and the radio signal. To
support evaluation, we introduce a dataset acquired with ESP32 devices in a
controlled indoor environment, featuring six participants observed across
multiple orientations. A tailored preprocessing pipeline, including outlier
removal, smoothing, and phase calibration, enhances signal quality. Our
dual-branch transformer architecture processes amplitude and phase modalities
separately and achieves 99.82\% classification accuracy, outperforming
convolutional and multilayer perceptron baselines. These results demonstrate
the discriminative potential of CSI perturbations, highlighting their capacity
to encode biometric traits in a consistent manner. They further confirm the
viability of passive, device-free person identification using low-cost
commodity Wi-Fi hardware in real-world settings.

### [183] [Supervised Fine Tuning on Curated Data is Reinforcement Learning (and can be improved)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12856)
*Chongli Qin,Jost Tobias Springenberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a variant of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) termed importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT), which is designed to optimize a tighter bound to the reinforcement learning (RL) objective. It improves performance on both large language models and control policy tasks, approaching the effectiveness of more advanced RL algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The predominant paradigm of Behavior Cloning (BC) for supervised fine-tuning of large language models shows strong performance, but the authors seek to better understand and improve this via connections to reinforcement learning (RL) theory.

Method: The authors reformulate supervised fine-tuning as a lower-bound optimization problem of the RL objective in sparse reward settings and propose an importance-weighted variant, iw-SFT, which optimizes a tighter approximation to the RL target. This is generalizable to quality-scored data.

Result: The iw-SFT approach demonstrates higher performance than standard SFT in various benchmarks, such as scoring 66.7% on the AIME 2024 dataset, and shows competitiveness with advanced RL techniques for both large language models and continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed iw-SFT approach bridges the gap between traditional supervised fine-tuning and RL-based optimization through a simple modification, offering significant performance gains and competitive results in language modeling and control tasks.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) on curated (or filtered) data is the predominant
paradigm for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models; as well as
for imitation learning of control policies. Here, we draw on a connection
between this successful strategy and the theory and practice of finding optimal
policies via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Building on existing literature, we
clarify that SFT can be understood as maximizing a lower bound on the RL
objective in a sparse reward setting. Giving support to its often observed good
performance. From this viewpoint, we realize that a small modification to SFT
leads to an importance weighted variant that behaves closer to training with RL
as it: i) optimizes a tighter bound to the RL objective and, ii) can improve
performance compared to SFT on curated data. We refer to this variant as
importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT). We show that it is easy to
implement and can be further generalized to training with quality scored data.
The resulting SFT variants are competitive with more advanced RL algorithms for
large language models and for training policies in continuous control tasks.
For example achieving 66.7% on the AIME 2024 dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores using ear-EEG signals for biometric authentication and demonstrates an average accuracy of 82% for identifying subjects, indicating its practicality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the usability issues in traditional EEG-based biometric systems by using ear-EEG signals, which are more practical and user-friendly.

Method: Temporal and spectral features are extracted from ear-EEG signals and processed using a fully connected deep neural network for identifying subjects.

Result: Experimental results show an 82% average accuracy in identifying subjects using ear-EEG signals.

Conclusion: Ear-EEG signals have potential as a deployable and practical solution for real-world biometric authentication systems.

Abstract: This work explores the feasibility of biometric authentication using EEG
signals acquired through in-ear devices, commonly referred to as ear-EEG.
Traditional EEG-based biometric systems, while secure, often suffer from low
usability due to cumbersome scalp-based electrode setups. In this study, we
propose a novel and practical framework leveraging ear-EEG signals as a
user-friendly alternative for everyday biometric authentication. The system
extracts an original combination of temporal and spectral features from ear-EEG
signals and feeds them into a fully connected deep neural network for subject
identification. Experimental results on the only currently available ear-EEG
dataset suitable for different purposes, including biometric authentication,
demonstrate promising performance, with an average accuracy of 82\% in a
subject identification scenario. These findings confirm the potential of
ear-EEG as a viable and deployable direction for next-generation real-world
biometric systems.

*Yao Feng,Hengkai Tan,Xinyi Mao,Guodong Liu,Shuhe Huang,Chendong Xiang,Hang Su,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces VIDAR, a framework for bimanual robotic manipulation using video diffusion pre-training and masked inverse dynamics models, achieving strong generalization with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bimanual robotic tasks are challenging due to data scarcity and differences in robots’ embodiment. There’s a need for scalable solutions to enable better generalization in diverse manipulation settings.

Method: The authors propose VIDAR, a framework with two main stages: large-scale video diffusion model pre-trained on multi-view videos from bimanual robots, and a masked inverse dynamics model for action prediction without needing pixel-level labels.

Result: VIDAR achieved impressive generalization to unseen tasks and backgrounds using only 20 minutes of demonstration data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in diverse real-world robotic settings.

Conclusion: VIDAR demonstrates the potential of combining video diffusion models with masked action prediction to enhance generalizability and scalability in bimanual robotic manipulation while reducing data requirements.

Abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation, which involves the coordinated control of two
robotic arms, is foundational for solving challenging tasks. Despite recent
progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment
heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual
settings. In this paper, we introduce VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning
(VIDAR), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based
video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action
prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos
from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation
space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse
dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from
generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can
effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that
with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only
1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and
backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models,
coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable
robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.

*Luca Stradiotti,Dario Pesenti,Stefano Teso,Jesse Davis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ULER, a machine learning framework that enables classifiers to reject inputs with low-quality explanations based on human-centric quality assessments, outperforming current methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of low-quality explanations in critical machine learning applications, especially when end-users cannot trust or interpret predictions adequately.

Method: The authors propose ULER, a framework equipped with a rejector trained using human ratings and per-feature relevance judgments to assess and reject low-quality explanations from machine learning predictors.

Result: Experiments show that ULER outperforms existing state-of-the-art rejector strategies on eight classification and regression benchmarks, as well as on a new human-annotated dataset.

Conclusion: Classifiers that can reject low-quality explanations, such as ULER, improve trust and interpretability in machine learning predictions, enhancing downstream decision-making in high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Machine Learning predictors are increasingly being employed in high-stakes
applications such as credit scoring. Explanations help users unpack the reasons
behind their predictions, but are not always "high quality''. That is,
end-users may have difficulty interpreting or believing them, which can
complicate trust assessment and downstream decision-making. We argue that
classifiers should have the option to refuse handling inputs whose predictions
cannot be explained properly and introduce a framework for learning to reject
low-quality explanations (LtX) in which predictors are equipped with a rejector
that evaluates the quality of explanations. In this problem setting, the key
challenges are how to properly define and assess explanation quality and how to
design a suitable rejector. Focusing on popular attribution techniques, we
introduce ULER (User-centric Low-quality Explanation Rejector), which learns a
simple rejector from human ratings and per-feature relevance judgments to
mirror human judgments of explanation quality. Our experiments show that ULER
outperforms both state-of-the-art and explanation-aware learning to reject
strategies at LtX on eight classification and regression benchmarks and on a
new human-annotated dataset, which we will publicly release to support future
research.

### [187] [Fremer: Lightweight and Effective Frequency Transformer for Workload Forecasting in Cloud Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12908)
*Jiadong Chen,Hengyu Ye,Fuxin Jiang,Xiao He,Tieying Zhang,Jianjun Chen,Xiaofeng Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new deep forecasting model called Fremer is introduced, tailored for efficient and accurate workload forecasting in cloud environments, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies of Transformer-based forecasting models in handling large-scale cloud workload data, focusing on the complex periodic patterns in the frequency domain.

Method: The authors propose Fremer, a deep forecasting model optimized for efficiency and accuracy, particularly for periodic workload series. They use newly collected workload datasets derived from ByteDance's cloud services for validation.

Result: Fremer achieves average improvements of 5.5% in MSE, 4.7% in MAE, and 8.6% in SMAPE over state-of-the-art models. Additionally, it enhances operational metrics such as reducing latency by 18.78% and resource consumption by 2.35% in a Kubernetes auto-scaling scenario.

Conclusion: Fremer proves to be a practical and superior solution for workload forecasting in cloud environments, excelling in efficiency, accuracy, and real-world application performance.

Abstract: Workload forecasting is pivotal in cloud service applications, such as
auto-scaling and scheduling, with profound implications for operational
efficiency. Although Transformer-based forecasting models have demonstrated
remarkable success in general tasks, their computational efficiency often falls
short of the stringent requirements in large-scale cloud environments. Given
that most workload series exhibit complicated periodic patterns, addressing
these challenges in the frequency domain offers substantial advantages. To this
end, we propose Fremer, an efficient and effective deep forecasting model.
Fremer fulfills three critical requirements: it demonstrates superior
efficiency, outperforming most Transformer-based forecasting models; it
achieves exceptional accuracy, surpassing all state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in
workload forecasting; and it exhibits robust performance for multi-period
series. Furthermore, we collect and open-source four high-quality, open-source
workload datasets derived from ByteDance's cloud services, encompassing
workload data from thousands of computing instances. Extensive experiments on
both our proprietary datasets and public benchmarks demonstrate that Fremer
consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving average improvements of
5.5% in MSE, 4.7% in MAE, and 8.6% in SMAPE over SOTA models, while
simultaneously reducing parameter scale and computational costs. Additionally,
in a proactive auto-scaling test based on Kubernetes, Fremer improves average
latency by 18.78% and reduces resource consumption by 2.35%, underscoring its
practical efficacy in real-world applications.

*Chenrui Zhu,Louenas Bounia,Vu Linh Nguyen,Sébastien Destercke,Arthur Hoarau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an uncertainty-aware framework to improve model explainability by distinguishing aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, impacting robustness in explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasingly complex machine learning models need transparent and robust explanations for their predictions as interpretability diminishes.

Method: They classify uncertainty into aleatoric and epistemic categories to tailor and reject explanations, combining it with classical explainability methods.

Result: Experiments validate the framework’s effectiveness in enhancing robustness and attainability of explanations in machine learning and deep learning models.

Conclusion: Uncertainty quantification can complement explainability methods and serve as a guiding principle for improving prediction robustness in complex models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have emphasized the need for
transparency in model predictions, particularly as interpretability diminishes
when using increasingly complex architectures. In this paper, we propose
leveraging prediction uncertainty as a complementary approach to classical
explainability methods. Specifically, we distinguish between aleatoric
(data-related) and epistemic (model-related) uncertainty to guide the selection
of appropriate explanations. Epistemic uncertainty serves as a rejection
criterion for unreliable explanations and, in itself, provides insight into
insufficient training (a new form of explanation). Aleatoric uncertainty
informs the choice between feature-importance explanations and counterfactual
explanations. This leverages a framework of explainability methods driven by
uncertainty quantification and disentanglement. Our experiments demonstrate the
impact of this uncertainty-aware approach on the robustness and attainability
of explanations in both traditional machine learning and deep learning
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the problem of sequence recovery from noisy copies, which is critical for applications like DNA data storage that suffer from errors during synthesis, storage, and sequencing.

Method: The authors propose TReconLM, a method that employs language models trained on next-token prediction, initially pretrained on synthetic data and then fine-tuned on real-world data to adapt to technology-specific error patterns.

Result: TReconLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art trace reconstruction algorithms, including existing deep learning methods, by recovering a higher fraction of sequences accurately.

Conclusion: The proposed TReconLM is an effective solution for trace reconstruction, demonstrating its capability to improve sequence recovery performance in scenarios like DNA data storage.

Abstract: The general trace reconstruction problem seeks to recover an original
sequence from its noisy copies independently corrupted by deletions,
insertions, and substitutions. This problem arises in applications such as DNA
data storage, a promising storage medium due to its high information density
and longevity. However, errors introduced during DNA synthesis, storage, and
sequencing require correction through algorithms and codes, with trace
reconstruction often used as part of the data retrieval process. In this work,
we propose TReconLM, which leverages language models trained on next-token
prediction for trace reconstruction. We pretrain language models on synthetic
data and fine-tune on real-world data to adapt to technology-specific error
patterns. TReconLM outperforms state-of-the-art trace reconstruction
algorithms, including prior deep learning approaches, recovering a
substantially higher fraction of sequences without error.

*Hongze Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two modifications to enhance the DAPO algorithm for stable and efficient policy optimization, utilizing pre-trained guiding policies and leveraging discarded samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard policy gradient methods suffer from instability and inefficiency in sparse reward scenarios, necessitating improvements to address these challenges in DAPO.

Method: The paper proposes integrating a pre-trained guiding policy for off-policy experience and re-utilizing zero-reward samples via expert policy assistance to boost efficiency and stability.

Result: Theoretical analysis confirms that the proposed methods converge to optimal solutions within reinforcement learning frameworks.

Conclusion: The mixed-policy framework improves exploration-exploitation balance, training stability, and policy optimization efficiency while addressing common pitfalls in sparse reward environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces two novel modifications to the Differentiable Automatic
Post-editing Optimization (DAPO) algorithm, approached from a mixed-policy
perspective. Standard policy gradient methods can suffer from instability and
sample inefficiency, particularly in sparse reward settings. To address this,
we first propose a method that incorporates a pre-trained, stable guiding
policy ($\piphi$) to provide off-policy experience, thereby regularizing the
training of the target policy ($\pion$). This approach improves training
stability and convergence speed by adaptively adjusting the learning step size.
Secondly, we extend this idea to re-utilize zero-reward samples, which are
often discarded by dynamic sampling strategies like DAPO's. By treating these
samples as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy, we further enhance
sample efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis for both methods,
demonstrating that their objective functions converge to the optimal solution
within the established theoretical framework of reinforcement learning. The
proposed mixed-policy framework effectively balances exploration and
exploitation, promising more stable and efficient policy optimization.

*Weiqiu You,Anton Xue,Shreya Havaldar,Delip Rao,Helen Jin,Chris Callison-Burch,Eric Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARES, a probabilistic framework designed to detect errors in reasoning chains by large language models (LLMs), emphasizing prevention of error propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Initial errors in reasoning chains of LLMs propagate, undermining the final conclusion's reliability. Current methods fail to address the impact of such propagation on downstream reasoning.

Method: Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES) evaluates claims based on sound premises, scores each reasoning step, and provides statistical guarantees of soundness.

Result: ARES achieved state-of-the-art results across four benchmarks with 72.1% Macro-F1 (+8.2 points) and excelled in long reasoning chains, achieving 90.3% F1 (+27.6 points).

Conclusion: ARES effectively prevents error propagation in LLM reasoning chains and demonstrates superior performance and robustness, making it a significant advancement in error detection.

Abstract: In reasoning chains generated by large language models (LLMs), initial errors
often propagate and undermine the reliability of the final conclusion. Current
LLM-based error detection methods often fail to detect propagated errors
because they do not properly account for how earlier errors might corrupt
judgments of downstream reasoning. To better detect such propagated errors, we
introduce Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES), a novel
probabilistic framework that prevents error propagation by judging each claim
based only on previously-assessed sound premises. This inductive method yields
a nuanced score for each step and provides certified statistical guarantees of
its soundness, rather than a brittle binary label. ARES achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (72.1% Macro-F1, +8.2
points) and demonstrates superior robustness on very long synthetic reasoning
chains, where it excels at detecting propagated errors (90.3% F1, +27.6
points).

TL;DR: The paper explores the interpretability of MAIRA-2, a radiology-focused large language model, using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to uncover clinically relevant features. Challenges and outcomes are highlighted.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improved interpretability in AI models is crucial for healthcare applications due to the significant consequences of medical decisions. This study aims to make models like MAIRA-2 more interpretable and transparent.

Method: The researchers applied Matryoshka-SAE, sparse autoencoders, to identify internal representations and clinically relevant features in MAIRA-2. Automated methods and steering experiments studied the impact of these features on model behavior.

Result: Features such as medical devices, pathologies, longitudinal changes, and textual elements were successfully identified. Steering experiments demonstrated partial directional control over model generations.

Conclusion: Insights into MAIRA-2's internal representations were achieved despite methodological challenges, paving the way towards better understanding and transparency in radiology-adapted multimodal language models.

Abstract: Interpretability can improve the safety, transparency and trust of AI models,
which is especially important in healthcare applications where decisions often
carry significant consequences. Mechanistic interpretability, particularly
through the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), offers a promising approach for
uncovering human-interpretable features within large transformer-based models.
In this study, we apply Matryoshka-SAE to the radiology-specialised multimodal
large language model, MAIRA-2, to interpret its internal representations. Using
large-scale automated interpretability of the SAE features, we identify a range
of clinically relevant concepts - including medical devices (e.g., line and
tube placements, pacemaker presence), pathologies such as pleural effusion and
cardiomegaly, longitudinal changes and textual features. We further examine the
influence of these features on model behaviour through steering, demonstrating
directional control over generations with mixed success. Our results reveal
practical and methodological challenges, yet they offer initial insights into
the internal concepts learned by MAIRA-2 - marking a step toward deeper
mechanistic understanding and interpretability of a radiology-adapted
multimodal large language model, and paving the way for improved model
transparency. We release the trained SAEs and interpretations:

### [193] [A Spectral Interpretation of Redundancy in a Graph Reservoir](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12963)
*Anna Bison,Alessandro Sperduti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new spectral reservoir method for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) using a Fairing algorithm to address over-smoothing issues in graph signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of over-smoothing in GNNs caused by repeated layer operations, which leads to a convergence toward low-frequency components, potentially reducing model performance.

Method: The method revises the spectral reservoir in MRGNN by incorporating a Fairing algorithm (from surface design) as a pass-band spectral filter. This allows smoothing of graph signals without shrinkage and is adapted through the Laplacian operator.

Result: Theoretical analysis from a random walks perspective shows that tuning spectral coefficients modulates redundant random walk contributions. Exploratory experiments demonstrate the approach's potential for graph classification and related tasks.

Conclusion: The use of the Fairing algorithm in spectral reservoirs improves understanding and performance in GNN tasks by controlling smoothing, opening up promising pathways for future research.

Abstract: Reservoir computing has been successfully applied to graphs as a
preprocessing method to improve the training efficiency of Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). However, a common issue that arises when repeatedly applying
layer operators on graphs is over-smoothing, which consists in the convergence
of graph signals toward low-frequency components of the graph Laplacian. This
work revisits the definition of the reservoir in the Multiresolution Reservoir
Graph Neural Network (MRGNN), a spectral reservoir model, and proposes a
variant based on a Fairing algorithm originally introduced in the field of
surface design in computer graphics. This algorithm provides a pass-band
spectral filter that allows smoothing without shrinkage, and it can be adapted
to the graph setting through the Laplacian operator. Given its spectral
formulation, this method naturally connects to GNN architectures for tasks
where smoothing, when properly controlled, can be beneficial,such as graph
classification. The core contribution of the paper lies in the theoretical
analysis of the algorithm from a random walks perspective. In particular, it
shows how tuning the spectral coefficients can be interpreted as modulating the
contribution of redundant random walks. Exploratory experiments based on the
MRGNN architecture illustrate the potential of this approach and suggest
promising directions for future research.

### [194] [WaveletInception Networks for Drive-by Vibration-Based Infrastructure Health Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12969)
*Reza Riahi Samani,Alfredo Nunez,Bart De Schutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel WaveletInception-BiLSTM deep learning framework is introduced for infrastructure health monitoring using drive-by vibration signals, offering automated, high-resolution assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address the challenges of accurate and localized infrastructure health monitoring using drive-by vibration signals.

Method: The paper employs a WaveletInception feature extractor with Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) for spectral feature extraction, integrates operational conditions via LSTM, and uses BiLSTM for bi-directional sequential modeling.

Result: The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in railway track stiffness estimation, specifically in ballast and railpad stiffness parameters.

Conclusion: WaveletInception-BiLSTM demonstrates significant potential for high-resolution, automated assessments of infrastructure health using drive-by vibration signals.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based framework for infrastructure
health monitoring using drive-by vibration response signals. Recognizing the
importance of spectral and temporal information, we introduce the
WaveletInception-BiLSTM network. The WaveletInception feature extractor
utilizes a Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) as the stem for extracting
vibration signal features, incorporating spectral information in the early
network layers. This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract
multi-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration
signal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM) layer. The resulting feature extraction network
effectively analyzes drive-by vibration signals across various measurement
speeds without preprocessing and uses LSTM to capture interrelated temporal
dependencies among different modes of information and to create feature vectors
for health condition estimation. The estimator head is designed with a
sequential modeling architecture using bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks,
capturing bi-directional temporal relationships from drive-by measurements.
This architecture allows for a high-resolution, beam-level assessment of
infrastructure health conditions. A case study focusing on railway track
stiffness estimation with simulated drive-by vibration signals shows that the
model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating railway
ballast and railpad stiffness parameters. Results underscore the potential of
this approach for accurate, localized, and fully automated drive-by
infrastructure health monitoring.

*Youssef Tawfilis,Hossam Amer,Minar El-Aasser,Tallal Elshabrawy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a decentralized approach for training GAN models that utilizes distributed data without sharing raw data, addressing challenges of data and device heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the difficulty of collecting large datasets for GAN training due to privacy concerns and device limitations, alongside underutilized device resources.

Method: The paper combines KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning for data heterogeneity and Heterogeneous U-shaped split learning to handle device heterogeneity while ensuring strict data privacy.

Result: The experimental results indicate significant performance improvements including 1.1x–2.2x higher image generation scores and a 10%-50% boost in classification metrics with reduced latency.

Conclusion: The proposed decentralized GAN training approach effectively enables collaborative model training while upholding privacy and overcoming resource constraints.

Abstract: Federated Learning has gained increasing attention for its ability to enable
multiple nodes to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing
their raw data. At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However,
training generative models typically requires large datasets and significant
computational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings.
Acquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many
underutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying
capabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due
to privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling
to share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
for decentralized GAN training that enables the utilization of distributed data
and underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw
form. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized
environments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address
the issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous
U-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under
strict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether
real or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes. Experimental results shows
that our approach demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across
key performance metrics, where it achieves 1.1x -- 2.2x higher image generation
scores, an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 50% in
multi-domain non-IID settings), in much lower latency compared to several
benchmarks. Find our code at https://github.com/youssefga28/HuSCF-GAN.

*Nikita Koriagin,Yaroslav Aksenov,Daniil Laptev,Gleb Gerasimov,Nikita Balagansky,Daniil Gavrilov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) for domain-specific feature extraction using a secondary SAE for modeling reconstruction error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse Autoencoders struggle with capturing domain-specific features not commonly found in their training data.

Method: Train a secondary Sparse Autoencoder to model reconstruction error of a pretrained SAE on domain-specific texts, then sum their outputs during inference.

Result: Improved LLM cross-entropy and explained variance metrics in specialized domains, while preserving general performance.

Conclusion: This approach efficiently enhances domain-specific interpretability of SAEs, enabling targeted analysis of Large Language Models.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting the
internal representations of Large Language Models, yet they often fail to
capture domain-specific features not prevalent in their training corpora. This
paper introduces a residual learning approach that addresses this feature
blindness without requiring complete retraining. We propose training a
secondary SAE specifically to model the reconstruction error of a pretrained
SAE on domain-specific texts, effectively capturing features missed by the
primary model. By summing the outputs of both models during inference, we
demonstrate significant improvements in both LLM cross-entropy and explained
variance metrics across multiple specialized domains. Our experiments show that
this method efficiently incorporates new domain knowledge into existing SAEs
while maintaining their performance on general tasks. This approach enables
researchers to selectively enhance SAE interpretability for specific domains of
interest, opening new possibilities for targeted mechanistic interpretability
of LLMs.

### [197] [SMART: Relation-Aware Learning of Geometric Representations for Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13001)
*Kossi Amouzouvi,Bowen Song,Andrea Coletta,Luigi Bellomarini,Jens Lehmann,Sahar Vahdati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a new framework to improve Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE) by assigning or voting for the best-fitting geometric transformations for relations, proving its effectiveness on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KGE models use fixed or composite geometric transformations for all relations in a KG, which may not optimally preserve relational and structural patterns. The motivation is to create a model that adapts transformations to relation-specific needs.

Method: The approach evaluates which geometric transformation best fits each relation via ranking. Based on the results, the model either assigns the optimal transformation to each relation or determines a majority-based transformation for all relations. An attention mechanism is used to learn transformation-specific embeddings in low-dimensional space, which is then utilized for high-dimensional embeddings.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark Knowledge Graphs and a real-world financial dataset show performance comparable to leading models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances relation-specific adaptation in KGE, proving effective in capturing relational information and achieving competitive performance.

Abstract: Knowledge graph representation learning approaches provide a mapping between
symbolic knowledge in the form of triples in a knowledge graph (KG) and their
feature vectors. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent
relations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA)
KGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such
as translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These
geometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific
structural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs
by KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific
transformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by
ensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite
version of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent
all the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how
well each relation fits with different geometric transformations. Based on this
ranking, the model can: (1) assign the best-matching transformation to each
relation, or (2) use majority voting to choose one transformation type to apply
across all relations. That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT
in low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we
use the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low
dimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space. The
effectiveness of our models is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations
on three benchmark KGs as well as a real-world financial KG, witnessing a
performance comparable to leading models

*Luis Basora,Louison Bocquet-Nouaille,Elinirina Robinson,Serge Le Gonidec*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a fault detection and diagnostic system tailored for reusable space launch engines' electrical systems, emphasizing confidence level estimation, out-of-distribution detection, and false alarm control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance health monitoring capabilities for next-generation reusable space launchers by addressing limitations in existing fault detection and diagnosis systems, particularly in handling confidence levels, out-of-distribution scenarios, and minimizing false alarms.

Method: The method involves using a temporal convolutional autoencoder for feature extraction from sensor data, paired with binary and multiclass histogram-based gradient boosting classifiers for fault detection and diagnosis. These classifiers are calibrated for confidence level estimation. Complementary techniques like inductive conformal anomaly detection and CUSUM are employed for out-of-distribution data detection and false alarm control.

Result: The system was evaluated on simulated data under nominal and anomalous conditions. The results suggest the framework's potential for effective fault detection and diagnosis, although more testing with real-world data is needed.

Conclusion: The proposed system demonstrates promise as an initial step towards a reliable onboard fault detection and diagnostic capability for space launch vehicles, but further validation using real data is essential for operational readiness.

Abstract: In the context of the health monitoring for the next generation of reusable
space launchers, we outline a first step toward developing an onboard fault
detection and diagnostic capability for the electrical system that controls the
engine valves. Unlike existing approaches in the literature, our solution is
designed to meet a broader range of key requirements. This includes estimating
confidence levels for predictions, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) cases,
and controlling false alarms. The proposed solution is based on a temporal
convolutional autoencoder to automatically extract low-dimensional features
from raw sensor data. Fault detection and diagnosis are respectively carried
out using a binary and a multiclass classifier trained on the autoencoder
latent and residual spaces. The classifiers are histogram-based gradient
boosting models calibrated to output probabilities that can be interpreted as
confidence levels. A relatively simple technique, based on inductive conformal
anomaly detection, is used to identify OOD data. We leverage other simple yet
effective techniques, such as cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) to limit the
false alarms, and threshold moving to address class imbalance in fault
detection. The proposed framework is highly configurable and has been evaluated
on simulated data, covering both nominal and anomalous operational scenarios.
The results indicate that our solution is a promising first step, though
testing with real data will be necessary to ensure that it achieves the
required maturity level for operational use.

*Ahmed Emam,Ribana Roscher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a data-centric framework combining LRP Attention Rollout and Deep Deterministic Uncertainty (DDU) to enhance the interpretability and uncertainty-awareness in assessing natural areas using satellite imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to enhance monitoring of protected natural areas for ecological balance using satellite imagery and machine learning, addressing the lack of interpretability and uncertainty consideration in current methods.

Method: The authors introduce the Confidence-Filtered Relevance (CFR) framework, incorporating LRP Attention Rollout and DDU estimation to analyze the impact of model uncertainty on interpretability. The approach partitions the dataset into subsets based on uncertainty thresholds to assess relevance in naturalness heatmaps.

Result: CFR demonstrated efficacy in assigning higher relevance to areas like shrublands, forests, and wetlands using the AnthroProtect dataset, aligning with prior research. It showed that increased uncertainty reduces interpretability and increases heatmap entropy.

Conclusion: CFR provides a systematic, data-centric method for linking model certainty to relevance in naturalness assessments, enhancing interpretability and highlighting uncertainty in satellite imagery analysis.

Abstract: Protected natural areas play a vital role in ecological balance and ecosystem
services. Monitoring these regions at scale using satellite imagery and machine
learning is promising, but current methods often lack interpretability and
uncertainty-awareness, and do not address how uncertainty affects naturalness
assessment. In contrast, we propose Confidence-Filtered Relevance (CFR), a
data-centric framework that combines LRP Attention Rollout with Deep
Deterministic Uncertainty (DDU) estimation to analyze how model uncertainty
influences the interpretability of relevance heatmaps. CFR partitions the
dataset into subsets based on uncertainty thresholds, enabling systematic
analysis of how uncertainty shapes the explanations of naturalness in satellite
imagery. Applied to the AnthroProtect dataset, CFR assigned higher relevance to
shrublands, forests, and wetlands, aligning with other research on naturalness
assessment. Moreover, our analysis shows that as uncertainty increases, the
interpretability of these relevance heatmaps declines and their entropy grows,
indicating less selective and more ambiguous attributions. CFR provides a
data-centric approach to assess the relevance of patterns to naturalness in
satellite imagery based on their associated certainty.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the best Transformer architecture for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) and proposes a taxonomy to enable clear comparisons, providing insights on effective design choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate what Transformer architecture is most effective for LTSF tasks, and overcome challenges of disentangling various tightly coupled time-series-specific designs.

Method: Development of a taxonomy to enable unified comparisons of Transformer architectures based on attention mechanisms, forecasting aggregations, paradigms, and normalization layers, followed by extensive experiments.

Result: Bi-directional attention with joint-attention, complete forecasting aggregation, and direct-mapping paradigms are identified as most effective. The combined optimal model outperforms several existing designs.

Conclusion: The study offers insights and validated choices for Transformer architectural designs in LTSF, aiming to guide future research in this domain.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have recently become dominant in Long-term Time
Series Forecasting (LTSF), yet the variations in their architecture, such as
encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only designs, raise a crucial
question: What Transformer architecture works best for LTSF tasks? However,
existing models are often tightly coupled with various time-series-specific
designs, making it difficult to isolate the impact of the architecture itself.
To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy that disentangles these designs,
enabling clearer and more unified comparisons of Transformer architectures. Our
taxonomy considers key aspects such as attention mechanisms, forecasting
aggregations, forecasting paradigms, and normalization layers. Through
extensive experiments, we uncover several key insights: bi-directional
attention with joint-attention is most effective; more complete forecasting
aggregation improves performance; and the direct-mapping paradigm outperforms
autoregressive approaches. Furthermore, our combined model, utilizing optimal
architectural choices, consistently outperforms several existing models,
reinforcing the validity of our conclusions. We hope these findings offer
valuable guidance for future research on Transformer architectural designs in
LTSF. Our code is available at https://github.com/HALF111/TSF_architecture.

TL;DR: This paper investigates PAC and online learnability in hypothesis classes of labeled infinite graphs under vertex permutations. It links learnability to automorphic triviality and classifies infinite graphs based on their labeling complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the learnability properties of labeled infinite graphs under vertex permutations and explore the relationship between PAC and online learning in these scenarios.

Method: The authors studied hypothesis classes induced by vertex permutations, analyzed finite-support copies of graphs, and applied tools from descriptive set theory and computability theory to classify infinite graphs.

Result: The study found that PAC learnability of finite-support copies implies online learnability of the full graph's isomorphism type. It also identified properties like automorphic triviality and a four-class partition of infinite graphs according to labeling complexity.

Conclusion: The paper bridges PAC and online learnability for infinite graphs through structural properties, providing a classification of labeling complexity based on graph isomorphism and automorphisms.

Abstract: We study PAC and online learnability of hypothesis classes formed by copies
of a countably infinite graph G, where each copy is induced by permuting G's
vertices. This corresponds to learning a graph's labeling, knowing its
structure and label set. We consider classes where permutations move only
finitely many vertices. Our main result shows that PAC learnability of all such
finite-support copies implies online learnability of the full isomorphism type
of G, and is equivalent to the condition of automorphic triviality. We also
characterize graphs where copies induced by swapping two vertices are not
learnable, using a relaxation of the extension property of the infinite random
graph. Finally, we show that, for all G and k>2, learnability for k-vertex
permutations is equivalent to that for 2-vertex permutations, yielding a
four-class partition of infinite graphs, whose complexity we also determine
using tools coming from both descriptive set theory and computability theory.

Motivation: While NAS is essential for deep learning and DARTS has enhanced efficiency, limitations remain in applying NAS to Vision Transformers due to reliance on computationally expensive and traditional methods.

Method: The paper proposes DASViT, a differentiable search approach targeting Vision Transformer architectures to overcome the limitations of traditional macro-level NAS.

Result: DASViT produces architectures that surpass ViT-B/16 in performance on multiple datasets, with increased efficiency and reduced computational demands.

Conclusion: DASViT provides a breakthrough in the design of ViTs, offering innovative and resource-efficient architectures that challenge traditional Transformer encoder designs.

Abstract: Designing effective neural networks is a cornerstone of deep learning, and
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful tool for automating
this process. Among the existing NAS approaches, Differentiable Architecture
Search (DARTS) has gained prominence for its efficiency and ease of use,
inspiring numerous advancements. Since the rise of Vision Transformers (ViT),
researchers have applied NAS to explore ViT architectures, often focusing on
macro-level search spaces and relying on discrete methods like evolutionary
algorithms. While these methods ensure reliability, they face challenges in
discovering innovative architectural designs, demand extensive computational
resources, and are time-intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce
Differentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer (DASViT), which
bridges the gap in differentiable search for ViTs and uncovers novel designs.
Experiments show that DASViT delivers architectures that break traditional

Motivation: To develop a robust XAI technique that is deterministic, model-agnostic, and provides guarantees of convergence.

Method: The authors propose a measure-theoretic approach called MUPAX, which employs structured perturbation analysis to attribute feature importance and eliminates spurious relationships, applicable across 1D, 2D, and 3D domains.

Result: MUPAX enhances model accuracy by focusing on essential data patterns, outperforming existing XAI methods in precision, consistency, and understandability in tasks including audio, image, and medical data analysis.

Conclusion: MUPAX represents a significant advancement for trustworthy AI by providing effective and principled explainability applicable to virtually any AI problem context.

Abstract: Robust XAI techniques should ideally be simultaneously deterministic, model
agnostic, and guaranteed to converge. We propose MULTIDIMENSIONAL PROBLEM
AGNOSTIC EXPLAINABLE AI (MUPAX), a deterministic, model agnostic explainability
technique, with guaranteed convergency. MUPAX measure theoretic formulation
gives principled feature importance attribution through structured perturbation
analysis that discovers inherent input patterns and eliminates spurious
relationships. We evaluate MUPAX on an extensive range of data modalities and
tasks: audio classification (1D), image classification (2D), volumetric medical
image analysis (3D), and anatomical landmark detection, demonstrating dimension
agnostic effectiveness. The rigorous convergence guarantees extend to any loss
function and arbitrary dimensions, making MUPAX applicable to virtually any
problem context for AI. By contrast with other XAI methods that typically
decrease performance when masking, MUPAX not only preserves but actually
enhances model accuracy by capturing only the most important patterns of the
original data. Extensive benchmarking against the state of the XAI art
demonstrates MUPAX ability to generate precise, consistent and understandable
explanations, a crucial step towards explainable and trustworthy AI systems.

*Hyo-Jeong Jang,Hye-Bin Shin,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of label noise and knowledge transfer in EEG learning by introducing a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework, which improves EEG-based model performance by aligning feature semantics and resolving label inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance EEG learning in BCIs, which is hindered by intrinsic signal errors and label noise, through the use of multimodal knowledge distillation.

Method: The proposed method introduces a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that uses a prototype-based similarity module for feature alignment and a task-specific distillation head for addressing label inconsistencies.

Result: The framework significantly improved EEG-based emotion regression and classification performance, surpassing both unimodal and multimodal baselines on a public multimodal dataset.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework for improving EEG learning in brain-computer interface applications.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a fundamental modality for cognitive state
monitoring in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, it is highly
susceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which
lead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance. To enhance EEG
learning, multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored to transfer
knowledge from visual models with rich representations to EEG-based models.
Nevertheless, KD faces two key challenges: modality gap and soft label
misalignment. The former arises from the heterogeneous nature of EEG and visual
feature spaces, while the latter stems from label inconsistencies that create
discrepancies between ground truth labels and distillation targets. This paper
addresses semantic uncertainty caused by ambiguous features and weakly defined
labels. We propose a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that
mitigates both modality and label inconsistencies. It aligns feature semantics
through a prototype-based similarity module and introduces a task-specific
distillation head to resolve label-induced inconsistency in supervision.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves EEG-based emotion
regression and classification performance, outperforming both unimodal and
multimodal baselines on a public multimodal dataset. These findings highlight
the potential of our framework for BCI applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Neural Graph Topic Model (NGTM), a generative framework for graph generation that emphasizes interpretability, allowing fine-grained control over graph properties using topic modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph generation methods lack interpretability, making it hard to understand the reasons behind structural choices in generated graphs.

Method: The authors propose NGTM, which models graphs as mixtures of latent topics, each corresponding to semantically meaningful substructures. This approach integrates topic distributions with a global structural variable for transparent and interpretable graph generation.

Result: The NGTM demonstrates competitive graph generation quality and provides unique interpretability and control, enabling adjustments to graph structures or properties through topic-level modifications.

Conclusion: NGTM bridges the gap between realistic graph generation and interpretability, offering a method that not only generates high-quality graphs but also provides users with insights and control over the generation process.

Abstract: Graph generation plays a pivotal role across numerous domains, including
molecular design and knowledge graph construction. Although existing methods
achieve considerable success in generating realistic graphs, their
interpretability remains limited, often obscuring the rationale behind
structural decisions. To address this challenge, we propose the Neural Graph
Topic Model (NGTM), a novel generative framework inspired by topic modeling in
natural language processing. NGTM represents graphs as mixtures of latent
topics, each defining a distribution over semantically meaningful
substructures, which facilitates explicit interpretability at both local and
global scales. The generation process transparently integrates these topic
distributions with a global structural variable, enabling clear semantic
tracing of each generated graph. Experiments demonstrate that NGTM achieves
competitive generation quality while uniquely enabling fine-grained control and
interpretability, allowing users to tune structural features or induce
biological properties through topic-level adjustments.

Motivation: The study aims to tackle the lack of diverse open-source datasets with nonverbal vocalizations (NVs), a bottleneck for expressive speech synthesis.

Method: They developed an automated pipeline comprising ASR, NV tagging, emotion classification, and a fusion algorithm for transcription merging, followed by fine-tuning open-source TTS models using the NVTTS dataset.

Result: The fine-tuned models achieved parity with closed-source systems like CosyVoice2, validated by human evaluations and automated metrics, including speaker similarity and NV fidelity.

Abstract: Current expressive speech synthesis models are constrained by the limited
availability of open-source datasets containing diverse nonverbal vocalizations
(NVs). In this work, we introduce NonverbalTTS (NVTTS), a 17-hour open-access
dataset annotated with 10 types of NVs (e.g., laughter, coughs) and 8 emotional
categories. The dataset is derived from popular sources, VoxCeleb and Expresso,
using automated detection followed by human validation. We propose a
comprehensive pipeline that integrates automatic speech recognition (ASR), NV
tagging, emotion classification, and a fusion algorithm to merge transcriptions
from multiple annotators. Fine-tuning open-source text-to-speech (TTS) models
on the NVTTS dataset achieves parity with closed-source systems such as
CosyVoice2, as measured by both human evaluation and automatic metrics,
including speaker similarity and NV fidelity. By releasing NVTTS and its
accompanying annotation guidelines, we address a key bottleneck in expressive
TTS research. The dataset is available at

*Ofir Nabati,Bo Dai,Shie Mannor,Guy Tennenholtz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called Spectral Bellman Representation to improve reinforcement learning (RL) by aligning learned representations with the fundamental structure of Bellman updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing representation learning methods in RL are often misaligned with the actual tasks of RL, leading to suboptimal results. There is a need for a framework that directly addresses value-based RL tasks.

Method: The proposed method derives from the Inherent Bellman Error condition and leverages a spectral relationship between the transformation of value functions by the Bellman operator and the feature covariance structure. This leads to a new objective for learning state-action features aligned with Bellman dynamics.

Result: The paper demonstrates that the proposed representation learning approach enables structured exploration, aligns feature covariance with Bellman dynamics, and achieves improved performance in hard-exploration and long-horizon credit assignment tasks.

Conclusion: Spectral Bellman Representation provides a theoretically-grounded and effective approach to learning representations, enhancing structured exploration and performance in value-based RL frameworks.

Abstract: The effect of representation has been demonstrated in reinforcement learning,
from both theoretical and empirical successes. However, the existing
representation learning mainly induced from model learning aspects, misaligning
with our RL tasks. This work introduces Spectral Bellman Representation, a
novel framework derived from the Inherent Bellman Error (IBE) condition, which
aligns with the fundamental structure of Bellman updates across a space of
possible value functions, therefore, directly towards value-based RL. Our key
insight is the discovery of a fundamental spectral relationship: under the
zero-IBE condition, the transformation of a distribution of value functions by
the Bellman operator is intrinsically linked to the feature covariance
structure. This spectral connection yields a new, theoretically-grounded
objective for learning state-action features that inherently capture this
Bellman-aligned covariance. Our method requires a simple modification to
existing algorithms. We demonstrate that our learned representations enable
structured exploration, by aligning feature covariance with Bellman dynamics,
and improve overall performance, particularly in challenging hard-exploration
and long-horizon credit assignment tasks. Our framework naturally extends to
powerful multi-step Bellman operators, further broadening its impact. Spectral
Bellman Representation offers a principled and effective path toward learning
more powerful and structurally sound representations for value-based
reinforcement learning.

*Shreyas Chaudhari,Srinivasa Pranav,José M. F. Moura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on leveraging Monotone Gradient Networks (mGradNets) to learn optimal transport mappings by minimizing a loss function based on the Monge-Ampère equation, with applications like robot swarm control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimal transport, particularly via monotone gradient functions, is crucial in areas like fluid dynamics and robot swarm control. Existing solutions require effective parameterization of these monotone gradients for efficient computation.

Method: The paper builds on mGradNets, neural networks parameterizing monotone gradient maps, to formulate a learning approach using a loss based on the Monge-Ampère equation for finding optimal transport mappings.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that mGradNets structurally facilitate the learning of optimal transport maps. The method is applied successfully to a robot swarm control scenario.

Conclusion: mGradNets prove to be effective in learning and applying optimal transport maps, showcasing their potential in practical applications such as robot control.

Abstract: Monotone gradient functions play a central role in solving the Monge
formulation of the optimal transport problem, which arises in modern
applications ranging from fluid dynamics to robot swarm control. When the
transport cost is the squared Euclidean distance, Brenier's theorem guarantees
that the unique optimal map is the gradient of a convex function, namely a
monotone gradient map, and it satisfies a Monge-Amp\`ere equation. In
[arXiv:2301.10862] [arXiv:2404.07361], we proposed Monotone Gradient Networks
(mGradNets), neural networks that directly parameterize the space of monotone
gradient maps. In this work, we leverage mGradNets to directly learn the
optimal transport mapping by minimizing a training loss function defined using
the Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We empirically show that the structural bias of
mGradNets facilitates the learning of optimal transport maps and employ our
method for a robot swarm control problem.

*Etienne Le Naour,Tahar Nabil,Ghislain Agoua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoTM, leveraging implicit neural representations for handling out-of-domain time series imputation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series models focus heavily on forecasting, ignoring out-of-domain imputation for missing data, a critical gap.

Method: The approach uses Mixture of Timeflow Models (MoTM), which integrates independently trained INRs with a ridge regressor for adapting to context during inference.

Result: MoTM demonstrates strong performance on diverse imputation challenges, showcasing robust generalization both in-domain and out-of-domain.

Conclusion: The framework represents a step toward adaptable foundation imputation models for handling varied missing data scenarios.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest for time series foundation
models, with a strong emphasis on the forecasting task. Yet, the crucial task
of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We
propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural
representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and
naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they
have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle
under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of
Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation.
Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen
patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a
distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the
observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and
out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block
and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for
adaptable foundation imputation models.

### [211] [Leveraging Asynchronous Cross-border Market Data for Improved Day-Ahead Electricity Price Forecasting in European Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13250)
*Maria Margarida Mascarenhas,Jilles De Blauwe,Mikael Amelin,Hussain Kazmi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study demonstrates that asynchronously published prices, due to varying gate closure times (GCTs) across bidding zones, can improve short-term electricity price forecasting accuracy when incorporated as model input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore whether price data from interconnected markets with earlier GCTs can enhance the accuracy of electricity price forecasts in other markets with later GCTs, addressing the challenge of quality and timing of input covariates in forecasting.

Method: The authors use a state-of-the-art ensemble of models and include price data from interconnected markets to forecast electricity prices. They evaluate the impact through forecast accuracy improvement and explore model recalibration and interpretability.

Result: The addition of interconnected market price data led to significant forecast accuracy improvements in Belgian (22%) and Swedish (9%) bidding zones. The findings also showed the importance of frequent recalibration and highlighted limitations when using data from multiple markets.

Conclusion: Incorporating prices from markets with earlier GCTs can substantially improve forecasting performance for certain zones, but this benefit is nuanced by the need for frequent model recalibration and selective data inclusion to ensure accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate short-term electricity price forecasting is crucial for
strategically scheduling demand and generation bids in day-ahead markets. While
data-driven techniques have shown considerable prowess in achieving high
forecast accuracy in recent years, they rely heavily on the quality of input
covariates. In this paper, we investigate whether asynchronously published
prices as a result of differing gate closure times (GCTs) in some bidding zones
can improve forecasting accuracy in other markets with later GCTs. Using a
state-of-the-art ensemble of models, we show significant improvements of 22%
and 9% in forecast accuracy in the Belgian (BE) and Swedish bidding zones (SE3)
respectively, when including price data from interconnected markets with
earlier GCT (Germany-Luxembourg, Austria, and Switzerland). This improvement
holds for both general as well as extreme market conditions. Our analysis also
yields further important insights: frequent model recalibration is necessary
for maximum accuracy but comes at substantial additional computational costs,
and using data from more markets does not always lead to better performance - a
fact we delve deeper into with interpretability analysis of the forecast
models. Overall, these findings provide valuable guidance for market
participants and decision-makers aiming to optimize bidding strategies within
increasingly interconnected and volatile European energy markets.

### [212] [Merge Kernel for Bayesian Optimization on Permutation Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13263)
*Zikai Xie,Linjiang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new kernel framework for Bayesian Optimization in permutation spaces, reducing computation complexity from quadratic to linearithmic by leveraging merge sort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the inefficiency of the Mallows kernel, which has a high computational cost for permutation space optimization.

Method: They create the Merge Kernel using merge sort instead of bubble sort, achieving reduced computational complexity. Additionally, lightweight descriptors like shift histogram, split-pair line, and sliding-window motifs enhance robustness.

Result: Empirical evaluation demonstrates the Merge Kernel's superiority in performance over the Mallows kernel across various optimization benchmarks.

Conclusion: The Merge Kernel offers a compact and efficient solution for Bayesian Optimization in permutation space, excelling in both computational and optimization performance.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm is a standard tool for black-box
optimization problems. The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation
spaces relies on the Mallows kernel-an $\Omega(n^2)$ representation that
explicitly enumerates every pairwise comparison. Inspired by the close
relationship between the Mallows kernel and pairwise comparison, we propose a
novel framework for generating kernel functions on permutation space based on
sorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as
a special instance derived from bubble sort. Further, we introduce the
\textbf{Merge Kernel} constructed from merge sort, which replaces the quadratic
complexity with $\Theta(n\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity.
The resulting feature vector is significantly shorter, can be computed in
linearithmic time, yet still efficiently captures meaningful permutation
distances. To boost robustness and right-invariance without sacrificing
compactness, we further incorporate three lightweight, task-agnostic
descriptors: (1) a shift histogram, which aggregates absolute element
displacements and supplies a global misplacement signal; (2) a split-pair line,
which encodes selected long-range comparisons by aligning elements across the
two halves of the whole permutation; and (3) sliding-window motifs, which
summarize local order patterns that influence near-neighbor objectives. Our
empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed kernel consistently
outperforms the state-of-the-art Mallows kernel across various permutation
optimization benchmarks. Results confirm that the Merge Kernel provides a more
compact yet more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in permutation
space.

### [213] [Boosting Team Modeling through Tempo-Relational Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13305)
*Vincenzo Marco De Luca,Giovanna Varni,Andrea Passerini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRENN and MT-TRENN architectures for modeling team dynamics, emphasizing temporal and relational aspects while providing interpretable, actionable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to address the gap in existing models that fail to simultaneously predict multiple team constructs and provide actionable recommendations in collaborative environments.

Method: TRENN integrates a temporal graph extractor, tempo-relational encoder, decoder, and explainability modules, while MT-TRENN adds a multi-task head to predict shared Social Embeddings and team constructs.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows that TRENN and MT-TRENN outperform other models focused solely on temporal or relational information, with explainability modules offering valuable insights.

Conclusion: The proposed models are promising for Human-Centered AI applications, enabling effective decision-support systems in high-stakes environments through robust predictions and actionable insights.

Abstract: Team modeling remains a fundamental challenge at the intersection of
Artificial Intelligence and the Social Sciences. Social Science research
emphasizes the need to jointly model dynamics and relations, while practical
applications demand unified models capable of inferring multiple team
constructs simultaneously, providing interpretable insights and actionable
recommendations to enhance team performance. However, existing works do not
meet these practical demands. To bridge this gap, we present TRENN, a novel
tempo-relational architecture that integrates: (i) an automatic temporal graph
extractor, (ii) a tempo-relational encoder, (iii) a decoder for team construct
prediction, and (iv) two complementary explainability modules. TRENN jointly
captures relational and temporal team dynamics, providing a solid foundation
for MT-TRENN, which extends TReNN by replacing the decoder with a multi-task
head, enabling the model to learn shared Social Embeddings and simultaneously
predict multiple team constructs, including Emergent Leadership, Leadership
Style, and Teamwork components. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms approaches that rely exclusively on temporal
or relational information. Additionally, experimental evaluation has shown that
the explainability modules integrated in MT-TRENN yield interpretable insights
and actionable suggestions to support team improvement. These capabilities make
our approach particularly well-suited for Human-Centered AI applications, such
as intelligent decision-support systems in high-stakes collaborative
environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoReg, a regression model leveraging satellite imagery, geospatial data, and large language model insights to estimate socio-economic indicators for data-scarce regions, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing need for accurate socio-economic indicators in data-scarce regions to assist policy-making and promote sustainable development.

Method: GeoReg integrates satellite imagery, web-based geospatial data, and large language model-derived features to perform regression analysis in few-shot scenarios. The model categorizes feature correlations, assigns tailored weights, and incorporates nonlinear feature transformations.

Result: The proposed model demonstrated enhanced performance in estimating socio-economic indicators across three countries at varying development stages, particularly excelling in low-income, data-constrained regions.

Conclusion: GeoReg provides a robust tool for estimating vital socio-economic indicators, paving the way for better policy decisions and development strategies, especially in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Socio-economic indicators like regional GDP, population, and education
levels, are crucial to shaping policy decisions and fostering sustainable
development. This research introduces GeoReg a regression model that integrates
diverse data sources, including satellite imagery and web-based geospatial
information, to estimate these indicators even for data-scarce regions such as
developing countries. Our approach leverages the prior knowledge of large
language model (LLM) to address the scarcity of labeled data, with the LLM
functioning as a data engineer by extracting informative features to enable
effective estimation in few-shot settings. Specifically, our model obtains
contextual relationships between data features and the target indicator,
categorizing their correlations as positive, negative, mixed, or irrelevant.
These features are then fed into the linear estimator with tailored weight
constraints for each category. To capture nonlinear patterns, the model also
identifies meaningful feature interactions and integrates them, along with
nonlinear transformations. Experiments across three countries at different
stages of development demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines in
estimating socio-economic indicators, even for low-income countries with
limited data availability.

### [215] [Training Transformers with Enforced Lipschitz Constants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13338)
*Laker Newhouse,R. Preston Hess,Franz Cesista,Andrii Zahorodnii,Jeremy Bernstein,Phillip Isola*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops tools to enforce Lipschitz constraints in neural network training, enabling stable transformer models, but achieving competitive performance requires scaling constraints significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks exhibit sensitivity to input and weight perturbations, causing instability, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, and overfitting. Researchers aim to mitigate these issues with Lipschitz components, though training modern architectures with sustained Lipschitz bounds has remained challenging.

Method: The authors introduced computational tools for norm-constrained weight matrices and leveraged optimizer dynamics (like switching to Muon) to enforce Lipschitz constraints throughout transformer model training, achieving varying trade-offs between Lipschitz bounds and performance.

Result: Their approach achieved notable accuracy results (e.g., 60% for a smaller transformer and 21% for larger scale models) but required massively increasing Lipschitz upper bounds to match baseline accuracy (such as NanoGPT's 39.4%).

Conclusion: While enforcing Lipschitz constraints improves training stability and eliminates reliance on certain measures (like layer norm), achieving competitive practical performance still demands relaxing those bounds significantly.

Abstract: Neural networks are often highly sensitive to input and weight perturbations.
This sensitivity has been linked to pathologies such as vulnerability to
adversarial examples, divergent training, and overfitting. To combat these
problems, past research has looked at building neural networks entirely from
Lipschitz components. However, these techniques have not matured to the point
where researchers have trained a modern architecture such as a transformer with
a Lipschitz certificate enforced beyond initialization. To explore this gap, we
begin by developing and benchmarking novel, computationally-efficient tools for
maintaining norm-constrained weight matrices. Applying these tools, we are able
to train transformer models with Lipschitz bounds enforced throughout training.
We find that optimizer dynamics matter: switching from AdamW to Muon improves
standard methods -- weight decay and spectral normalization -- allowing models
to reach equal performance with a lower Lipschitz bound. Inspired by Muon's
update having a fixed spectral norm, we co-design a weight constraint method
that improves the Lipschitz vs. performance tradeoff on MLPs and 2M parameter
transformers. Our 2-Lipschitz transformer on Shakespeare text reaches
validation accuracy 60%. Scaling to 145M parameters, our 10-Lipschitz
transformer reaches 21% accuracy on internet text. However, to match the
NanoGPT baseline validation accuracy of 39.4%, our Lipschitz upper bound
increases to 10^264. Nonetheless, our Lipschitz transformers train without
stability measures such as layer norm, QK norm, and logit tanh softcapping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance the success rate and robustness of adversarial attacks to address security challenges faced by image classifiers under adversarial conditions.

Method: Combine evolutionary algorithms with the latent space of GANs to generate vectors that represent adversarial attacks; evaluated on handwritten digit and object image classification.

Result: Achieved success rates of up to 35% for handwritten digits and 75% for object images, outperforming other methods in handling diverse and complex datasets.

Conclusion: The method is effective and robust in generating adversarial attacks across diverse and challenging datasets, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Image classification currently faces significant security challenges due to
adversarial attacks, which consist of intentional alterations designed to
deceive classification models based on artificial intelligence. This article
explores an approach to generate adversarial attacks against image classifiers
using a combination of evolutionary algorithms and generative adversarial
networks. The proposed approach explores the latent space of a generative
adversarial network with an evolutionary algorithm to find vectors representing
adversarial attacks. The approach was evaluated in two case studies
corresponding to the classification of handwritten digits and object images.
The results showed success rates of up to 35% for handwritten digits, and up to
75% for object images, improving over other search methods and reported results
in related works. The applied method proved to be effective in handling data
diversity on the target datasets, even in problem instances that presented
additional challenges due to the complexity and richness of information.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the impact of coevolutionary training strategies on GAN performance, finding that full generational replacement methods yield better results than elitist approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GANs are challenging to train due to mode collapse and instability. Co-evolutionary approaches are explored as a potential solution.

Method: The study compares different coevolutionary GAN training schemes across several datasets, focusing on selection and replacement mechanisms like (mu,lambda) and elitism.

Result: Full generational replacement ((mu,lambda)) consistently outperforms elitist schemes by providing better sample quality and diversity, especially with larger offspring sizes.

Conclusion: Balancing exploration and exploitation is crucial for effective coevolutionary GAN training, offering insights for designing advanced generative models.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are powerful generative models but
remain challenging to train due to pathologies suchas mode collapse and
instability. Recent research has explored co-evolutionary approaches, in which
populations of generators and discriminators are evolved, as a promising
solution. This paper presents an empirical analysis of different coevolutionary
GAN training strategies, focusing on the impact of selection and replacement
mechanisms. We compare (mu,lambda), (mu+lambda) with elitism, and (mu+lambda)
with tournament selection coevolutionary schemes, along with a non-evolutionary
population based multi-generator multi-discriminator GAN baseline, across both
synthetic low-dimensional datasets (blob and gaussian mixtures) and an
image-based benchmark (MNIST). Results show that full generational replacement,
i.e., (mu,lambda), consistently outperforms in terms of both sample quality and
diversity, particularly when combined with larger offspring sizes. In contrast,
elitist approaches tend to converge prematurely and suffer from reduced
diversity. These findings highlight the importance of balancing exploration and
exploitation dynamics in coevolutionary GAN training and provide guidance for
designing more effective population-based generative models.

*Tom Smeding,Mikołaj Konarski,Simon Peyton Jones,Andrew Fitzgibbon*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper enhances dual-numbers reverse-mode automatic differentiation (AD) for multidimensional array support and proposes a new algorithm to improve performance while trading off generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the practical performance of dual-numbers reverse-mode AD, particularly for multidimensional array programs, which is limited in current implementations.

Method: The method includes three components: a semantics-preserving vectorisation transformation (BOT), a specialized lifting of the dual-numbers AD algorithm to an array language, and symbolic interpretation for compilation.

Result: The proposed approach introduces first-class multidimensional array support with minimal performance overhead but loses some flexibility, particularly for higher-order code.

Conclusion: The authors achieve efficient reverse-mode AD for array programs by limiting generalizability (supporting a restricted set of array combinators), enabling effective performance improvements.

Abstract: The standard dual-numbers construction works well for forward-mode automatic
differentiation (AD) and is attractive due to its simplicity; recently, it also
has been adapted to reverse-mode AD, but practical performance, especially on
array programs, leaves a lot to be desired. In this paper we introduce
first-class support for multidimensional arrays in dual-numbers reverse-mode AD
with little to no performance overhead. The algorithm consists of three
loosely-coupled components: a semantics-preserving vectorisation code
transformation (the bulk-operation transform or BOT), a fairly straightforward
lifting of the basic dual-numbers reverse AD algorithm to a mostly first-order
array language, and symbolic interpretation to achieve an end-to-end
compilation pipeline. Unfortunately, we lose some of the nice generalisable
aspects of dual-numbers AD in the process, most importantly support for
higher-order code.
  We do support some higher-order array combinators, but only a
carefully-chosen set: 'build' (elementwise array construction), 'gather' and
'scatter'. In return, the BOT can eliminate the essential (for AD)
higher-orderness of the input program, meaning that AD gets essentially
presented with a first-order program. This allows the naive trick of lifting
dual numbers to "dual arrays" to work without much modification.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a mechanized and proven-faithful semantics for modern regular expressions with backtracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regular expressions with backtracking semantics lack a formalized semantics that aligns with ECMAScript's specification while being practical for real-world applications.

Method: The authors mechanized a semantics for regular expressions, ensuring its faithfulness through equivalence proofs to ECMAScript's specification and utilized the Rocq proof assistant.

Result: Developed two applications: a contextual equivalence proof system for regex and provided the first formal proof for the PikeVM algorithm.

Conclusion: The semantics capture not just the top match but all backtracking possibilities, ensuring practical and complete expressions processing.

Abstract: We present the first mechanized, succinct, practical, complete, and
proven-faithful semantics for a modern regular expression language with
backtracking semantics. We ensure its faithfulness by proving it equivalent to
a preexisting line-by-line embedding of the official ECMAScript specification
of JavaScript regular expressions. We demonstrate its practicality by
presenting two real-world applications. First, a new notion of contextual
equivalence for modern regular expressions, which we use to prove or disprove
rewrites drawn from previous work. Second, the first formal proof of the PikeVM
algorithm used in many real-world engines. In contrast with the specification
and other formalization work, our semantics captures not only the top-priority
match, but a full backtracking tree recording all possible matches and their
respective priority. All our definitions and results have been mechanized in
the Rocq proof assistant.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Astrogator, a system to verify the correctness of LLM-generated code in the Ansible programming language, achieving high verification rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users often struggle to detect errors in code generated by LLMs, highlighting the need for formal correctness guarantees to improve user experience and enable programming for non-experts.

Method: A formal query language is introduced to capture user intent, which is then used along with a calculus and symbolic interpreter to verify LLM-generated code.

Result: Astrogator verified correct code in 83% of tasks and identified incorrect code in 92% of tasks across 21 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating formal verification methods can significantly enhance the reliability of LLM-assisted coding by ensuring alignment with user intent.

Abstract: In the past few years LLMs have emerged as a tool that can aid programmers by
taking natural language descriptions and generating code based on it. However,
LLMs often generate incorrect code that users need to fix and the literature
suggests users often struggle to detect these errors. In this work we seek to
offer formal guarantees of correctness to LLM generated code; such guarantees
could improve the experience of using AI Code Assistants and potentially enable
natural language programming for users with little or no programming knowledge.
To address this challenge we propose to incorporate a formal query language
that can represent a user's intent in a formally defined but natural
language-like manner that a user can confirm matches their intent. Then, using
such a query we propose to verify LLM generated code to ensure it matches the
user's intent. We implement these ideas in our system, Astrogator, for the
Ansible programming language which includes such a formal query language, a
calculus for representing the behavior of Ansible programs, and a symbolic
interpreter which is used for the verification. On a benchmark suite of 21
code-generation tasks, our verifier is able to verify correct code in 83% of
cases and identify incorrect code in 92%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address insufficient handling of LiDAR-specific effects in existing Novel View Synthesis (NVS) methods for LiDAR simulation and large-scale 3D reconstruction.

Method: The method explicitly models LiDAR-specific sensor characteristics such as rolling shutter, laser power variations, and intensity falloff to improve the accuracy of simulation.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative comparisons, along with ablation studies, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art methods. It can also achieve advanced resimulation capabilities like high-resolution LiDAR scans from a camera perspective.

Conclusion: The method enhances the fidelity of LiDAR simulation, highlighting the importance of modeling sensor-specific characteristics. The code and dataset are publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Methods for Novel View Synthesis (NVS) have recently found traction in the
field of LiDAR simulation and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction. While
solutions for faster rendering or handling dynamic scenes have been proposed,
LiDAR specific effects remain insufficiently addressed. By explicitly modeling
sensor characteristics such as rolling shutter, laser power variations, and
intensity falloff, our method achieves more accurate LiDAR simulation compared
to existing techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods,
as well as ablation studies that highlight the importance of each sensor model
component. Beyond that, we show that our approach exhibits advanced
resimulation capabilities, such as generating high resolution LiDAR scans in

*Yucen Wang,Rui Yu,Shenghua Wan,Le Gan,De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces FOUNDER, a framework combining Foundation Models (FMs) and World Models (WMs) for improved task solving in embodied environments without rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between generalizable FMs and dynamic WMs for enhanced task generalization and open-ended task solving in complex, reward-free environments.

Method: FOUNDER integrates FM representations into the WM state space, allowing goal-conditioned policy learning with a mapping function that infers physical states. It uses temporal distance predictions as a reward signal during behavior learning.

Result: The framework outperforms prior methods in multi-task offline visual control benchmarks, especially in tasks with complex observations and domain gaps. It also exhibits consistency between predicted and ground-truth rewards.

Conclusion: FOUNDER effectively combines FM knowledge with WM dynamics for flexible reward-free task solving, showcasing superiority in semantic understanding and robust performance across tasks.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) and World Models (WMs) offer complementary strengths
in task generalization at different levels. In this work, we propose FOUNDER, a
framework that integrates the generalizable knowledge embedded in FMs with the
dynamic modeling capabilities of WMs to enable open-ended task solving in
embodied environments in a reward-free manner. We learn a mapping function that
grounds FM representations in the WM state space, effectively inferring the
agent's physical states in the world simulator from external observations. This
mapping enables the learning of a goal-conditioned policy through imagination
during behavior learning, with the mapped task serving as the goal state. Our
method leverages the predicted temporal distance to the goal state as an
informative reward signal. FOUNDER demonstrates superior performance on various
multi-task offline visual control benchmarks, excelling in capturing the
deep-level semantics of tasks specified by text or videos, particularly in
scenarios involving complex observations or domain gaps where prior methods
struggle. The consistency of our learned reward function with the ground-truth
reward is also empirically validated. Our project website is

*Yuhang Lu,Jiadong Tu,Yuexin Ma,Xinge Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReAL-AD, a new framework for end-to-end autonomous driving that structures decision-making using three tiers of human cognitive reasoning, enhancing interpretability and performance through Vision-Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end autonomous driving methods suffer from sparse and fixed trajectory supervision, limiting their ability to mimic human-like hierarchical reasoning in decision-making.

Method: The authors propose ReAL-AD, which incorporates a three-tier human cognitive model: Strategic Reasoning Injector for high-level strategy, Tactical Reasoning Integrator for tactical decisions, and Hierarchical Trajectory Decoder for precise control actions. Vision-Language Models enhance situational awareness and reasoning at all levels.

Result: The proposed framework shows over 30% improvement in planning accuracy and safety in evaluations.

Conclusion: ReAL-AD demonstrates improved interpretability and effectiveness in autonomous driving by aligning with human-like hierarchical reasoning, showcasing its potential for safer and more adaptive driving systems.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising approach to unify
perception, prediction, and planning within a single framework, reducing
information loss and improving adaptability. However, existing methods often
rely on fixed and sparse trajectory supervision, limiting their ability to
capture the hierarchical reasoning process that human drivers naturally employ.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReAL-AD, a Reasoning-Augmented Learning
framework that structures decision-making in autonomous driving based on the
three-tier human cognitive model: Driving Strategy, Driving Decision, and
Driving Operation, where Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are incorporated to
enhance situational awareness and structured reasoning across these levels.
Specifically, we introduce: (1) the Strategic Reasoning Injector, which
formulates high-level driving strategies by interpreting complex traffic
contexts from VLM-generated insights; (2) the Tactical Reasoning Integrator,
which refines strategic intent into interpretable tactical choices such as lane
changes, overtaking, and speed adjustments; and (3) the Hierarchical Trajectory
Decoder, which progressively translates tactical decisions into precise control
actions for smooth and human-like trajectory execution. Extensive evaluations
show that integrating our framework improves planning accuracy and safety by
over 30%, making end-to-end autonomous driving more interpretable and aligned
with human-like hierarchical reasoning. The project page can be found at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether modern AI models, with their reasoning and creativity, can assist in creating intelligent tools rather than just smarter controllers, placing the problem-solving focus on tool design for robotics.

Method: Developed VLMgineer which leverages vision-language models for code generation and combines it with evolutionary search to co-design both physical tools and action plans iteratively.

Result: VLMgineer outperforms designs produced by human specifications and human-crafted tools across a benchmark of manipulation tasks, offering innovative and more effective solutions.

Conclusion: The proposed VLMgineer framework demonstrates the capability of AI to transform complex problems in robotics into simpler executable tasks; benchmark datasets and code have been released to propel further research.

Abstract: Tool design and use reflect the ability to understand and manipulate the
physical world through creativity, planning, and foresight. As such, these
capabilities are often regarded as measurable indicators of intelligence across
biological species. While much of today's research on robotic intelligence
focuses on generating better controllers, inventing smarter tools offers a
complementary form of physical intelligence: shifting the onus of
problem-solving onto the tool's design. Given the vast and impressive
common-sense, reasoning, and creative capabilities of today's foundation
models, we investigate whether these models can provide useful priors to
automatically design and effectively wield such tools? We present VLMgineer, a
framework that harnesses the code generation abilities of vision language
models (VLMs) together with evolutionary search to iteratively co-design
physical tools and the action plans that operate them to perform a task. We
evaluate VLMgineer on a diverse new benchmark of everyday manipulation
scenarios that demand creative tool design and use. Across this suite,
VLMgineer consistently discovers tools and policies that solve tasks more
effectively and innovatively, transforming challenging robotics problems into
straightforward executions. It also outperforms VLM-generated designs from
human specifications and existing human-crafted tools for everyday tasks. To
facilitate future research on automated tool invention, we will release our
benchmark and code.

Method: This study developed an autonomous robot, MoistureMapper, equipped with Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors and adaptive sampling strategies using Gaussian Process modeling for spatial moisture mapping. The robot also uses a direct push drill mechanism to deploy sensors.

Result: The adaptive sampling strategies led to a 30% reduction in travel distance and a 5% reduction in variance of the moisture maps, outperforming baseline greedy approaches. The system was validated via simulations and field experiments.

Conclusion: MoistureMapper demonstrates promising results as a cost-effective solution for accurate and efficient soil moisture measurement using autonomous robotics and adaptive sampling strategies.

Abstract: Soil moisture is a quantity of interest in many application areas including
agriculture and climate modeling. Existing methods are not suitable for scale
applications due to large deployment costs in high-resolution sensing
applications such as for variable irrigation. In this work, we design, build
and field deploy an autonomous mobile robot, MoistureMapper, for soil moisture
sensing. The robot is equipped with Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors and
a direct push drill mechanism for deploying the sensor to measure volumetric
water content in the soil. Additionally, we implement and evaluate multiple
adaptive sampling strategies based on a Gaussian Process based modeling to
build a spatial mapping of moisture distribution in the soil. We present
results from large scale computational simulations and proof-of-concept
deployment on the field. The adaptive sampling approach outperforms a greedy
benchmark approach and results in up to 30\% reduction in travel distance and
5\% reduction in variance in the reconstructed moisture maps. Link to video

### [226] [Learning to Predict Mobile Robot Stability in Off-Road Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12731)
*Nathaniel Rose,Arif Ahmed,Emanuel Gutierrez-Cornejo,Parikshit Maini*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops a learning-based method, IMUnet, to estimate stability for wheeled mobile robots using proprioceptive data, bypassing traditional stability metrics which are hard to measure in real-world off-road conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of navigating wheeled mobile robots in off-road environments where existing stability metrics, like Static Stability Margin or Zero Moment Point, are impractical due to their reliance on hard-to-measure parameters.

Method: The authors propose IMUnet, a lightweight neural network that uses proprioceptive data to estimate robot stability without requiring terrain models or force sensing. They introduce a vision-based ArUco tracking method to generate a scalar stability score (C3 score), used as training data.

Result: The paper demonstrates, via a pilot study, that the proposed method generalizes well to unseen conditions and different terrain types, using IMU and robot velocity inputs to estimate platform stability.

Conclusion: The method has potential for applications in precision tasks and as a tool for perception-based planning, particularly in challenging environments like agriculture and space exploration.

Abstract: Navigating in off-road environments for wheeled mobile robots is challenging
due to dynamic and rugged terrain. Traditional physics-based stability metrics,
such as Static Stability Margin (SSM) or Zero Moment Point (ZMP) require
knowledge of contact forces, terrain geometry, and the robot's precise
center-of-mass that are difficult to measure accurately in real-world field
conditions. In this work, we propose a learning-based approach to estimate
robot platform stability directly from proprioceptive data using a lightweight
neural network, IMUnet. Our method enables data-driven inference of robot
stability without requiring an explicit terrain model or force sensing.
  We also develop a novel vision-based ArUco tracking method to compute a
scalar score to quantify robot platform stability called C3 score. The score
captures image-space perturbations over time as a proxy for physical
instability and is used as a training signal for the neural network based
model. As a pilot study, we evaluate our approach on data collected across
multiple terrain types and speeds and demonstrate generalization to previously
unseen conditions. These initial results highlight the potential of using IMU
and robot velocity as inputs to estimate platform stability. The proposed
method finds application in gating robot tasks such as precision actuation and
sensing, especially for mobile manipulation tasks in agricultural and space
applications. Our learning method also provides a supervision mechanism for
perception based traversability estimation and planning.

*Cheng Liu,Fan Zhu,Yaoyu Zhuang Zhinan Chen Jiefeng Tang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight framework, ASC-SW, combining depth cameras and visual neural networks to improve mobile robot navigation by detecting deformable linear objects (DLOs) missed by traditional LiDAR sensors, offering faster and more accurate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of LiDAR sensors in detecting ground-level obstacles like wires and to enhance the computational efficiency of vision models for resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: Introduces a visual navigation framework, ASC-SW, featuring a segmentation model (ASCnet) with depth cameras, MobileNetV2 backbone, and Atrous Strip Convolution Spatial Pyramid Pooling integrated with Sliding Window post-processing for improved DLO recognition.

Result: The system achieved an Miou score of 75.3% on a self-built dataset and an inference speed of 9.3 FPS on Jetson Orin Nano, outperforming existing DLO detection models.

Conclusion: The proposed ASC-SW framework effectively balances segmentation accuracy and speed, making it suitable for edge computing applications in mobile robot navigation.

Abstract: With the rapid development of lightweight visual neural network
architectures, traditional high-performance vision models have undergone
significant compression, greatly improving their computational efficiency and
energy consumption ratio. This makes them feasible for deployment on
resource-constrained edge computing devices. We propose a visual-assisted
navigation framework called Atrous Strip Convolution-Sliding Window (ASC-SW),
which leverages a depth camera and a lightweight visual neural network to
assist map-based mobile robot navigation. This framework compensates for the
inability of traditional light detection and range (LiDAR) sensors to detect
ground-level obstacles such as ground-level wires. We introduce a lightweight
and efficient segmentation model, Atrous Strip Convolution Network (ASCnet),
for detecting deformable linear objects (DLOs). MobileNetV2 is used as the
backbone network, and Atrous Strip Convolution Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASCSPP)
is designed to extract DLO features more effectively. Atrous Strip Convolution
is integrated into ASCSPP to accurately identify the linear structure of DLOs
with low computational cost. Additionally, a Sliding Window (SW)
post-processing module is proposed to denoise the output in complex
environments, improving recognition accuracy. Our method strikes a balance
between inference speed and segmentation performance. It achieves a mean
Intersection over Union (Miou) score of 75.3% on a self-built dataset and
reaches 9.3 FPS inference speed on the Jetson Orin Nano edge device. Overall,
our approach outperforms existing DLO detection models and has been
successfully validated on a physical robotic platform.

### [228] [Refining Motion for Peak Performance: Identifying Optimal Gait Parameters for Energy-Efficient Quadrupedal Bounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12751)
*Yasser G. Alqaham,Jing Cheng,Zhenyu Gan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper investigates how gait parameters impact the energy efficiency of quadrupedal robots, using simulations and experiments to show that optimizing these parameters can significantly reduce energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the energy efficiency and autonomy of quadrupedal robots by exploring the influence of gait parameters, an area less studied compared to mechanical designs or actuation improvements.

Method: The researchers modeled the Unitree A1 robot and developed a locomotion controller to adjust gait parameters (duty factor, phase shift, stride duration). They conducted simulations using bounding gaits across three different speeds and validated their findings with experimental results.

Result: The study showed that optimizing gait parameters leads to significant energy savings, confirming their hypothesis and highlighting the importance of these parameters in quadrupedal locomotion.

Conclusion: Optimizing gait parameters is an effective strategy for improving the energy efficiency of quadrupedal robots, providing insights that can be directly applied to commercially available platforms.

Abstract: Energy efficiency is a critical factor in the performance and autonomy of
quadrupedal robots. While previous research has focused on mechanical design
and actuation improvements, the impact of gait parameters on energetics has
been less explored. In this paper, we hypothesize that gait parameters,
specifically duty factor, phase shift, and stride duration, are key
determinants of energy consumption in quadrupedal locomotion. To test this
hypothesis, we modeled the Unitree A1 quadrupedal robot and developed a
locomotion controller capable of independently adjusting these gait parameters.
Simulations of bounding gaits were conducted in Gazebo across a range of gait
parameters at three different speeds: low, medium, and high. Experimental tests
were also performed to validate the simulation results. The findings
demonstrate that optimizing gait parameters can lead to significant reductions
in energy consumption, enhancing the overall efficiency of quadrupedal
locomotion. This work contributes to the advancement of energy-efficient
control strategies for legged robots, offering insights directly applicable to
commercially available platforms.

### [229] [osmAG-LLM: Zero-Shot Open-Vocabulary Object Navigation via Semantic Maps and Large Language Models Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12753)
*Fujing Xie,Sören Schwertfeger,Hermann Blum*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a system that efficiently navigates robots to objects, even when they may have moved or are not mapped, using a blend of semantic priors and lightweight maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional high-fidelity robot mapping approaches become obsolete quickly due to the dynamic nature of object locations, necessitating a new system that accounts for unmapped or relocated objects.

Method: The study introduces a system that integrates environment context maps with semantic knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to actively reason about and navigate toward queried objects.

Result: The proposed system achieves higher object retrieval success rates in static scenarios and significantly outperforms previous methods in dynamic and unmapped object situations, through both simulated and real-world evaluations.

Conclusion: By prioritizing lightweight mapping and leveraging LLM-based semantic reasoning, the system addresses scalability and robustness challenges, making it a step forward in object-goal robot navigation.

Abstract: Recent open-vocabulary robot mapping methods enrich dense geometric maps with
pre-trained visual-language features, achieving a high level of detail and
guiding robots to find objects specified by open-vocabulary language queries.
While the issue of scalability for such approaches has received some attention,
another fundamental problem is that high-detail object mapping quickly becomes
outdated, as objects get moved around a lot. In this work, we develop a mapping
and navigation system for object-goal navigation that, from the ground up,
considers the possibilities that a queried object can have moved, or may not be
mapped at all. Instead of striving for high-fidelity mapping detail, we
consider that the main purpose of a map is to provide environment grounding and
context, which we combine with the semantic priors of LLMs to reason about
object locations and deploy an active, online approach to navigate to the
objects. Through simulated and real-world experiments we find that our approach
tends to have higher retrieval success at shorter path lengths for static
objects and by far outperforms prior approaches in cases of dynamic or unmapped
object queries. We provide our code and dataset at:

*Jikai Wang,Yunqi Cheng,Zonghai Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a lightweight and robust visual-repeating navigation method for mobile robots that doesn't require precise localization or dense map reconstructions, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile robot navigation faces challenges in balancing efficiency and robustness in complex task environments.

Method: The method uses 'feature flow,' which maps pixel biases between matched features to robot motion. A keyframe graph is generated during the teaching phase, encoding relative motion in feature flow on its edges. During navigation, the feature flow minimization approach drives the robot using a probabilistic motion planning framework.

Result: The experiments demonstrate the proposed method's lightweight nature, robustness, and superior performance over baselines. Public access to the code ensures community utility.

Conclusion: The research offers an efficient and robust solution for mobile robot self-navigation, advancing the field by eliminating the dependency on accurate localization and dense reconstructions.

Abstract: Though visual and repeat navigation is a convenient solution for mobile robot
self-navigation, achieving balance between efficiency and robustness in task
environment still remains challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel visual
and repeat robotic autonomous navigation method that requires no accurate
localization and dense reconstruction modules, which makes our system featured
by lightweight and robustness. Firstly, feature flow is introduced and we
develop a qualitative mapping between feature flow and robot's motion, in which
feature flow is defined as pixel location bias between matched features. Based
on the mapping model, the map outputted by the teaching phase is represented as
a keyframe graph, in which the feature flow on the edge encodes the relative
motion between adjacent keyframes. Secondly, the visual repeating navigation is
essentially modeled as a feature flow minimization problem between current
observation and the map keyframe. To drive the robot to consistently reduce the
feature flow between current frame and map keyframes without accurate
localization, a probabilistic motion planning is developed based on our
qualitative feature flow-motion mapping indicator. Extensive experiments using
our mobile platform demonstrates that our proposed method is lightweight,
robust, and superior to baselines. The source code has been made public at
https://github.com/wangjks/FFI-VTR to benefit the community.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the task of Long-term Active Embodied Question Answering (LA-EQA), where robots must recall, explore, and integrate knowledge over time. The authors propose a structured memory system and stopping criteria, showing superior performance in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots are increasingly expected to operate for extended periods while gathering and using knowledge to assist humans. There is a growing need for these systems to reason across past, current, and future states, surpassing traditional methods that only focus on isolated instances.

Method: The proposed method uses a structured memory system inspired by the mind palace technique, encoding experiences as scene-graph-based instances. This allows targeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. A value-of-information-based stopping criterion is introduced to optimize the exploration-recall balance.

Result: The approach achieved significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in answer accuracy and exploration efficiency, with evaluations conducted across simulation environments and real-world industrial sites.

Conclusion: This study presents a new framework for LA-EQA tasks, showcasing the effectiveness of structured memory and decision-making algorithms in improving robot capability for long-term reasoning and exploration-oriented tasks.

Abstract: As robots become increasingly capable of operating over extended periods --
spanning days, weeks, and even months -- they are expected to accumulate
knowledge of their environments and leverage this experience to assist humans
more effectively. This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied
Question Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past
experiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,
temporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically
focus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a
single past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,
present, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult
its memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.
Standard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to
limited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to
combine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a
structured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from
cognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based
world instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables
targeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the
exploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping
criteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information. We
evaluate our method on real-world experiments and introduce a new benchmark
that spans popular simulation environments and actual industrial sites. Our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding
substantial gains in both answer accuracy and exploration efficiency.

*Rahel Rickenbach,Bruce Lee,René Zurbrügg,Carmen Amo Alonso,Melanie N. Zeilinger*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes DEMONSTRATE, a methodology integrating task embeddings and inverse optimal control to address limitations of large language models in robotic control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce reliance on engineering expertise for designing task examples required by LLMs, and to enable hallucination assessment before execution.

Method: The method leverages inverse optimal control and multitask learning to use hardware-based task demonstrations instead of in-context examples through embedding representations.

Result: Experiments with a robotic arm for tabletop manipulation showed the effectiveness of this method, allowing learning from fewer demonstrations.

Conclusion: DEMONSTRATE successfully replaces LLM-generated examples with hardware demonstrations, reducing dependence on engineers and improving hallucination evaluation capabilities.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) with control systems has
demonstrated significant potential in various settings, such as task completion
with a robotic manipulator. A main reason for this success is the ability of
LLMs to perform in-context learning, which, however, strongly relies on the
design of task examples, closely related to the target tasks. Consequently,
employing LLMs to formulate optimal control problems often requires task
examples that contain explicit mathematical expressions, designed by trained
engineers. Furthermore, there is often no principled way to evaluate for
hallucination before task execution. To address these challenges, we propose
DEMONSTRATE, a novel methodology that avoids the use of LLMs for complex
optimization problem generations, and instead only relies on the embedding
representations of task descriptions. To do this, we leverage tools from
inverse optimal control to replace in-context prompt examples with task
demonstrations, as well as the concept of multitask learning, which ensures
target and example task similarity by construction. Given the fact that
hardware demonstrations can easily be collected using teleoperation or guidance
of the robot, our approach significantly reduces the reliance on engineering
expertise for designing in-context examples. Furthermore, the enforced
multitask structure enables learning from few demonstrations and assessment of
hallucinations prior to task execution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method through simulation and hardware experiments involving a robotic arm
tasked with tabletop manipulation.

*Hayeon Oh*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents LaViPlan, a framework that improves decision-making and situational awareness in autonomous driving using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation comes from addressing out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in autonomous driving where current planners exhibit misalignment in vision-language-action reasoning, often resulting in unsafe decisions.

Method: The LaViPlan framework applies Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards to optimize Vision-Language Models using planning-oriented metrics, rectifying misalignment issues in prior supervised learning approaches.

Result: Experimental results show improved situational awareness and context-aware decision-making of autonomous systems in OOD conditions with LaViPlan.

Conclusion: LaViPlan offers a promising post-training paradigm that enhances the effectiveness of Vision-Language Models in autonomous driving, paving the way to tackle OOD handling issues effectively.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in autonomous driving refer to situations
that deviate from the training domain, often leading to unexpected and
potentially hazardous behavior from planners that lack prior exposure to such
cases. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been introduced into
autonomous driving research for their promising generalization capabilities in
OOD settings. Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD
scenarios and generate user-level decisions such as "go straight" or "turn
right." However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between
the VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and
the low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions. In this paper, we
propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics.
This approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in
existing VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving
scenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves situational awareness and decision-making
under OOD conditions, highlighting its potential to mitigate the misalignment
issue. This work introduces a promising post-training paradigm for VLM agents
in the context of autonomous driving.

*Zichao Shu,Shitao Bei,Jicheng Dai,Lijun Li,Zetao Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoCap2GT, a novel method combining MoCap data with IMU measurements to create more accurate ground truth trajectories, addressing limitations in existing SLAM benchmarking techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLAM benchmarks primarily focus on assessing absolute translation error due to challenges in accurately evaluating rotation and inter-frame errors caused by calibration errors and MoCap jitter.

Method: MoCap2GT employs a joint optimization approach with a robust initializer, B-spline pose parameterization on SE(3), variable time offsets, and degeneracy-aware rejection to refine GT trajectory computation.

Result: The method outperforms past techniques by delivering more precise GT trajectories, enabling improved SLAM evaluation.

Conclusion: MoCap2GT enhances SLAM benchmarking accuracy, addressing key limitations in trajectory generation and contributing to the field. The code is publicly accessible.

Abstract: Marker-based optical motion capture (MoCap) systems are widely used to
provide ground truth (GT) trajectories for benchmarking SLAM algorithms.
However, the accuracy of MoCap-based GT trajectories is mainly affected by two
factors: spatiotemporal calibration errors between the MoCap system and the
device under test (DUT), and inherent MoCap jitter. Consequently, existing
benchmarks focus primarily on absolute translation error, as accurate
assessment of rotation and inter-frame errors remains challenging, hindering
thorough SLAM evaluation. This paper proposes MoCap2GT, a joint optimization
approach that integrates MoCap data and inertial measurement unit (IMU)
measurements from the DUT for generating high-precision GT trajectories.
MoCap2GT includes a robust state initializer to ensure global convergence,
introduces a higher-order B-spline pose parameterization on the SE(3) manifold
with variable time offset to effectively model MoCap factors, and employs a
degeneracy-aware measurement rejection strategy to enhance estimation accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that MoCap2GT outperforms existing methods and
significantly contributes to precise SLAM benchmarking. The source code is

*Giwon Lee,Daehee Park,Jaewoo Jeong,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based approach to improve diffusion models for motion planning by optimizing safety and effectiveness, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for motion planning excel at predicting interactions but struggle with optimizing non-differentiable objectives such as collision avoidance and goal-reaching.

Method: The method leverages reinforcement learning and introduces a reward-weighted dynamic thresholding algorithm to train diffusion models on dense reward signals.

Result: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on motion planning tasks using pedestrian datasets like CrowdNav and ETH-UCY, surpassing conventional baselines.

Conclusion: Integrating reinforcement learning with diffusion models enhances their ability to handle non-differentiable safety and effectiveness measures, advancing autonomous robot motion planning.

Abstract: Safe and effective motion planning is crucial for autonomous robots.
Diffusion models excel at capturing complex agent interactions, a fundamental
aspect of decision-making in dynamic environments. Recent studies have
successfully applied diffusion models to motion planning, demonstrating their
competence in handling complex scenarios and accurately predicting multi-modal
future trajectories. Despite their effectiveness, diffusion models have
limitations in training objectives, as they approximate data distributions
rather than explicitly capturing the underlying decision-making dynamics.
However, the crux of motion planning lies in non-differentiable downstream
objectives, such as safety (collision avoidance) and effectiveness
(goal-reaching), which conventional learning algorithms cannot directly
optimize. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based training
scheme for diffusion motion planning models, enabling them to effectively learn
non-differentiable objectives that explicitly measure safety and effectiveness.
Specifically, we introduce a reward-weighted dynamic thresholding algorithm to
shape a dense reward signal, facilitating more effective training and
outperforming models trained with differentiable objectives. State-of-the-art
performance on pedestrian datasets (CrowdNav, ETH-UCY) compared to various
baselines demonstrates the versatility of our approach for safe and effective
motion planning.

*Sepeedeh Shahbeigi,Nawshin Mannan Proma,Victoria Hodge,Richard Hawkins,Boda Li,Valentina Donzella*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework combining camera noise analysis and situation coverage to define safety requirements for AI-based perception systems facing sensor degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-based systems like vehicles must ensure safe operation even with sensor degradation, yet defining safety requirements for all degradation scenarios is overly complex.

Method: The framework integrates camera noise-factor identification and situation coverage analysis, leveraging existing degradation models and input from experts.

Result: The approach systematically identifies operational contexts and extends degradation models for AI robustness analysis, particularly utilizing noise factors.

Conclusion: Initial steps are taken to enable robust and comprehensive safety requirements for AI perception systems through the combined analysis of degradation and operational situations.

Abstract: AI-based robots and vehicles are expected to operate safely in complex and
dynamic environments, even in the presence of component degradation. In such
systems, perception relies on sensors such as cameras to capture environmental
data, which is then processed by AI models to support decision-making. However,
degradation in sensor performance directly impacts input data quality and can
impair AI inference. Specifying safety requirements for all possible sensor
degradation scenarios leads to unmanageable complexity and inevitable gaps. In
this position paper, we present a novel framework that integrates camera noise
factor identification with situation coverage analysis to systematically elicit
robustness-related safety requirements for AI-based perception systems. We
focus specifically on camera degradation in the automotive domain. Building on
an existing framework for identifying degradation modes, we propose involving
domain, sensor, and safety experts, and incorporating Operational Design Domain
specifications to extend the degradation model by incorporating noise factors
relevant to AI performance. Situation coverage analysis is then applied to
identify representative operational contexts. This work marks an initial step
toward integrating noise factor analysis and situational coverage to support
principled formulation and completeness assessment of robustness requirements
for camera-based AI perception.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents VLN-PE, a realistic vision-and-language navigation (VLN) platform for evaluating robotic deployment. It identifies performance challenges in physical environments, such as limited observation and locomotion issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap between idealized VLN assumptions and the practical challenges of deploying VLN systems on physically embodied robots.

Method: The authors introduce VLN-PE, a platform that supports diverse robot types and systematically evaluates ego-centric VLN methods, including classification, diffusion, and language-model-based approaches.

Result: The study finds significant performance degradation in physical scenarios due to factors like limited observation space, lighting variations, and mechanical challenges. It also highlights constraints specific to legged robots.

Conclusion: While current VLN models struggle to generalize in real-world settings, VLN-PE creates opportunities for advancing practical VLN models and rethinking their limitations.

Abstract: Recent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) advancements are promising, but
their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect
physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce
VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and
wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several
ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical
pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action
prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free,
map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results
reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation
space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like
collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged
robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless
integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN
evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical
deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's
overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to
rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models. The code is

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the fragmented approach to trust in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), advocating for an interdisciplinary framework combining sociology and robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to better understand and define trust in the growing field of human-robot relationships, bridging gaps between current HRI research and sociology.

Method: The study brings together insights from both the social sciences and social robotics to analyze the formation, challenges, and manifestation of trust.

Result: The paper facilitates an interdisciplinary discussion and proposes a more nuanced framework for understanding trust in human-robot interactions.

Conclusion: An interdisciplinary approach is necessary to build a more robust, adaptable foundation for exploring trust in human-robot interactions.

Abstract: As robots find their way into more and more aspects of everyday life,
questions around trust are becoming increasingly important. What does it mean
to trust a robot? And how should we think about trust in relationships that
involve both humans and non-human agents? While the field of Human-Robot
Interaction (HRI) has made trust a central topic, the concept is often
approached in fragmented ways. At the same time, established work in sociology,
where trust has long been a key theme, is rarely brought into conversation with
developments in robotics. This article argues that we need a more
interdisciplinary approach. By drawing on insights from both social sciences
and social robotics, we explore how trust is shaped, tested and made visible.
Our goal is to open up a dialogue between disciplines and help build a more
grounded and adaptable framework for understanding trust in the evolving world
of human-robot interaction.

### [239] [Efficient Online Learning and Adaptive Planning for Robotic Information Gathering Based on Streaming Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13053)
*Sanjeev Ramkumar Sudha,Joel Jose,Erlend M. Coates*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents an adaptive approach utilizing streaming sparse Gaussian Processes (GPs) for robotic informative planning in mapping spatial fields, addressing scalability issues and enhancing computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic information gathering techniques face limitations in unknown or dynamic environments, particularly concerning the computational demands of Gaussian Processes for real-time mapping.

Method: The paper introduces an efficient adaptive informative planning framework that leverages streaming sparse Gaussian Processes for mapping continuous scalar fields.

Result: Simulation and real-world tests show the proposed method maintains mapping accuracy on par with benchmarks while significantly improving computational performance for extended tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses scalability and efficiency challenges in robotic information gathering, making it well-suited for real-time applications in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Robotic information gathering (RIG) techniques refer to methods where mobile
robots are used to acquire data about the physical environment with a suite of
sensors. Informative planning is an important part of RIG where the goal is to
find sequences of actions or paths that maximize efficiency or the quality of
information collected. Many existing solutions solve this problem by assuming
that the environment is known in advance. However, real environments could be
unknown or time-varying, and adaptive informative planning remains an active
area of research. Adaptive planning and incremental online mapping are required
for mapping initially unknown or varying spatial fields. Gaussian process (GP)
regression is a widely used technique in RIG for mapping continuous spatial
fields. However, it falls short in many applications as its real-time
performance does not scale well to large datasets. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes an efficient adaptive informative planning approach for
mapping continuous scalar fields with GPs with streaming sparse GPs. Simulation
experiments are performed with a synthetic dataset and compared against
existing benchmarks. Finally, it is also verified with a real-world dataset to
further validate the efficacy of the proposed method. Results show that our
method achieves similar mapping accuracy to the baselines while reducing
computational complexity for longer missions.

*Rahel Rickenbach,Alan A. Lahoud,Erik Schaffernicht,Melanie N. Zeilinger,Johannes A. Stork*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ZipMPC addresses the computational burden of long-horizon MPC by learning a compressed, context-aware cost function for short-horizon MPC, improving performance while ensuring constraint satisfaction and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the computational limitations of long-horizon MPC in real-time systems like robots, which affects control performance and complicates cost function design for long-term objectives.

Method: The paper proposes ZipMPC, which employs differentiable MPC combined with neural networks to learn and propagate gradients of a compressed, context-aware cost function optimized via imitation loss.

Result: ZipMPC demonstrates superior performance over baselines by completing tasks faster, ensuring constraint satisfaction, and successfully generalizing to unseen environments, even outperforming in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: ZipMPC effectively imitates the behavior of long-horizon MPC while maintaining computational efficiency, enhancing real-time control performance and adaptability.

Abstract: The computational burden of model predictive control (MPC) limits its
application on real-time systems, such as robots, and often requires the use of
short prediction horizons. This not only affects the control performance, but
also increases the difficulty of designing MPC cost functions that reflect the
desired long-term objective. This paper proposes ZipMPC, a method that imitates
a long-horizon MPC behaviour by learning a compressed and context-dependent
cost function for a short-horizon MPC. It improves performance over alternative
methods, such as approximate explicit MPC and automatic cost parameter tuning,
in particular in terms of i) optimizing the long term objective; ii)
maintaining computational costs comparable to a short-horizon MPC; iii)
ensuring constraint satisfaction; and iv) generalizing control behaviour to
environments not observed during training. For this purpose, ZipMPC leverages
the concept of differentiable MPC with neural networks to propagate gradients
of the imitation loss through the MPC optimization. We validate our proposed
method in simulation and real-world experiments on autonomous racing. ZipMPC
consistently completes laps faster than selected baselines, achieving lap times
close to the long-horizon MPC baseline. In challenging scenarios where the
short-horizon MPC baseline fails to complete a lap, ZipMPC is able to do so. In
particular, these performance gains are also observed on tracks unseen during
training.

TL;DR: GraspGen framework enhances robot grasping through a DiffusionTransformer, efficient discriminator, and a large-scale dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning-based 6-DOF grasping methods face challenges in generalizing across different robot setups and real-world scenarios.

Method: GraspGen incorporates a DiffusionTransformer for iterative grasp synthesis, an efficient discriminator, and a new 53+ million grasp training dataset.

Result: GraspGen surpasses existing methods in simulated tests, FetchBench benchmark, and real-world robot scenarios with noisy inputs.

Conclusion: GraspGen demonstrates superior adaptability and efficacy in diverse grasping tasks, establishing its advanced capability in robotic grasping.

Abstract: Grasping is a fundamental robot skill, yet despite significant research
advancements, learning-based 6-DOF grasping approaches are still not turnkey
and struggle to generalize across different embodiments and in-the-wild
settings. We build upon the recent success on modeling the object-centric grasp
generation process as an iterative diffusion process. Our proposed framework,
GraspGen, consists of a DiffusionTransformer architecture that enhances grasp
generation, paired with an efficient discriminator to score and filter sampled
grasps. We introduce a novel and performant on-generator training recipe for
the discriminator. To scale GraspGen to both objects and grippers, we release a
new simulated dataset consisting of over 53 million grasps. We demonstrate that
GraspGen outperforms prior methods in simulations with singulated objects
across different grippers, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
FetchBench grasping benchmark, and performs well on a real robot with noisy
visual observations.

*Suzie Kim,Hye-Bin Shin,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study introduces a reinforcement learning approach utilizing implicit human feedback from EEG signals, avoiding explicit user intervention and showing effectiveness in a robotics task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reinforcement learning's adaptability to sparse rewards without relying on manually crafted reward functions or explicit user inputs.

Method: The proposed framework decodes implicit feedback from EEG error-related potentials (ErrPs) to generate reward components, enabling policy learning that leverages these implicit signals alongside sparse external rewards.

Result: In a MuJoCo simulation involving a Kinova Gen2 robotic arm, the method performed comparably to traditional approaches with dense rewards, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Using implicit neural feedback can enhance reinforcement learning, offering a scalable and user-friendly alternative to explicit feedback mechanisms in robotics.

Abstract: Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) ap proaches often struggle to learn
effective policies under sparse reward conditions, necessitating the manual
design of complex, task-specific reward functions. To address this limitation,
rein forcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising
strategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation
signals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback
mechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the
natural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the
user. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback
(RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)
signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous,
implicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed
method adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into
probabilistic reward components, en abling effective policy learning even in
the presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a
simulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2
robotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding
obstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents
trained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those
trained with dense, manually designed rewards. These findings validate the
potential of using implicit neural feedback for scalable and human-aligned
reinforcement learning in interactive robotics.

*Marina Y. Aoyama,Sethu Vijayakumar,Tetsuya Narita*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for teaching robots tool-use skills using multimodal sensing and few-shot learning, focusing on enhancing robot manipulation abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots face challenges in tool manipulation due to the complexity of dual-contact points, limited real-world data, and significant sim-to-real gap.

Method: A few-shot tool-use skill transfer framework that pre-trains base policies in simulation and fine-tunes them with human demonstrations in the real-world using multimodal sensing.

Result: The framework is validated for surface-following tasks with diverse tools on the Franka Emika robot arm, demonstrating effective skill transfer with minimal demonstrations.

Conclusion: The study shows that combining tactile and proximity sensors significantly aids in identifying contact states, environmental geometry, and transferring tool-use abilities to robots.

Abstract: Tools extend the manipulation abilities of robots, much like they do for
humans. Despite human expertise in tool manipulation, teaching robots these
skills faces challenges. The complexity arises from the interplay of two
simultaneous points of contact: one between the robot and the tool, and another
between the tool and the environment. Tactile and proximity sensors play a
crucial role in identifying these complex contacts. However, learning tool
manipulation using these sensors remains challenging due to limited real-world
data and the large sim-to-real gap. To address this, we propose a few-shot
tool-use skill transfer framework using multimodal sensing. The framework
involves pre-training the base policy to capture contact states common in
tool-use skills in simulation and fine-tuning it with human demonstrations
collected in the real-world target domain to bridge the domain gap. We validate
that this framework enables teaching surface-following tasks using tools with
diverse physical and geometric properties with a small number of demonstrations
on the Franka Emika robot arm. Our analysis suggests that the robot acquires
new tool-use skills by transferring the ability to recognise tool-environment
contact relationships from pre-trained to fine-tuned policies. Additionally,
combining proximity and tactile sensors enhances the identification of contact
states and environmental geometry.

Result: Validation of the approach across differential-drive and quadruped robots operating under various STL specifications, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed model-free strategy reliably generates STL-compliant motion plans, ensuring compatibility with diverse environments and robot types.

Abstract: This work presents a novel co-design strategy that integrates trajectory
planning and control to handle STL-based tasks in autonomous robots. The method
consists of two phases: $(i)$ learning spatio-temporal motion primitives to
encapsulate the inherent robot-specific constraints and $(ii)$ constructing an
STL-compliant motion plan from these primitives. Initially, we employ
reinforcement learning to construct a library of control policies that perform
trajectories described by the motion primitives. Then, we map motion primitives
to spatio-temporal characteristics. Subsequently, we present a sampling-based
STL-compliant motion planning strategy tailored to meet the STL specification.
The proposed model-free approach, which generates feasible STL-compliant motion
plans across various environments, is validated on differential-drive and
quadruped robots across various STL specifications. Demonstration videos are

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper focuses on reducing the number of real-world demonstrations required to train visuomotor robot policies by utilizing optic flow-based action representations and human/robot datasets with new methods like World Model finetuning and Latent Policy Steering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation-based visuomotor policies require extensive training demonstrations, which are expensive to collect in real-world settings. The motivation is to reduce the dependency on real-world data while maintaining policy performance by using readily available multi-embodiment data sources.

Method: The method involves using optic flow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model (WM) across various datasets. This WM is fine-tuned with minimal robot data for a target robot. Additionally, Latent Policy Steering (LPS) improves the behavior-cloned policy by optimizing latent action sequences.

Result: In real-world tests, the proposed approach achieved over 50% relative improvement in policy performance with only 30 demonstrations and over 20% improvement with 50 demonstrations. The WM was pretrained on Open X-embodiment and human play datasets.

Conclusion: Leveraging multi-embodiment data sources and novel methods like World Model finetuning and Latent Policy Steering significantly reduces the need for robot-specific training data while improving policy performance in visuomotor tasks.

Abstract: Learning visuomotor policies via imitation has proven effective across a wide
range of robotic domains. However, the performance of these policies is heavily
dependent on the number of training demonstrations, which requires expensive
data collection in the real world. In this work, we aim to reduce data
collection efforts when learning visuomotor robot policies by leveraging
existing or cost-effective data from a wide range of embodiments, such as
public robot datasets and the datasets of humans playing with objects (human
data from play). Our approach leverages two key insights. First, we use optic
flow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model
(WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of
robot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent
Policy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by
searching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real
world experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of
policies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement
with 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50
demonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand
episodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different
robots or a cost-effective human dataset from play.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The diversity of Quantum SDKs hinders interoperability and cross-platform quantum-classical software development. Rule-based solutions are restrictive and time-intensive, necessitating a more scalable approach.

Method: Leverage pretrained knowledge and contextual reasoning capabilities of LLMs to function as programming-language-agnostic transpilers between QSDKs.

Result: LLMs offer a flexible, automated solution to converting quantum program code between QSDKs without requiring rigid or manually defined transformation rules.

Conclusion: Using LLMs as intelligent, general-purpose transpilers advances quantum software portability and addresses challenges in the quantum computing ecosystem.

Abstract: There exist various Software Development Kits (SDKs) tailored to different
quantum computing platforms. These are known as Quantum SDKs (QSDKs). Examples
include but are not limited to Qiskit, Cirq, and PennyLane. However, this
diversity presents significant challenges for interoperability and
cross-platform development of hybrid quantum-classical software systems.
Traditional rule-based transpilers for translating code between QSDKs are
time-consuming to design and maintain, requiring deep expertise and rigid
mappings in the source and destination code. In this study, we explore the use
of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a flexible and automated solution.
Leveraging their pretrained knowledge and contextual reasoning capabilities, we
position LLMs as programming language-agnostic transpilers capable of
converting quantum programs from one QSDK to another while preserving
functional equivalence. Our approach eliminates the need for manually defined
transformation rules and offers a scalable solution to quantum software
portability. This work represents a step toward enabling intelligent,
general-purpose transpilation in the quantum computing ecosystem.

Conclusion: Chronos represents a significant step forward in autonomous code maintenance and debugging, fostering greater software reliability and productivity through advanced, continuous optimization techniques.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced code generation and software
automation, but are fundamentally constrained by limited inference-time context
and lack of explicit code structure reasoning. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a
next-generation architecture for autonomous code understanding, debugging, and
maintenance, designed to operate across ultra-long contexts comprising entire
codebases, histories, and documentation, all without fixed window limits.
Kodezi Chronos leverages a multi-level embedding memory engine, combining
vector and graph-based indexing with continuous code-aware retrieval. This
enables efficient and accurate reasoning over millions of lines of code,
supporting repository-scale comprehension, multi-file refactoring, and
real-time self-healing actions. Our evaluation introduces a novel Multi Random
Retrieval benchmark, specifically tailored to the software engineering domain.
Unlike classical retrieval benchmarks, this method requires the model to
resolve arbitrarily distant and obfuscated associations across code artifacts,
simulating realistic tasks such as variable tracing, dependency migration, and
semantic bug localization. Chronos outperforms prior LLMs and code models,
demonstrating a 23% improvement in real-world bug detection and reducing
debugging cycles by up to 40% compared to traditional sequence-based
approaches. By natively interfacing with IDEs and CI/CD workflows, Chronos
enables seamless, autonomous software maintenance, elevating code reliability
and productivity while reducing manual effort. These results mark a critical
advance toward self-sustaining, continuously optimized software ecosystems.

Method: The paper conducts a systematic review of 115 peer-reviewed studies, categorizing SE tasks, RL algorithms, datasets, and evaluation practices, while identifying research trends and challenges.

Result: A comprehensive analysis of RL-for-SE research is presented, highlighting datasets, model optimization, and evaluation techniques, along with open challenges.

Conclusion: The survey serves as the first systematic mapping of RL applications in software engineering, providing valuable insights and a roadmap for future research and development.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for sequential
decision-making and has attracted growing interest across various domains,
particularly following the advent of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in 2015.
Simultaneously, the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
further fueled interest in integrating RL with LLMs to enable more adaptive and
intelligent systems. In the field of software engineering (SE), the increasing
complexity of systems and the rising demand for automation have motivated
researchers to apply RL to a broad range of tasks, from software design and
development to quality assurance and maintenance. Despite growing research in
RL-for-SE, there remains a lack of a comprehensive and systematic survey of
this evolving field. To address this gap, we reviewed 115 peer-reviewed studies
published across 22 premier SE venues since the introduction of DRL. We
conducted a comprehensive analysis of publication trends, categorized SE topics
and RL algorithms, and examined key factors such as dataset usage, model design
and optimization, and evaluation practices. Furthermore, we identified open
challenges and proposed future research directions to guide and inspire ongoing
work in this evolving area. To summarize, this survey offers the first
systematic mapping of RL applications in software engineering, aiming to
support both researchers and practitioners in navigating the current landscape
and advancing the field. Our artifacts are publicly available:

### [251] [When Retriever Meets Generator: A Joint Model for Code Comment Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12558)
*Tien P. T. Le,Anh M. T. Bui,Huy N. D. Pham,Alessio Bucaioni,Phuong T. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAGSum, a unified retrieval-generation framework for automatically generating source code comments, which outperforms existing methods in various languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to create concise and accurate comments for source code to ease documentation efforts and improve code comprehension, while addressing inefficiencies in current retrieval-enhanced comment generation methods.

Method: RAGSum, built on a CodeT5 backbone, integrates retrieval and generation. It uses contrastive pre-training for code embeddings, end-to-end training with a composite loss function, and a lightweight self-refinement loop.

Result: The approach performs significantly better than three established baselines on multiple programming languages (Java, Python, C) in terms of BLEU, METEOR, and ROUTE-L metrics.

Conclusion: Coupling retrieval and generation effectively within a unified framework enhances automated comment generation, encouraging future research and development in this area.

Abstract: Automatically generating concise, informative comments for source code can
lighten documentation effort and accelerate program comprehension.
Retrieval-augmented approaches first fetch code snippets with existing comments
and then synthesize a new comment, yet retrieval and generation are typically
optimized in isolation, allowing irrelevant neighbors topropagate noise
downstream. To tackle the issue, we propose a novel approach named RAGSum with
the aim of both effectiveness and efficiency in recommendations. RAGSum is
built on top offuse retrieval and generation using a single CodeT5 backbone. We
report preliminary results on a unified retrieval-generation framework built on
CodeT5. A contrastive pre-training phase shapes code embeddings for
nearest-neighbor search; these weights then seed end-to-end training with a
composite loss that (i) rewards accurate top-k retrieval; and (ii) minimizes
comment-generation error. More importantly, a lightweight self-refinement loop
is deployed to polish the final output. We evaluated theframework on three
cross-language benchmarks (Java, Python, C), and compared it with three
well-established baselines. The results show that our approach substantially
outperforms thebaselines with respect to BLEU, METEOR, and ROUTE-L. These
findings indicate that tightly coupling retrieval and generationcan raise the
ceiling for comment automation and motivateforthcoming replications and
qualitative developer studies.

*Samal Nursapa,Anastassiya Samuilova,Alessio Bucaioni. Phuong T. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes using pre-trained transformer models, CodeBERT and CodeT5, to recommend refactoring solutions for architectural smells in software systems. CodeT5 achieves high accuracy and F1 scores, outperforming its counterparts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Architectural smells degrade software quality and maintainability, yet existing tools rarely offer actionable guidance to fix detected smells.

Method: The authors fine-tuned CodeBERT and CodeT5 on over 2 million refactoring instances from open-source Java projects, framing the refactoring recommendation task as a three-class classification problem.

Result: CodeT5 achieved 96.9% accuracy and 95.2% F1 score, proving superior to CodeBERT and traditional baselines in recommending refactorings.

Conclusion: Transformer-based models can effectively bridge the gap between smell detection and actionable repair, fostering advancements in automated refactoring recommendation systems.

Abstract: Architectural smells such as God Class, Cyclic Dependency, and Hub-like
Dependency degrade software quality and maintainability. Existing tools detect
such smells but rarely suggest how to fix them. This paper explores the use of
pre-trained transformer models--CodeBERT and CodeT5--for recommending suitable
refactorings based on detected smells. We frame the task as a three-class
classification problem and fine-tune both models on over 2 million refactoring
instances mined from 11,149 open-source Java projects. CodeT5 achieves 96.9%
accuracy and 95.2% F1, outperforming CodeBERT and traditional baselines. Our
results show that transformer-based models can effectively bridge the gap
between smell detection and actionable repair, laying the foundation for future
refactoring recommendation systems. We release all code, models, and data under
an open license to support reproducibility and further research.

*Kiana Kheiri,Aamna Aamir,Andriy Miranskyy,Chen Ding*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper fine-tuned a 32B model using RL methods GRPO and ORPO to improve accuracy in generating error-resilient Qiskit code for quantum circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum circuits require error-free programming, yet current LLMs often produce flawed Qiskit code, necessitating improvements in AI coding capabilities.

Method: Fine-tuning was carried out with two reinforcement learning methods—Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO)—using a synthetic dataset enriched with annotations.

Result: On the Qiskit HumanEval benchmark, ORPO achieved 56.29% Pass@1, outperforming Granite-8B-QK by approximately 10 percentage points, while GRPO achieved 49%. Both methods surpassed general-purpose baselines. On the general HumanEval benchmark, their scores were 65.90% and 63.00%, respectively.

Conclusion: While GRPO and ORPO demonstrated significant advancements in task accuracy, room for improvement remains, especially regarding advanced programming tasks for quantum computing.

Abstract: Quantum circuits must be error-resilient, yet LLMs like Granite-20B-Code and
StarCoder often output flawed Qiskit code. We fine-tuned a 32 B model with two
RL methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Odds-Ratio Preference
Optimization (ORPO), using a richly annotated synthetic dataset. On the Qiskit
HumanEval benchmark, ORPO reaches 56.29\% Pass@1 ($\approx+10$ pp over
Granite-8B-QK) and GRPO hits 49\%, both beating all general-purpose baselines;
on the original HumanEval they score 65.90\% and 63.00\%. GRPO excels on basic
tasks (42/54), ORPO on intermediate ones (41/68), and neither solves the five
advanced tasks, highlighting clear gains yet room for progress in AI-assisted
quantum programming.

### [254] [A Three-Phase Evaluation Approach for new Information and Data Models in the Smart Grid Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12649)
*Christine van Stiphoudt,Sergio Potenciano Menci,Gilbert Fridgen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a three-phase evaluation approach combining explicit and implicit methods to evaluate new information and data models for the smart grid during the design process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for robust evaluation methods that prevent flaws in new information and data models for smart grids, as current approaches lack clear steps or a combination of explicit and implicit evaluations.

Method: The authors propose a three-phase evaluation approach using design science research, combining explicit and implicit evaluation methods during the design process of new information and data models.

Result: The approach was refined through the development of an information and data model targeting industrial flexibility descriptions, resulting in practical insights and improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed evaluation approach is effective in ensuring robust design for new information and data models, offering valuable lessons for future development in the smart grid domain.

Abstract: The ongoing digitalisation of the smart grid is resulting in an increase in
automated information exchanges across distributed energy systems. This process
has led to the development of new information and data models when the existing
ones fall short. To prevent potential disruptions caused by flaws in the newly
designed information and data models, it is essential to evaluate them during
the design process before they are implemented in operation.
  Currently, general explicit evaluation approaches outside the smart grid
domain stay at a high level without defining clear steps. Meanwhile, implicit
evaluation approaches in the smart grid domain focus on testing systems that
utilise information and data models already in use for functionality in terms
of conformance and interoperability. Notably, no combination of explicit and
implicit evaluation approaches for newly designed information and data models
offers a clearly defined set of steps during their design process in the smart
grid context.
  Consequently, we design a three-phase evaluation approach using design
science research to address this gap. Our evaluation approach combines explicit
and implicit evaluation methods and is applicable when developing new
information and data models. We use the development of an information model and
data model focused on industrial flexibility descriptions to refine our
evaluation approach. Additionally, we provide lessons learned from our
experience.

*João Granja-Correia,Remedios Hernández-Linares,Luca Ferranti,Arménio Rego*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel fuzzy logic-based method to measure project success more dynamically and accurately, focusing on user impact over secondary outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Likert-scale measures fail to capture the complex and context-dependent nature of project success.

Method: The authors introduce a hierarchical Type-1 Mamdani fuzzy logic system to prioritize sustained positive impact for end-users.

Result: The approach suggests a dynamic and potentially more accurate measurement of project success, adaptable to complex evaluations.

Conclusion: The method could improve project success evaluation but requires empirical testing and exploration of broader applications in social science.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to project success evaluation by
integrating fuzzy logic into an existing construct. Traditional Likert-scale
measures often overlook the context-dependent and multifaceted nature of
project success. The proposed hierarchical Type-1 Mamdani fuzzy system
prioritizes sustained positive impact for end-users, reducing emphasis on
secondary outcomes like stakeholder satisfaction and internal project success.
This dynamic approach may provide a more accurate measure of project success
and could be adaptable to complex evaluations. Future research will focus on
empirical testing and broader applications of fuzzy logic in social science.

*Salvador D. Escobedo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Single Conversation Methodology (SCM), a structured approach for software development with LLMs, incorporating all project stages into one continuous conversation and ensuring cognitive clarity, traceability, and documentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the passive and ad hoc usage of LLMs in software development and to endorse a structured, active developer role.

Method: SCM is a methodology that organizes project development into a single long-context conversation with defined phases, focusing on principles such as traceability, modularity, and documentation.

Result: The methodology promotes cognitive clarity and structured practices, serving as a correction to haphazard reliance on LLMs.

Conclusion: SCM advocates for a more intentional and structured way of interacting with LLMs, emphasizing the developer's role as an active architect and supervisor.

Abstract: We propose the Single Conversation Methodology (SCM), a novel and pragmatic
approach to software development using large language models (LLMs). In
contrast to ad hoc interactions with generative AI, SCM emphasizes a structured
and persistent development dialogue, where all stages of a project - from
requirements to architecture and implementation - unfold within a single,
long-context conversation. The methodology is grounded on principles of
cognitive clarity, traceability, modularity, and documentation. We define its
phases, best practices, and philosophical stance, while arguing that SCM offers
a necessary correction to the passive reliance on LLMs prevalent in current
practices. We aim to reassert the active role of the developer as architect and
supervisor of the intelligent tool.

### [257] [Investigating the Performance of Small Language Models in Detecting Test Smells in Manual Test Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13035)
*Keila Lucas,Rohit Gheyi,Márcio Ribeiro,Fabio Palomba,Luana Martins,Elvys Soares*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study explores the use of Small Language Models (SLMs) to detect and improve test smells in manual testing without extensive rule definitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual testing often suffers from quality issues like ambiguity or redundancy, reducing its reliability and maintainability.

Method: They evaluated three SLMs (Gemma3, Llama3.2, and Phi-4) on 143 Ubuntu test cases for detecting and addressing test smells.

Result: Phi-4 outperformed others with pass@2 reaching 97%, while Gemma3 and Llama3.2 achieved about 91%. SLMs also suggested autonomous improvements.

Conclusion: SLMs can be efficient tools for enhancing manual test case quality while preserving data privacy, showing promise in real-world applications.

Abstract: Manual testing, in which testers follow natural language instructions to
validate system behavior, remains crucial for uncovering issues not easily
captured by automation. However, these test cases often suffer from test
smells, quality issues such as ambiguity, redundancy, or missing checks that
reduce test reliability and maintainability. While detection tools exist, they
typically require manual rule definition and lack scalability. This study
investigates the potential of Small Language Models (SLMs) for automatically
detecting test smells. We evaluate Gemma3, Llama3.2, and Phi-4 on 143
real-world Ubuntu test cases, covering seven types of test smells. Phi-4
achieved the best results, reaching a pass@2 of 97% in detecting sentences with
test smells, while Gemma3 and Llama3.2 reached approximately 91%. Beyond
detection, SLMs autonomously explained issues and suggested improvements, even
without explicit prompt instructions. They enabled low-cost, concept-driven
identification of diverse test smells without relying on extensive rule
definitions or syntactic analysis. These findings highlight the potential of
SLMs as efficient tools that preserve data privacy and can improve test quality
in real-world scenarios.

*Dongming Jin,Weisong Sun,Jiangping Huang,Peng Liang,Jifeng Xuan,Yang Liu,Zhi Jin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes iReDev, a knowledge-driven multi-agent framework for intelligent requirements development, featuring six collaborative agents and human-in-the-loop mechanisms for better software requirements creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of time-consuming and labor-intensive requirements development and to improve support for human-agent collaboration in software development.

Method: The paper introduces iReDev, a six-agent collaborative framework using event-driven mechanisms and human-in-the-loop integration. Agents simulate stakeholders and autonomously interact based on an artifact pool to adapt to dynamic requirements.

Result: iReDev was evaluated and found to outperform existing baselines in several aspects, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating artifacts and facilitating requirements development.

Conclusion: iReDev effectively combines human knowledge with agent-based collaboration, showcasing improved efficiency and adaptability in requirements development while identifying future directions for intelligent software processes.

Abstract: Requirements development is a critical phase as it is responsible for
providing a clear understanding of what stakeholders need. It involves
collaboration among stakeholders to extract explicit requirements and address
potential conflicts, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recently,
multi-agent systems for software development have attracted much attention.
However, existing research provides limited support for requirements
development and overlooks the injection of human knowledge into agents and the
human-agent collaboration. % To address these issues, this paper proposes a
knowledge-driven multi-agent framework for intelligent requirement development,
named iReDev. iReDev features: iReDev consists of six knowledge-driven agents
to support the entire requirements development. They collaboratively perform
various tasks to produce a software requirements specification. iReDev focuses
on integrating human knowledge for agents, enabling them to simulate real-world
stakeholders. iReDev uses an event-driven communication mechanism based on an
artifact pool. Agents continuously monitor the pool and autonomously trigger
the next action based on its changes, enabling iReDev to handle new
requirements quickly. iReDev introduces a human-in-the-loop mechanism to
support human-agent collaboration, ensuring that the generated artifacts align
with the expectations of stakeholders. We evaluated the generated artifacts and
results show that iReDev outperforms existing baselines in multiple aspects. We
further envision three key directions and hope this work can facilitate the
development of intelligent requirements development.

*Dongming Jin,Zhi Jin,Linyu Li,Xiaohong Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores the challenges pretrained models present to traditional requirements engineering and proposes a new conceptual framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the growing integration of pretrained models in modern software, their distinct characteristics challenge traditional requirements engineering approaches.

Method: The authors propose a conceptual framework specifically for requirements engineering that accommodates the capabilities and complexities of pretrained model-enabled systems.

Result: The study identifies problems stemming from pretrained models’ emergent and context-dependent behaviors and proposes a tailored framework addressing these.

Conclusion: The paper calls for a shift in how requirements engineering is approached to better handle pretrained-model-enabled systems, serving as a guide for future research and practice.

Abstract: Recent advances in large pretrained models have led to their widespread
integration as core components in modern software systems. The trend is
expected to continue in the foreseeable future. Unlike traditional software
systems governed by deterministic logic, systems powered by pretrained models
exhibit distinctive and emergent characteristics, such as ambiguous capability
boundaries, context-dependent behavior, and continuous evolution. These
properties fundamentally challenge long-standing assumptions in requirements
engineering, including functional decomposability and behavioral
predictability. This paper investigates this problem and advocates for a
rethinking of existing requirements engineering methodologies. We propose a
conceptual framework tailored to requirements engineering of
pretrained-model-enabled software systems and outline several promising
research directions within this framework. This vision helps provide a guide
for researchers and practitioners to tackle the emerging challenges in
requirements engineering of pretrained-model-enabled systems.

### [260] [Inferring Attributed Grammars from Parser Implementations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13117)
*Andreas Pointner,Josef Pichler,Herbert Prähofer*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method to infer attributed grammars from recursive descent parsers by analyzing runtime behaviors, integrating syntactic and semantic specifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grammar mining often lacks focus on capturing the semantics of input processing alongside syntax. This leaves gaps in the complete understanding and specification of how inputs are processed.

Method: The approach dynamically observes the execution of recursive descent parsers to recover semantic actions and embed them into grammar rules, producing attributed grammars.

Result: The proposed method has been successfully tested on an initial set of programs, showing its ability to accurately reproduce program behavior using the inferred grammars.

Conclusion: Integrating semantic actions into grammars bridges the gap in specification recovery, paving the way for better insights into input processing systems.

Abstract: Software systems that process structured inputs often lack complete and
up-to-date specifications, which specify the input syntax and the semantics of
input processing. While grammar mining techniques have focused on recovering
syntactic structures, the semantics of input processing remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for inferring
attributed grammars from parser implementations. Given an input grammar, our
technique dynamically analyzes the implementation of recursive descent parsers
to reconstruct the semantic aspects of input handling, resulting in
specifications in the form of attributed grammars. By observing program
executions and mapping the program's runtime behavior to the grammar, we
systematically extract and embed semantic actions into the grammar rules. This
enables comprehensive specification recovery. We demonstrate the feasibility of
our approach using an initial set of programs, showing that it can accurately
reproduce program behavior through the generated attributed grammars.

*Xin Yin,Xinrui Li,Chao Ni,Xiaodan Xu,Xiaohu Yang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces CodeGPTSensor+, an improved model for detecting LLM-generated code, particularly when the code undergoes minor modifications, enhancing robustness against adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the increasing use of LLM-generated code, challenges like code ownership, quality, and regulation have arisen. Detecting modified LLM-generated code is vital as existing solutions show limited robustness in such scenarios.

Method: CodeGPTSensor+ employs adversarial training and a module called Multi-objective Identifier and Structure Transformation (MIST) to generate diverse and representative adversarial samples, enhancing the model's capability to resist modifications.

Result: Experiments on the HMCorp dataset show that CodeGPTSensor+ achieves better detection accuracy on adversarially modified LLM-generated code while retaining high performance on unaltered code.

Conclusion: CodeGPTSensor+ effectively addresses the challenge of detecting modified LLM-generated code and demonstrates superior robustness, making it a valuable tool for the responsible use of such code in the real world.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), their powerful
code-generation capabilities have been widely applied in tasks like code
completion and automated development, demonstrating the value of improving
coding efficiency. However, the extensive use of LLM-generated code also raises
several new challenges. On the one hand, issues such as the regulation of code
provenance, copyright disputes, and code quality have become increasingly
concerning. How to effectively detect LLM-generated code and ensure its
compliant and responsible use has become a critical and urgent issue. On the
other hand, in practical applications, LLM-generated code is often subject to
manual modifications, such as variable renaming or structural adjustments.
Although some recent studies have proposed training-based and zero-shot methods
for detecting LLM-generated code, these approaches show insufficient robustness
when facing modified LLM-generated code, and there is a lack of an effective
solution. To address the real-world scenario where LLM-generated code may
undergo minor modifications, we propose CodeGPTSensor+, an enhanced version of
CodeGPTSensor, which employs adversarial training to improve robustness against
input perturbations. CodeGPTSensor+ integrates an adversarial sample generation
module, Multi-objective Identifier and Structure Transformation (MIST), which
systematically generates both high-quality and representative adversarial
samples. This module effectively enhances the model's resistance against
diverse adversarial attacks. Experimental results on the HMCorp dataset
demonstrate that CodeGPTSensor+ significantly improves detection accuracy on
the adversarial test set while maintaining high accuracy on the original test
set, showcasing superior robustness compared to CodeGPTSensor.

*Mia-Katrin Kvalsund,Mikkel Elle Lepperød*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper reviews AI architectures inspired by the brain's minicolumn hypothesis, emphasizing repeated neural modules as a path to robust and efficient systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in understanding between the biological brain's neocortex as a model for advanced AI and current neural architectures, addressing challenges like scalability, energy efficiency, and adaptability.

Method: Synthesizing insights from historical, theoretical, and methodological perspectives to analyze the role of module repetition in neural architectures.

Result: Evidence indicates that repeated modules tend to become generalist problem solvers, showcasing robustness, adaptability, and efficiency with potential to generalize to out-of-distribution problems.

Conclusion: Repetition-based architectures inspired by the brain hold untapped potential for addressing key AI challenges, though more theoretical work is needed to solidify findings.

Abstract: While modern AI continues to advance, the biological brain remains the
pinnacle of neural networks in its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency.
This review explores an AI architectural path inspired by the brain's
structure, particularly the minicolumn hypothesis, which views the neocortex as
a distributed system of repeated modules - a structure we connect to collective
intelligence (CI). Despite existing work, there is a lack of comprehensive
reviews connecting the cortical column to the architectures of repeated neural
modules. This review aims to fill that gap by synthesizing historical,
theoretical, and methodological perspectives on neural module repetition. We
distinguish between architectural repetition - reusing structure - and
parameter-shared module repetition, where the same functional unit is repeated
across a network. The latter exhibits key CI properties such as robustness,
adaptability, and generalization. Evidence suggests that the repeated module
tends to converge toward a generalist module: simple, flexible problem solvers
capable of handling many roles in the ensemble. This generalist tendency may
offer solutions to longstanding challenges in modern AI: improved energy
efficiency during training through simplicity and scalability, and robust
embodied control via generalization. While empirical results suggest such
systems can generalize to out-of-distribution problems, theoretical results are
still lacking. Overall, architectures featuring module repetition remain an
emerging and unexplored architectural strategy, with significant untapped
potential for both efficiency, robustness, and adaptiveness. We believe that a
system that adopts the benefits of CI, while adhering to architectural and
functional principles of the minicolumns, could challenge the modern AI
problems of scalability, energy consumption, and democratization.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a biologically plausible oscillating Topological Neighbourhood (TN) modification to Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) for modelling neurodevelopmental disorders like autism and schizophrenia and demonstrates its computational and neuroscientific validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the biological plausibility of Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) for better cognitive modelling, particularly of neurodevelopmental disorders like autism and schizophrenia.

Method: A modified SOM network with oscillating Topological Neighbourhood (TN) was developed. This approach, alongside standard SOMs, was used to model the disorders, employing targeted TN width function modifications and computer simulations based on revised IPSOM models.

Result: The oscillating-TN SOM showed strong similarities to standard SOM in behavior, output, and structure while providing a more realistic representation of brain function.

Conclusion: The study supports the oscillating-TN SOM as a valid and more biologically realistic computational model for cognitive processes and neurodevelopmental disorders.

Abstract: Background/Introduction: In this paper, the neural network class of
Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) is investigated in terms of its theoretical and
applied validity for cognitive modelling, particularly of neurodevelopmental
disorders.
  Methods: A modified SOM network type, with increased biological plausibility,
incorporating a type of cortical columnar oscillation in the form of an
oscillating Topological Neighbourhood (TN), is introduced and applied alongside
the standard SOM. Aspects of two neurodevelopmental disorders, autism and
schizophrenia, are modelled using SOM networks, based on existing
neurocomputational theories. Both standard and oscillating-TN SOM training is
employed with targeted modifications in the TN width function. Computer
simulations are conducted using revised versions of a previously introduced
model (IPSOM) based on a new modelling hypothesis.
  Results/Conclusions: The results demonstrate that there is strong similarity
between standard and oscillating-TN SOM modelling in terms of map formation
behaviour, output and structure, while the oscillating version offers a more
realistic computational analogue of brain function. Neuroscientific and
computational arguments are presented to validate the proposed SOM modification
within a cognitive modelling framework.

*David Freire-Obregón,Agnieszka Dubiel,Prasoon Kumar Vinodkumar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari,Dorota Kamińska,Modesto Castrillón-Santana*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces an interpretable framework for dual-stream EEG classifiers, adapting LIME to handle bi-hemispheric inputs for better understanding emotion recognition decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretability remains a challenge for bi-hemispheric EEG-based emotion recognition models, limiting their usability in sensitive fields.

Method: The paper extends the LIME approach to dual-stream EEG models by enabling structured, hemispheric-specific decomposition of prediction relevance across EEG channels.

Result: The explanations derived from their framework align with known neurophysiological patterns, like frontal lateralization for joy and posterior asymmetry for sadness, and offer insights into hemispheric-specific activation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances interpretability for EEG-based emotion recognition models, providing neuroscientifically relevant insights into model decisions and supporting lateralization findings in affective neuroscience.

Abstract: Recent advances have shown promise in emotion recognition from
electroencephalogram (EEG) signals by employing bi-hemispheric neural
architectures that incorporate neuroscientific priors into deep learning
models. However, interpretability remains a significant limitation for their
application in sensitive fields such as affective computing and cognitive
modeling. In this work, we introduce a post-hoc interpretability framework
tailored to dual-stream EEG classifiers, extending the Local Interpretable
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) approach to accommodate structured,
bi-hemispheric inputs. Our method adapts LIME to handle structured two-branch
inputs corresponding to left and right-hemisphere EEG channel groups. It
decomposes prediction relevance into per-channel contributions across
hemispheres and emotional classes. We apply this framework to a previously
validated dual-branch recurrent neural network trained on EmoNeuroDB, a dataset
of EEG recordings captured during a VR-based emotion elicitation task. The
resulting explanations reveal emotion-specific hemispheric activation patterns
consistent with known neurophysiological phenomena, such as frontal
lateralization in joy and posterior asymmetry in sadness. Furthermore, we
aggregate local explanations across samples to derive global channel importance
profiles, enabling a neurophysiologically grounded interpretation of the
model's decisions. Correlation analysis between symmetric electrodes further
highlights the model's emotion-dependent lateralization behavior, supporting
the functional asymmetries reported in affective neuroscience.

*Yuki Tomoda,Ichiro Tsuda,Yutaka Yamaguti*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study shows that reducing mutual information in neural networks encourages functional differentiation, aiding tasks and highlighting that functional changes precede structural ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to understand how functional differentiation arises in the brain and artificial neural systems, as it is crucial for grasping the brain's complexity.

Method: The researchers minimized mutual information between subgroups in recurrent neural networks using mutual information neural estimation and tested this on working memory and chaotic signal analysis tasks.

Result: The networks achieved strong task performance with noticeable functional modularity and structural modularity, where functional differentiation developed earlier than structural reorganization.

Conclusion: Functional differentiation likely drives structural reorganization, guided by information-theoretic principles, offering insights into neural and artificial brain development.

Abstract: Functional differentiation in the brain emerges as distinct regions
specialize and is key to understanding brain function as a complex system.
Previous research has modeled this process using artificial neural networks
with specific constraints. Here, we propose a novel approach that induces
functional differentiation in recurrent neural networks by minimizing mutual
information between neural subgroups via mutual information neural estimation.
We apply our method to a 2-bit working memory task and a chaotic signal
separation task involving Lorenz and R\"ossler time series. Analysis of network
performance, correlation patterns, and weight matrices reveals that mutual
information minimization yields high task performance alongside clear
functional modularity and moderate structural modularity. Importantly, our
results show that functional differentiation, which is measured through
correlation structures, emerges earlier than structural modularity defined by
synaptic weights. This suggests that functional specialization precedes and
probably drives structural reorganization within developing neural networks.
Our findings provide new insights into how information-theoretic principles may
govern the emergence of specialized functions and modular structures during
artificial and biological brain development.

*Pardha Sai Krishna Ala,Ameya Salvi,Venkat Krovi,Matthias Schmid*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper presents a learning-based approach for identifying noise characteristics in state estimation processes, aiming to improve accuracy and prevent filter divergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating noise characteristics, crucial for state estimation accuracy, remains a challenge due to uncertainties in process and measurement models. Current methods are limited and often require experienced designers.

Method: A learning-based methodology employing various loss functions is proposed to identify noise characteristics, with its performance tested on real-time vehicle state estimation.

Result: The approach demonstrated its capability in effectively identifying noise characteristics and performing real-time state estimation for vehicles.

Conclusion: Learning-based methods can serve as viable alternatives to traditional techniques for improving noise identification and enhancing state estimation reliability.

Abstract: Accurate state estimation requires careful consideration of uncertainty
surrounding the process and measurement models; these characteristics are
usually not well-known and need an experienced designer to select the
covariance matrices. An error in the selection of covariance matrices could
impact the accuracy of the estimation algorithm and may sometimes cause the
filter to diverge. Identifying noise characteristics has long been a
challenging problem due to uncertainty surrounding noise sources and
difficulties in systematic noise modeling. Most existing approaches try
identifying unknown covariance matrices through an optimization algorithm
involving innovation sequences. In recent years, learning approaches have been
utilized to determine the stochastic characteristics of process and measurement
models. We present a learning-based methodology with different loss functions
to identify noise characteristics and test these approaches' performance for
real-time vehicle state estimation

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper studies Gaussian approximations of finite-dimensional distributions (FDDs) in deep neural networks with random initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the probabilistic behavior and convergence properties of deep neural networks with random weights is critical for theoretical advancements and practical applications.

Method: The authors analyze the Wasserstein-1 norm bounds between FDDs and their Gaussian limit, assuming a Lipschitz activation function and scaling the layer widths to infinity under arbitrary rates.

Result: A convergence rate of order $n^{-({1}/{6})^{L-1} + \epsilon}$ for $L-1$ hidden layers was obtained when widths scale proportionally to a common parameter.

Conclusion: Gaussian approximations accurately describe the FDDs of randomly initialized deep neural networks under specified conditions and scaling limits.

Abstract: We study the Finite-Dimensional Distributions (FDDs) of deep neural networks
with randomly initialized weights that have finite-order moments. Specifically,
we establish Gaussian approximation bounds in the Wasserstein-$1$ norm between
the FDDs and their Gaussian limit assuming a Lipschitz activation function and
allowing the layer widths to grow to infinity at arbitrary relative rates. In
the special case where all widths are proportional to a common scale parameter
$n$ and there are $L-1$ hidden layers, we obtain convergence rates of order
$n^{-({1}/{6})^{L-1} + \epsilon}$, for any $\epsilon > 0$.

### [268] [Self Balancing Neural Network: A Novel Method to Estimate Average Treatment Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12818)
*Atomsa Gemechu Abdisa,Yingchun Zhou,Yuqi Qiu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method, the "Self-balancing neural network" (Sbnet), to address confounding biases in observational studies, improving accuracy in estimating the average treatment effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Observational studies face bias in estimating average treatment effects due to confounding variables and instrumental factors, unlike randomized controlled trials. Current methods relying on estimated propensity scores are prone to errors due to model misspecification.

Method: The paper proposes Sbnet, a neural network framework that integrates a balancing net to autonomously calculate pseudo propensity scores, eliminating reliance on potentially flawed predefined models. It includes a multi-pseudo propensity score framework to improve estimation accuracy.

Result: Sbnet demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across three simulation setups and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The Sbnet approach effectively reduces bias and improves accuracy in estimating average treatment effects, offering a robust alternative to traditional methods in observational studies.

Abstract: In observational studies, confounding variables affect both treatment and
outcome. Moreover, instrumental variables also influence the treatment
assignment mechanism. This situation sets the study apart from a standard
randomized controlled trial, where the treatment assignment is random. Due to
this situation, the estimated average treatment effect becomes biased. To
address this issue, a standard approach is to incorporate the estimated
propensity score when estimating the average treatment effect. However, these
methods incur the risk of misspecification in propensity score models. To solve
this issue, a novel method called the "Self balancing neural network" (Sbnet),
which lets the model itself obtain its pseudo propensity score from the
balancing net, is proposed in this study. The proposed method estimates the
average treatment effect by using the balancing net as a key part of the
feedforward neural network. This formulation resolves the estimation of the
average treatment effect in one step. Moreover, the multi-pseudo propensity
score framework, which is estimated from the diversified balancing net and used
for the estimation of the average treatment effect, is presented. Finally, the
proposed methods are compared with state-of-the-art methods on three simulation
setups and real-world datasets. It has been shown that the proposed
self-balancing neural network shows better performance than state-of-the-art
methods.

*Yaniv Shulman*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian framework for identifying Linear Time-Variant (LTV) systems using input-output data, leveraging modern machine learning methods for robust and flexible inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenging inverse problem of identifying LTV systems from noisy data, aiming to improve robustness and uncertainty quantification in dynamic environments.

Method: The authors propose modeling the system's impulse response as a stochastic process and employ Bayesian approaches like Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian Processes with scalable variational inference.

Result: The framework demonstrated robust inference capabilities, improved data efficiency over classical methods in specific applications, and effectively tracked varying LTV impulse responses.

Conclusion: This Bayesian framework offers a principled, uncertainty-aware, and data-efficient methodology for identifying and analyzing dynamic systems in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: The identification of Linear Time-Variant (LTV) systems from input-output
data is a fundamental yet challenging ill-posed inverse problem. This work
introduces a unified Bayesian framework that models the system's impulse
response, $h(t, \tau)$, as a stochastic process. We decompose the response into
a posterior mean and a random fluctuation term, a formulation that provides a
principled approach for quantifying uncertainty and naturally defines a new,
useful system class we term Linear Time-Invariant in Expectation (LTIE). To
perform inference, we leverage modern machine learning techniques, including
Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian Processes, using scalable variational
inference. We demonstrate through a series of experiments that our framework
can robustly infer the properties of an LTI system from a single noisy
observation, show superior data efficiency compared to classical methods in a
simulated ambient noise tomography problem, and successfully track a
continuously varying LTV impulse response by using a structured Gaussian
Process prior. This work provides a flexible and robust methodology for
uncertainty-aware system identification in dynamic environments.

### [270] [When Pattern-by-Pattern Works: Theoretical and Empirical Insights for Logistic Models with Missing Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13024)
*Christophe Muller,Erwan Scornet,Julie Josse*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates predicting outcomes with partially missing inputs, specifically in logistic regression models. It explores the challenges, proposes the Pattern-by-Pattern (PbP) strategy, and evaluates it against other methods like imputation and EM algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of predicting outcomes when inputs are partially missing, especially in logistic regression models, which require strategies beyond parameter estimation.

Method: The study proposes a Pattern-by-Pattern (PbP) approach that builds separate models for each missing data pattern, tests its theoretical validity, and compares it empirically with other methods like imputations, EM algorithms, and complete case analysis.

Result: PbP is shown to provide accurate Bayes probabilities in various missingness scenarios, while mean imputation works well for small datasets. MICE.RF.Y performs better with non-linear relationships, especially with larger samples.

Conclusion: PbP is the most effective method for Gaussian mixtures with large samples, while MICE.RF.Y is recommended for datasets with nonlinear features and missing data scenarios.

Abstract: Predicting a response with partially missing inputs remains a challenging
task even in parametric models, since parameter estimation in itself is not
sufficient to predict on partially observed inputs. Several works study
prediction in linear models. In this paper, we focus on logistic models, which
present their own difficulties. From a theoretical perspective, we prove that a
Pattern-by-Pattern strategy (PbP), which learns one logistic model per
missingness pattern, accurately approximates Bayes probabilities in various
missing data scenarios (MCAR, MAR and MNAR). Empirically, we thoroughly compare
various methods (constant and iterative imputations, complete case analysis,
PbP, and an EM algorithm) across classification, probability estimation,
calibration, and parameter inference. Our analysis provides a comprehensive
view on the logistic regression with missing values. It reveals that mean
imputation can be used as baseline for low sample sizes, and improved
performance is obtained via nonlinear multiple iterative imputation techniques
with the labels (MICE.RF.Y). For large sample sizes, PbP is the best method for
Gaussian mixtures, and we recommend MICE.RF.Y in presence of nonlinear
features.

### [271] [Relation-Aware Slicing in Cross-Domain Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13194)
*Dhruv Sarkar,Aprameyo Chakrabartty,Anish Chakrabarty,Swagatam Das*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Relation-Aware Slicing Distribution (RASD) and Relation-Aware Projecting Direction (RAPD) to address inefficiencies in the Sliced Gromov-Wasserstein (SGW) distance by optimizing the distribution of projecting directions. It achieves faster sampling and better alignment task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SGW distance methods suffer from computational inefficiencies and lack representative power due to random uninformative slicing directions. Enhancing the slicing distribution can address these issues with better alignment tasks.

Method: The authors introduce RAPD to capture pairwise associations more effectively and derive RASD for fast Monte Carlo sampling without the need for costly optimization. They propose the RASGW distance and variants, e.g., IWRASGW.

Result: RASGW achieves improved computational efficiency and alignment task performance, validated through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments.

Conclusion: RASGW and its variants overcome SGW's limitations and provide a computationally and performatively superior methodology for alignment tasks.

Abstract: The Sliced Gromov-Wasserstein (SGW) distance, aiming to relieve the
computational cost of solving a non-convex quadratic program that is the
Gromov-Wasserstein distance, utilizes projecting directions sampled uniformly
from unit hyperspheres. This slicing mechanism incurs unnecessary computational
costs due to uninformative directions, which also affects the representative
power of the distance. However, finding a more appropriate distribution over
the projecting directions (slicing distribution) is often an optimization
problem in itself that comes with its own computational cost. In addition, with
more intricate distributions, the sampling itself may be expensive. As a
remedy, we propose an optimization-free slicing distribution that provides fast
sampling for the Monte Carlo approximation. We do so by introducing the
Relation-Aware Projecting Direction (RAPD), effectively capturing the pairwise
association of each of two pairs of random vectors, each following their
ambient law. This enables us to derive the Relation-Aware Slicing Distribution
(RASD), a location-scale law corresponding to sampled RAPDs. Finally, we
introduce the RASGW distance and its variants, e.g., IWRASGW (Importance
Weighted RASGW), which overcome the shortcomings experienced by SGW. We
theoretically analyze its properties and substantiate its empirical prowess
using extensive experiments on various alignment tasks.

*Md. Tanvir Alam,Md. Ahasanul Alam,Md Mahmudur Rahman,Md. Mosaddek Khan*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper presents rel-HNN, a hypergraph-based framework to capture fine-grained relationships in relational databases (RDBs), addressing scalability through split-parallel training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models and Graph Neural Networks face challenges in accurately capturing relational semantics and intra-tuple associations in RDBs, necessitating a more nuanced approach.

Method: The paper proposes rel-HNN, which models attribute-value pairs as nodes and tuples as hyperedges, incorporating multi-level representations at the attribute-value, tuple, and table levels. It also introduces a split-parallel training algorithm for efficient multi-GPU execution.

Result: The framework outperforms existing methods in classification and regression tasks on real-world and benchmark datasets, achieving significant training speedups of up to 3.18x for relational data and 2.94x for hypergraph learning tasks.

Conclusion: rel-HNN effectively models intricate relational structures and demonstrates both improved accuracy and scalability, making it a robust solution for deep learning on RDBs.

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) are ubiquitous in enterprise and real-world
applications. Flattening the database poses challenges for deep learning models
that rely on fixed-size input representations to capture relational semantics
from the structured nature of relational data. Graph neural networks (GNNs)
have been proposed to address this, but they often oversimplify relational
structures by modeling all the tuples as monolithic nodes and ignoring
intra-tuple associations. In this work, we propose a novel hypergraph-based
framework, that we call rel-HNN, which models each unique attribute-value pair
as a node and each tuple as a hyperedge, enabling the capture of fine-grained
intra-tuple relationships. Our approach learns explicit multi-level
representations across attribute-value, tuple, and table levels. To address the
scalability challenges posed by large RDBs, we further introduce a
split-parallel training algorithm that leverages multi-GPU execution for
efficient hypergraph learning. Extensive experiments on real-world and
benchmark datasets demonstrate that rel-HNN significantly outperforms existing
methods in both classification and regression tasks. Moreover, our
split-parallel training achieves substantial speedups -- up to 3.18x for
learning on relational data and up to 2.94x for hypergraph learning -- compared
to conventional single-GPU execution.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for converting real-world soccer data into object-centric event logs with added spatial dimensions and evaluates its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the scarcity of real-world object-centric event logs and to explore their usefulness by leveraging football (soccer) data as a novel and suitable domain.

Method: The authors present a framework to transform football data into object-centric event logs with spatial dimensions and validate it with real-world soccer data, exploring different process representations.

Result: The framework successfully generated object-centric event logs from football data and offered insights into handling varying process representations.

Conclusion: This study lays the groundwork for object-centric event logs in football analytics and highlights the need for future work on variant analysis and filtering techniques to manage variability.

Abstract: Object-centric event logs expand the conventional single-case notion event
log by considering multiple objects, allowing for the analysis of more complex
and realistic process behavior. However, the number of real-world
object-centric event logs remains limited, and further studies are needed to
test their usefulness. The increasing availability of data from team sports can
facilitate object-centric process mining, leveraging both real-world data and
suitable use cases. In this paper, we present a framework for transforming
football (soccer) data into an object-centric event log, further enhanced with
a spatial dimension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by
generating object-centric event logs based on real-world football data and
discuss the results for varying process representations. With our paper, we
provide the first example for object-centric event logs in football analytics.
Future work should consider variant analysis and filtering techniques to better
handle variability

### [274] [On Accelerated Mixing of the No-U-turn Sampler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13259)
*Stefan Oberdörster*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper examines the No-U-turn Sampler, an automated method for Randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, offering a rigorous study of its convergence acceleration capabilities using theoretical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual critical tuning of Randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is impractical, necessitating automated solutions like the No-U-turn Sampler. However, there is a lack of theoretical understanding of its performance.

Method: The authors use a concentration of measure approach and coupling-based mixing analysis to study the automatic tuning mechanism of the No-U-turn Sampler in Gaussian target distributions.

Result: The authors provide a precise characterization of the sampler's behavior, including rigorous mixing guarantees, which describe its ability and limitations in achieving accelerated convergence.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of the No-U-turn Sampler by offering a theoretical framework for its performance, highlighting the potential and constraints of accelerated convergence in specific scenarios.

Abstract: Recent progress on the theory of variational hypocoercivity established that
Randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo -- at criticality -- can achieve pronounced
acceleration in its convergence and hence sampling performance over diffusive
dynamics. Manual critical tuning being unfeasible in practice has motivated
automated algorithmic solutions, notably the No-U-turn Sampler. Beyond its
empirical success, a rigorous study of this method's ability to achieve
accelerated convergence has been missing. We initiate this investigation
combining a concentration of measure approach to examine the automatic tuning
mechanism with a coupling based mixing analysis for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. In
certain Gaussian target distributions, this yields a precise characterization
of the sampler's behavior resulting, in particular, in rigorous mixing
guarantees describing the algorithm's ability and limitations in achieving
accelerated convergence.

TL;DR: This paper introduces UniSLU, a unified generative framework for managing multiple spoken language understanding tasks within a single architecture, improving task interaction and leveraging heterogeneous datasets for enhanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLU methods often rely on separate architectures for tasks, increasing complexity and restricting cross-task interactions while failing to fully utilize heterogeneous datasets.

Method: The authors propose UniSLU, a unified framework with unified representations and generative methods to jointly model tasks like ASR, spoken NER, and SA, integrating seamlessly with large language models.

Result: UniSLU demonstrated superior performance in SLU tasks compared to benchmark methods through experiments on public datasets.

Conclusion: UniSLU simplifies multimodal task setups, enhances task interaction, and is effective for real-world multimedia applications, marking an advancement in SLU technologies.

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) plays a crucial role in speech-centric
multimedia applications, enabling machines to comprehend spoken language in
scenarios such as meetings, interviews, and customer service interactions. SLU
encompasses multiple tasks, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),
spoken Named Entity Recognition (NER), and spoken Sentiment Analysis (SA).
However, existing methods often rely on separate model architectures for
individual tasks such as spoken NER and SA, which increases system complexity,
limits cross-task interaction, and fails to fully exploit heterogeneous
datasets available across tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
UniSLU, a unified framework that jointly models multiple SLU tasks within a
single architecture. Specifically, we propose a unified representation for
diverse SLU tasks, enabling full utilization of heterogeneous datasets across
multiple tasks. Built upon this representation, we propose a unified generative
method that jointly models ASR, spoken NER, and SA tasks, enhancing task
interactions and enabling seamless integration with large language models to
harness their powerful generative capabilities. Extensive experiments on public
SLU datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior
SLU performance compared to several benchmark methods, making it well-suited
for real-world speech-based multimedia scenarios. We will release all code and
models at github to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: This paper uses model checking to verify correctness in mutual exclusion algorithms, addressing both atomic and non-atomic read/write registers, while employing justness as a criterion for eliminating false counterexamples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the reliability of various mutual exclusion algorithms under different shared communication conditions and eliminate spurious counterexamples using a clear completeness criterion.

Method: Model checking of mutual exclusion algorithms, applying the concept of justness as a completeness criterion, under different concurrency relations.

Result: Executions were presented showing violations of correctness in some algorithms; in certain cases, improvements were suggested.

Conclusion: The study identifies correctness violations in specific mutual exclusion algorithms and demonstrates the usefulness of justness in ensuring comprehensive verification, with suggested corrections where applicable.

Abstract: We verify the correctness of a variety of mutual exclusion algorithms through
model checking. We look at algorithms where communication is via shared
read/write registers, where those registers can be atomic or non-atomic. For
the verification of liveness properties, it is necessary to assume a
completeness criterion to eliminate spurious counterexamples. We use justness
as completeness criterion. Justness depends on a concurrency relation; we
consider several such relations, modelling different assumptions on the working
of the shared registers. We present executions demonstrating the violation of
correctness properties by several algorithms, and in some cases suggest
improvements.

*Ogonnaya M. Romanus,Roberto Molinari*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Private Conformity via Quantile Search" (P-COQS), a general Differential Privacy (DP) approach for Conformal Prediction (CP) that ensures privacy during the calibration phase while producing accurate prediction sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Differential Privacy approaches focus on privacy leakage related to training but rarely on privacy impacts during calibration datasets, which are essential for uncertainty quantification in methods like Conformal Prediction.

Method: The approach adapts a randomized binary search algorithm to compute DP quantiles in CP's calibration phase, thereby ensuring privacy while generating conformal prediction sets.

Result: P-COQS achieves robustness to privacy noise and favorable empirical results across several assessments, producing smaller prediction sets while maintaining the desired privacy and coverage guarantees.

Conclusion: P-COQS is a promising DP approach that improves efficiency and informativeness of conformal prediction sets while offering reliable privacy guarantees, as demonstrated across benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Most Differentially Private (DP) approaches focus on limiting privacy leakage
from learners based on the data that they are trained on, there are fewer
approaches that consider leakage when procedures involve a calibration dataset
which is common in uncertainty quantification methods such as Conformal
Prediction (CP). Since there is a limited amount of approaches in this
direction, in this work we deliver a general DP approach for CP that we call
Private Conformity via Quantile Search (P-COQS). The proposed approach adapts
an existing randomized binary search algorithm for computing DP quantiles in
the calibration phase of CP thereby guaranteeing privacy of the consequent
prediction sets. This however comes at a price of slightly under-covering with
respect to the desired $(1 - \alpha)$-level when using finite-sample
calibration sets (although broad empirical results show that the P-COQS
generally targets the required level in the considered cases). Confirming
properties of the adapted algorithm and quantifying the approximate coverage
guarantees of the consequent CP, we conduct extensive experiments to examine
the effects of privacy noise, sample size and significance level on the
performance of our approach compared to existing alternatives. In addition, we
empirically evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets, including
CIFAR-10, ImageNet and CoronaHack. Our results suggest that the proposed method
is robust to privacy noise and performs favorably with respect to the current
DP alternative in terms of empirical coverage, efficiency, and informativeness.
Specifically, the results indicate that P-COQS produces smaller conformal
prediction sets while simultaneously targeting the desired coverage and privacy
guarantees in all these experimental settings.

### [278] [Cross-World Assumption and Refining Prediction Intervals for Individual Treatment Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12581)
*Juraj Bodik,Yaxuan Huang,Bin Yu*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of quantifying uncertainty in individual treatment effects (ITE) and proposes a method using bounded cross-world correlation assumptions to create prediction intervals that are precise and reliable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for assessing treatment effects fail to provide reliable uncertainty estimates for individual-level predictions, which is critical for high-stakes decision-making.

Method: The authors introduce and leverage a cross-world correlation parameter, $\rho(x)$, combining domain-informed bounds and Gaussian assumptions to design prediction intervals for ITE with improved accuracy.

Result: The proposed prediction intervals achieve a substantial reduction in width (less than 1/3 of competing methods) while maintaining accurate coverage guarantees and asymptotic optimality under Gaussian assumptions.

Conclusion: Using domain-informed assumptions about cross-world correlation, valid and compact prediction intervals for individual treatment effects can be derived, offering both statistical rigor and practical utility.

Abstract: While average treatment effects (ATE) and conditional average treatment
effects (CATE) provide valuable population- and subgroup-level summaries, they
fail to capture uncertainty at the individual level. For high-stakes
decision-making, individual treatment effect (ITE) estimates must be
accompanied by valid prediction intervals that reflect heterogeneity and
unit-specific uncertainty. However, the fundamental unidentifiability of ITEs
limits the ability to derive precise and reliable individual-level uncertainty
estimates. To address this challenge, we investigate the role of a cross-world
correlation parameter, $ \rho(x) = cor(Y(1), Y(0) | X = x) $, which describes
the dependence between potential outcomes, given covariates, in the
Neyman-Rubin super-population model with i.i.d. units. Although $ \rho $ is
fundamentally unidentifiable, we argue that in most real-world applications, it
is possible to impose reasonable and interpretable bounds informed by
domain-expert knowledge. Given $\rho$, we design prediction intervals for ITE,
achieving more stable and accurate coverage with substantially shorter widths;
often less than 1/3 of those from competing methods. The resulting intervals
satisfy coverage guarantees $P\big(Y(1) - Y(0) \in C_{ITE}(X)\big) \geq 1 -
\alpha$ and are asymptotically optimal under Gaussian assumptions. We provide
strong theoretical and empirical arguments that cross-world assumptions can
make individual uncertainty quantification both practically informative and
statistically valid.

TL;DR: RIDER is a machine learning framework designed to optimize empirical risk minimization under temporal distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of machine learning models struggling in dynamically evolving environments with temporal distribution shifts.

Method: Developed a randomized distribution shift model to theoretically ground RIDER and integrate various common weighting schemes into its framework.

Result: RIDER demonstrates improved predictive performance on datasets like Yearbook and outperforms existing strategies in real-world applications like stock market volatility prediction and NYC taxi ride duration forecasting.

Conclusion: RIDER provides a robust methodology for fine-tuning machine learning models to handle dynamically evolving data distributions and improve out-of-sample predictions.

Abstract: Temporal distribution shifts pose a key challenge for machine learning models
trained and deployed in dynamically evolving environments. This paper
introduces RIDER (RIsk minimization under Dynamically Evolving Regimes) which
derives optimally-weighted empirical risk minimization procedures under
temporal distribution shifts. Our approach is theoretically grounded in the
random distribution shift model, where random shifts arise as a superposition
of numerous unpredictable changes in the data-generating process. We show that
common weighting schemes, such as pooling all data, exponentially weighting
data, and using only the most recent data, emerge naturally as special cases in
our framework. We demonstrate that RIDER consistently improves out-of-sample
predictive performance when applied as a fine-tuning step on the Yearbook
dataset, across a range of benchmark methods in Wild-Time. Moreover, we show
that RIDER outperforms standard weighting strategies in two other real-world
tasks: predicting stock market volatility and forecasting ride durations in NYC
taxi data.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-stage neural approach with Transformer-based architectures to simulate hair dynamics with high fidelity and generalization across hairstyles, body shapes, and motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in simulating hair dynamics that generalize across diverse hairstyles, body shapes, and motion while maintaining realism and avoiding penetrations.

Method: The method involves: (1) A Transformer-based static network to predict static draped hair shapes and resolve penetrations, and (2) A dynamic network with a cross-attention mechanism that incorporates hair features and motion data to generate dynamic behaviors efficiently.

Result: The proposed framework achieves real-time inference, high fidelity, and realistic dynamic motion for various hairstyles, including complex and unseen examples, while maintaining broad generalization.

Conclusion: This approach showcases the potential of Transformer architectures in resolving challenges in hair dynamics, offering a robust solution for generalization, realism, and efficiency in real-time simulations.

Abstract: Simulating hair dynamics that generalize across arbitrary hairstyles, body
shapes, and motions is a critical challenge. Our novel two-stage neural
solution is the first to leverage Transformer-based architectures for such a
broad generalization. We propose a Transformer-powered static network that
predicts static draped shapes for any hairstyle, effectively resolving
hair-body penetrations and preserving hair fidelity. Subsequently, a dynamic
network with a novel cross-attention mechanism fuses static hair features with
kinematic input to generate expressive dynamics and complex secondary motions.
This dynamic network also allows for efficient fine-tuning of challenging
motion sequences, such as abrupt head movements. Our method offers real-time
inference for both static single-frame drapes and dynamic drapes over pose
sequences. Our method demonstrates high-fidelity and generalizable dynamic hair
across various styles, guided by physics-informed losses, and can resolve
penetrations even for complex, unseen long hairstyles, highlighting its broad
generalization.

### [281] [Coarse Addition and the St. Petersburg Paradox: A Heuristic Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12475)
*Takashi Izumo*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: This paper addresses the paradoxical decision theory problem of the St. Petersburg paradox through a novel approach using 'coarse partitions' in decision-making instead of traditional utility assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the St. Petersburg paradox, where infinite expected values fail to align with rational decision-making, and existing solutions often do not reflect real-world human numerical processing.

Method: The authors propose a 'coarse partition' approach where outcomes are grouped into perceptual categories, and addition operates on representative values of these groups, introducing a concept called inertial stabilization.

Result: The study demonstrates that using coarse addition, the infinite St. Petersburg series becomes inert for a well-constructed partition, resolving the paradox in this framework.

Conclusion: While not a definitive resolution of the paradox, this framework represents decision-making under cognitive limits and has potential applications for behavioral and machine reasoning models.

Abstract: The St. Petersburg paradox presents a longstanding challenge in decision
theory. It describes a game whose expected value is infinite, yet for which no
rational finite stake can be determined. Traditional solutions introduce
auxiliary assumptions, such as diminishing marginal utility, temporal
discounting, or extended number systems. These methods often involve
mathematical refinements that may not correspond to how people actually
perceive or process numerical information. This paper explores an alternative
approach based on a modified operation of addition defined over coarse
partitions of the outcome space. In this model, exact numerical values are
grouped into perceptual categories, and each value is replaced by a
representative element of its group before being added. This method allows for
a phenomenon where repeated additions eventually cease to affect the outcome, a
behavior described as inertial stabilization. Although this is not intended as
a definitive resolution of the paradox, the proposed framework offers a
plausible way to represent how agents with limited cognitive precision might
handle divergent reward structures. We demonstrate that the St. Petersburg
series can become inert under this coarse addition for a suitably constructed
partition. The approach may also have broader applications in behavioral
modeling and the study of machine reasoning under perceptual limitations.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study evaluates public perceptions and social impacts of fully autonomous cybernetic avatars (CAs) demonstrated at a large public event in Japan.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the feasibility and societal acceptance of fully autonomous cybernetic avatars as tools for physical support in daily life.

Method: A large-scale public demonstration and survey were conducted at a 19-day event in Osaka, Japan, involving visitors interacting with robotic avatars, semi-autonomous and fully autonomous.

Result: Survey revealed interest in adopting CAs for daily life and work but highlighted reliability of task execution as a top concern, while cost and human-like interaction were lesser concerns.

Conclusion: Public shows interest in fully autonomous CAs for physical support; however, technological reliability needs improvement to enhance societal acceptance.

Abstract: Cybernetic avatars (CAs) are key components of an avatar-symbiotic society,
enabling individuals to overcome physical limitations through virtual agents
and robotic assistants. While semi-autonomous CAs intermittently require human
teleoperation and supervision, the deployment of fully autonomous CAs remains a
challenge. This study evaluates public perception and potential social impacts
of fully autonomous CAs for physical support in daily life. To this end, we
conducted a large-scale demonstration and survey during Avatar Land, a 19-day
public event in Osaka, Japan, where fully autonomous robotic CAs, alongside
semi-autonomous CAs, performed daily object retrieval tasks. Specifically, we
analyzed responses from 2,285 visitors who engaged with various CAs, including
a subset of 333 participants who interacted with fully autonomous CAs and
shared their perceptions and concerns through a survey questionnaire. The
survey results indicate interest in CAs for physical support in daily life and
at work. However, concerns were raised regarding task execution reliability. In
contrast, cost and human-like interaction were not dominant concerns. Project

*Tianyu Song,Feng Li,Yuan Bi,Angelos Karlas,Amir Yousefi,Daniela Branzan,Zhongliang Jiang,Ulrich Eck,Nassir Navab*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a conversational virtual agent in XR for robotic ultrasound systems, enhancing interactions among physicians, robots, and patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the communication gap in robotic ultrasound systems by creating an intelligent virtual sonographer to improve interactions among physicians, robots, and patients.

Method: The study involves the development of an intelligent virtual sonographer (IVS) that integrates large language models, XR, speech-to-text, text-to-speech technology, and robotic control to facilitate professional physician communication and empathetic patient interaction.

Result: The system improves the efficiency, clarity, and accessibility of robotic ultrasound procedures, ensuring seamless communication among all parties involved.

Conclusion: This novel approach enhances physician control, builds trust in robotic systems, and improves patient experience, marking a significant step toward more effective human-robot-patient collaboration in healthcare.

Abstract: The advancement and maturity of large language models (LLMs) and robotics
have unlocked vast potential for human-computer interaction, particularly in
the field of robotic ultrasound. While existing research primarily focuses on
either patient-robot or physician-robot interaction, the role of an intelligent
virtual sonographer (IVS) bridging physician-robot-patient communication
remains underexplored. This work introduces a conversational virtual agent in
Extended Reality (XR) that facilitates real-time interaction between
physicians, a robotic ultrasound system(RUS), and patients. The IVS agent
communicates with physicians in a professional manner while offering empathetic
explanations and reassurance to patients. Furthermore, it actively controls the
RUS by executing physician commands and transparently relays these actions to
the patient. By integrating LLM-powered dialogue with speech-to-text,
text-to-speech, and robotic control, our system enhances the efficiency,
clarity, and accessibility of robotic ultrasound acquisition. This work
constitutes a first step toward understanding how IVS can bridge communication
gaps in physician-robot-patient interaction, providing more control and
therefore trust into physician-robot interaction while improving patient
experience and acceptance of robotic ultrasound.

### [284] [Autonomy for Older Adult-Agent Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12767)
*Jiaxin An*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores four dimensions of autonomy in AI agents for supporting older adults and proposes research directions for ethical and effective implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the aging population, AI agents are increasingly becoming vital in caregiving support, but aligning their autonomy with older adults' preferences is a key challenge.

Method: The study identifies and examines four dimensions of autonomy—decision-making, goal-oriented, control, and social responsibility—and proposes research avenues including social responsibility, task operationalization, and autonomy measurement.

Result: The paper outlines research directions to improve AI agent autonomy in caregiving contexts, focusing on ethical considerations, operational definitions, and measurement strategies.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to autonomy in AI caregiving systems for older adults, aiming for ethical and practical advancements.

Abstract: As the global population ages, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered agents
have emerged as potential tools to support older adults' caregiving. Prior
research has explored agent autonomy by identifying key interaction stages in
task processes and defining the agent's role at each stage. However, ensuring
that agents align with older adults' autonomy preferences remains a critical
challenge. Drawing on interdisciplinary conceptualizations of autonomy, this
paper examines four key dimensions of autonomy for older adults:
decision-making autonomy, goal-oriented autonomy, control autonomy, and social
responsibility autonomy. This paper then proposes the following research
directions: (1) Addressing social responsibility autonomy, which concerns the
ethical and social implications of agent use in communal settings; (2)
Operationalizing agent autonomy from the task perspective; and (3) Developing
autonomy measures.

### [285] [Safeguarding Federated Learning-based Road Condition Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12568)
*Sheng Liu,Panos Papadimitratos*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses vulnerabilities in Federated Learning for camera-based Road Condition Classification systems caused by Targeted Label Flipping Attacks (TLFAs), proposing a defense mechanism called FLARE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Federated Learning frameworks for autonomous driving are vulnerable to malicious attacks that compromise vehicle safety, and robust defenses against such attacks have not been thoroughly investigated.

Method: The work introduces a label-distance metric to assess safety risks from TLFAs and proposes FLARE—a defense mechanism employing output layer neuron-wise analysis to reduce attack impact.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate both the severity of TLFA vulnerabilities and the effectiveness of the FLARE mechanism across various classification tasks, metrics, baselines, and models.

Conclusion: FLARE provides a viable defense mechanism for mitigating TLFA impacts in Federated Learning systems for autonomous driving, enhancing model robustness and safety.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution for
privacy-preserving autonomous driving, specifically camera-based Road Condition
Classification (RCC) systems, harnessing distributed sensing, computing, and
communication resources on board vehicles without sharing sensitive image data.
However, the collaborative nature of FL-RCC frameworks introduces new
vulnerabilities: Targeted Label Flipping Attacks (TLFAs), in which malicious
clients (vehicles) deliberately alter their training data labels to compromise
the learned model inference performance. Such attacks can, e.g., cause a
vehicle to mis-classify slippery, dangerous road conditions as pristine and
exceed recommended speed. However, TLFAs for FL-based RCC systems are largely
missing. We address this challenge with a threefold contribution: 1) we
disclose the vulnerability of existing FL-RCC systems to TLFAs; 2) we introduce
a novel label-distance-based metric to precisely quantify the safety risks
posed by TLFAs; and 3) we propose FLARE, a defensive mechanism leveraging
neuron-wise analysis of the output layer to mitigate TLFA effects. Extensive
experiments across three RCC tasks, four evaluation metrics, six baselines, and
three deep learning models demonstrate both the severity of TLFAs on FL-RCC
systems and the effectiveness of FLARE in mitigating the attack impact.

*Jeremy McHugh,Kristina Šekrst,Jon Cefalu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper analyzes Prompt Injection 2.0, which combines prompt attacks with web vulnerabilities like XSS and CSRF, threatening AI-integrated systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address critical security threats posed by advanced prompt injection attacks in agentic AI systems that integrate traditional cybersecurity exploits.

Method: The study evaluates foundational and contemporary mitigation techniques, analyzes hybrid cyber-AI threats, and benchmarks traditional security measures against these attacks.

Result: Findings reveal that traditional security measures like web application firewalls, XSS filters, and CSRF tokens fail against modern AI-enhanced hybrid attacks.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the inadequacy of traditional controls and proposes architectural solutions involving prompt isolation, runtime security, privilege separation, and novel threat detection.

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks, where malicious input is designed to manipulate AI
systems into ignoring their original instructions and following unauthorized
commands instead, were first discovered by Preamble, Inc. in May 2022 and
responsibly disclosed to OpenAI. Over the last three years, these attacks have
continued to pose a critical security threat to LLM-integrated systems. The
emergence of agentic AI systems, where LLMs autonomously perform multistep
tasks through tools and coordination with other agents, has fundamentally
transformed the threat landscape. Modern prompt injection attacks can now
combine with traditional cybersecurity exploits to create hybrid threats that
systematically evade traditional security controls. This paper presents a
comprehensive analysis of Prompt Injection 2.0, examining how prompt injections
integrate with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),
and other web security vulnerabilities to bypass traditional security measures.
We build upon Preamble's foundational research and mitigation technologies,
evaluating them against contemporary threats, including AI worms, multi-agent
infections, and hybrid cyber-AI attacks. Our analysis incorporates recent
benchmarks that demonstrate how traditional web application firewalls, XSS
filters, and CSRF tokens fail against AI-enhanced attacks. We also present
architectural solutions that combine prompt isolation, runtime security, and
privilege separation with novel threat detection capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework using Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DistRL) for pricing path-dependent financial derivatives, emphasizing the estimation of the full distribution of payoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pricing methods focus on expected option value, limiting insights into risk and uncertainty. This paper aims to address this by modeling the entire conditional distribution of payoffs.

Method: The paper utilizes Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DistRL) and quantile-based value function approximators to model payoffs' full distribution, focusing on applications such as Asian options.

Result: The method showed effectiveness in pricing Asian options by offering a detailed distributional insight beyond traditional expected-value-focused approaches.

Conclusion: Modeling the full distribution of payoffs with DistRL enhances risk-aware pricing, tail-risk estimation, and uncertainty quantification for derivatives.

Abstract: We reinterpret and propose a framework for pricing path-dependent financial
derivatives by estimating the full distribution of payoffs using Distributional
Reinforcement Learning (DistRL). Unlike traditional methods that focus on
expected option value, our approach models the entire conditional distribution
of payoffs, allowing for risk-aware pricing, tail-risk estimation, and enhanced
uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method on Asian
options, using quantile-based value function approximators.

Main category: math.DG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning approach using a multivalued deep neural network in JAX to identify Z/2 eigenfunctions on the 2-sphere.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to utilize advanced machine learning techniques to discover Z/2 eigenfunctions, which can be positioned geometrically on the 2-sphere.

Method: The authors developed a multivalued feedforward deep neural network and used JAX library for implementation, testing three scenarios: fixed branch points at tetrahedron, cube, and movable branch points via AI optimization.

Result: Z/2 eigenfunctions were identified in all three scenarios, with AI optimizing the third case to form a squashed tetrahedron.

Conclusion: Machine learning, specifically a multivalued neural network, is shown to be effective in discovering mathematically significant eigenfunctions and exploring geometric configurations.

Abstract: We use machine learning to search for examples of Z/2 eigenfunctions on the
2-sphere. For this we created a multivalued version of a feedforward deep
neural network, and we implemented it using the JAX library. We found Z/2
eigenfunctions for three cases: In the first two cases we fixed the branch
points at the vertices of a tetrahedron and at a cube respectively. In a third
case, we allowed the AI to move the branch points around and, in the end, it
positioned the branch points at the vertices of a squashed tetrahedron.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient Audio Coding for Machines (ACoM) method compressing intermediate features of trained models, achieving ultra-low bitrates with minimal task performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently compressing audio data for machine-centric tasks, balancing ultra-low bitrates with downstream task performance.

Method: A novel ACoM strategy uses task-specific loss guidance and residual vector quantization (RVQ) to compress and quantize intermediate feature representations of trained models.

Result: The method achieves ultra-low bitrates (<200 bps) while maintaining downstream model performance, validated on ASR and audio classification tasks.

Conclusion: The work showcases the adaptability and efficacy of the proposed method, demonstrating its capability to handle various tasks and architectures with effective regularization.

Abstract: Neural audio codecs, leveraging quantization algorithms, have significantly
impacted various speech/audio tasks. While high-fidelity reconstruction is
paramount for human perception, audio coding for machines (ACoM) prioritizes
efficient compression and downstream task performance, disregarding perceptual
nuances. This work introduces an efficient ACoM method that can compress and
quantize any chosen intermediate feature representation of an already trained
speech/audio downstream model. Our approach employs task-specific loss guidance
alongside residual vector quantization (RVQ) losses, providing ultra-low
bitrates (i.e., less than 200 bps) with a minimal loss of the downstream model
performance. The resulting tokenizer is adaptable to various bitrates and model
sizes for flexible deployment. Evaluated on automatic speech recognition and
audio classification, our method demonstrates its efficacy and potential for
broader task and architectural applicability through appropriate
regularization.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper explores using neural networks to model nonlinear vibrations of drum-like elastic plates for real-time audio synthesis, comparing their performance and highlighting limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address the computational inefficiency of traditional numerical methods in modelling elastic plates for real-time audio synthesis.

Method: The study used state-of-the-art neural network models trained on short vibration sequences to predict longer ones in an autoregressive manner. Comparative analysis and time-domain error evaluation were conducted.

Result: The paper identifies limitations of current neural network approaches, such as inadequacy in prediction error analysis for time-domain accuracy.

Conclusion: While neural networks show promise, improvements are required for more effective real-time synthesis of nonlinear vibrations, and future works are proposed to address current gaps.

Abstract: Physical modelling synthesis aims to generate audio from physical simulations
of vibrating structures. Thin elastic plates are a common model for drum
membranes. Traditional numerical methods like finite differences and finite
elements offer high accuracy but are computationally demanding, limiting their
use in real-time audio applications. This paper presents a comparative analysis
of neural network-based approaches for solving the vibration of nonlinear
elastic plates. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models, trained on short
sequences, for prediction of long sequences in an autoregressive fashion. We
show some of the limitations of these models, and why is not enough to look at
the prediction error in the time domain. We discuss the implications for
real-time audio synthesis and propose future directions for improving neural
approaches to model nonlinear vibration.

*Kutub Uddin,Awais Khan,Muhammad Umar Farooq,Khalid Malik*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces SHIELD, a novel method to defend against generative audio anti-forensic attacks (deepfake attacks).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake audio poses risks by spreading misinformation and existing detection methods are vulnerable to anti-forensic attacks.

Method: SHIELD combines a defense generative model with a triplet correlation model to enhance detection of attacked audios.

Result: SHIELD defends against AF attacks, achieving average detection accuracies of over 98% across three datasets.

Conclusion: SHIELD outperforms existing methods in robustness and accuracy, safeguarding against generative AF attacks in various scenarios.

Abstract: Audio plays a crucial role in applications like speaker verification,
voice-enabled smart devices, and audio conferencing. However, audio
manipulations, such as deepfakes, pose significant risks by enabling the spread
of misinformation. Our empirical analysis reveals that existing methods for
detecting deepfake audio are often vulnerable to anti-forensic (AF) attacks,
particularly those attacked using generative adversarial networks. In this
article, we propose a novel collaborative learning method called SHIELD to
defend against generative AF attacks. To expose AF signatures, we integrate an
auxiliary generative model, called the defense (DF) generative model, which
facilitates collaborative learning by combining input and output. Furthermore,
we design a triplet model to capture correlations for real and AF attacked
audios with real-generated and attacked-generated audios using auxiliary
generative models. The proposed SHIELD strengthens the defense against
generative AF attacks and achieves robust performance across various generative
models. The proposed AF significantly reduces the average detection accuracy
from 95.49% to 59.77% for ASVspoof2019, from 99.44% to 38.45% for In-the-Wild,
and from 98.41% to 51.18% for HalfTruth for three different generative models.
The proposed SHIELD mechanism is robust against AF attacks and achieves an
average accuracy of 98.13%, 98.58%, and 99.57% in match, and 98.78%, 98.62%,
and 98.85% in mismatch settings for the ASVspoof2019, In-the-Wild, and
HalfTruth datasets, respectively.

### [292] [Sample-Constrained Black Box Optimization for Audio Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12773)
*Rajalaxmi Rajagopalan,Yu-Lin Wei,Romit Roy Choudhury*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper addresses personalizing audio for optimal user experience through a hybrid black-box optimization approach that combines querying user feedback on both complete filters and individual components. They validate their approach using Sparse Gaussian Process Regression and real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance user satisfaction in audio experiences by developing an effective method to determine the optimal audio filter.

Method: A hybrid approach combining two types of queries: one for scoring filters and another for scoring individual filter components. They utilize Sparse Gaussian Process Regression to refine results.

Result: Their hybrid approach outperformed single query types, demonstrated through simulations and experiments where users provided feedback on music and speech audio.

Conclusion: The hybrid querying method shows superiority in optimizing user satisfaction in audio personalization and has potential applications beyond audio, offering a new avenue in black-box optimization.

Abstract: We consider the problem of personalizing audio to maximize user experience.
Briefly, we aim to find a filter $h^*$, which applied to any music or speech,
will maximize the user's satisfaction. This is a black-box optimization problem
since the user's satisfaction function is unknown. Substantive work has been
done on this topic where the key idea is to play audio samples to the user,
each shaped by a different filter $h_i$, and query the user for their
satisfaction scores $f(h_i)$. A family of ``surrogate" functions is then
designed to fit these scores and the optimization method gradually refines
these functions to arrive at the filter $\hat{h}^*$ that maximizes
satisfaction. In certain applications, we observe that a second type of
querying is possible where users can tell us the individual elements $h^*[j]$
of the optimal filter $h^*$. Consider an analogy from cooking where the goal is
to cook a recipe that maximizes user satisfaction. A user can be asked to score
various cooked recipes (e.g., tofu fried rice) or to score individual
ingredients (say, salt, sugar, rice, chicken, etc.). Given a budget of $B$
queries, where a query can be of either type, our goal is to find the recipe
that will maximize this user's satisfaction. Our proposal builds on Sparse
Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and shows how a hybrid approach can
outperform any one type of querying. Our results are validated through
simulations and real world experiments, where volunteers gave feedback on
music/speech audio and were able to achieve high satisfaction levels. We
believe this idea of hybrid querying opens new problems in black-box
optimization and solutions can benefit other applications beyond audio
personalization.

### [293] [Autoregressive Speech Enhancement via Acoustic Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12825)
*Luca Della Libera,Cem Subakan,Mirco Ravanelli*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores speech enhancement using discrete representations and proposes an autoregressive transducer-based model, showing acoustic tokens preserve speaker identity better than semantic tokens but still lag behind continuous representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing speech quality and intelligibility in real-world recordings remains a challenge, especially in integrating speech with other modalities using discrete representations.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of acoustic tokens, introducing an autoregressive transducer-based architecture, and experimentation on VoiceBank and Libri1Mix datasets.

Result: Acoustic tokens outperform semantic tokens in preserving speaker identity, and the autoregressive model enhances performance. However, discrete representations are still inferior to continuous ones.

Conclusion: Acoustic tokens and autoregressive modeling are promising for speech enhancement, but further research is necessary to bridge the performance gap with continuous representations.

Abstract: In speech processing pipelines, improving the quality and intelligibility of
real-world recordings is crucial. While supervised regression is the primary
method for speech enhancement, audio tokenization is emerging as a promising
alternative for a smooth integration with other modalities. However, research
on speech enhancement using discrete representations is still limited. Previous
work has mainly focused on semantic tokens, which tend to discard key acoustic
details such as speaker identity. Additionally, these studies typically employ
non-autoregressive models, assuming conditional independence of outputs and
overlooking the potential improvements offered by autoregressive modeling. To
address these gaps we: 1) conduct a comprehensive study of the performance of
acoustic tokens for speech enhancement, including the effect of bitrate and
noise strength; 2) introduce a novel transducer-based autoregressive
architecture specifically designed for this task. Experiments on VoiceBank and
Libri1Mix datasets show that acoustic tokens outperform semantic tokens in
terms of preserving speaker identity, and that our autoregressive approach can
further improve performance. Nevertheless, we observe that discrete
representations still fall short compared to continuous ones, highlighting the
need for further research in this area.

### [295] [CubeSat Orbit Insertion Maneuvering Using J2 Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13017)
*M. Amin Alandihallaj,M. Reza Emami*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a CubeSat maneuvering strategy using Earth's J2 perturbation to optimize orbital insertion and reduce fuel consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CubeSats face challenges in precise orbital insertion due to limited propulsion and fuel reserves.

Method: The authors proposed utilizing the J2 perturbation from Earth's oblateness to passively manage key orbital parameters, reducing reliance on propulsion corrections.

Result: Numerical simulations and case studies validated significant fuel savings and the method's effectiveness in improving orbital insertion accuracy.

Conclusion: The J2-augmented strategy can extend CubeSat operational life and is a promising solution for fuel-constrained low-Earth orbit missions.

Abstract: The precise insertion of CubeSats into designated orbits is a complex task,
primarily due to the limited propulsion capabilities and constrained fuel
reserves onboard, which severely restrict the scope for large orbital
corrections. This limitation necessitates the development of more efficient
maneuvering techniques to ensure mission success. In this paper, we propose a
maneuvering sequence that exploits the natural J2 perturbation caused by the
Earth's oblateness. By utilizing the secular effects of this perturbation, it
is possible to passively influence key orbital parameters such as the argument
of perigee and the right ascension of the ascending node, thereby reducing the
need for extensive propulsion-based corrections. The approach is designed to
optimize the CubeSat's orbital insertion and minimize the total fuel required
for trajectory adjustments, making it particularly suitable for
fuel-constrained missions. The proposed methodology is validated through
comprehensive numerical simulations that examine different initial orbital
conditions and perturbation environments. Case studies are presented to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the J2-augmented strategy in achieving
accurate orbital insertion, showing a major reduction in fuel consumption
compared to traditional methods. The results underscore the potential of this
approach to extend the operational life and capabilities of CubeSats, offering
a viable solution for future low-Earth orbit missions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Bayesian Optimization method to improve the accuracy of CGMD simulations by refining Martini3 topologies for domain-specific applications, achieving a balance between AA precision and CG efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy in CGMD simulations, particularly in domain-specific applications where accuracy and efficiency are critical.

Method: The study optimizes bonded interaction parameters in Martini3 CGMD topologies using Bayesian Optimization methodologies, ensuring applicability across different polymerizations.

Result: The optimized CG potential demonstrates accuracy approaching AAMD while retaining CGMD's computational speed, representing significant progress in multiscale molecular simulations.

Conclusion: This method bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in molecular simulations, enabling faster and more cost-effective molecular discoveries in various scientific and technological fields.

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for accurately predicting
the physical and chemical properties of large molecular systems across various
pressure and temperature ensembles. However, the high computational costs
associated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of
Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional
compression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced
computational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD
methods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to
generate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a
range of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization
with applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to
domain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed
are critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results
from CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies
specifically the bonded interaction parameters within a given coarse-grained
mapping - for domain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization
methodologies. We have developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any
degree of polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field.
Our optimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve
accuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of
CGMD. This approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in
multiscale molecular simulations, potentially enabling more rapid and
cost-effective molecular discovery across various scientific and technological
domains.

*Gabriel Istrate,Cosmin Bonchis,Victor Bogdan*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to study competitive algorithms with predictions in multiagent settings, demonstrating its application through a modified ski-rental problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the competitive efficiency of algorithms using predictors for self and other players' behaviors in multiagent scenarios.

Method: A two-predictor framework is proposed and applied to a multiagent ski-rental problem, analyzing algorithm performance under varying predictor accuracy.

Result: The study finds the optimal algorithm for perfect predictions but identifies robustness issues when predictions are inaccurate, subsequently designing a more robust algorithm with benchmarks.

Conclusion: Using two predictors can optimize algorithms in multiagent settings, but careful attention is needed to ensure robustness against predictor inaccuracies.

Abstract: We study the power of (competitive) algorithms with predictions in a
multiagent setting. We introduce a two predictor framework, that assumes that
agents use one predictor for their future (self) behavior, and one for the
behavior of the other players. The main problem we are concerned with is
understanding what are the best competitive ratios that can be achieved by
employing such predictors, under various assumptions on predictor quality.
  As an illustration of our framework, we introduce and analyze a multiagent
version of the ski-rental problem. In this problem agents can collaborate by
pooling resources to get a group license for some asset. If the license price
is not met then agents have to rent the asset individually for the day at a
unit price. Otherwise the license becomes available forever to everyone at no
extra cost.
  In the particular case of perfect other predictions the algorithm that
follows the self predictor is optimal but not robust to mispredictions of
agent's future behavior; we give an algorithm with better robustness properties
and benchmark it.

*Jinqiu Jin,Yang Zhang,Junwei Pan,Fuli Feng,Hua Lu,Haijie Gu,Xiangnan He*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces GMC, a generative approach for multi-target cross-domain recommendation, using semantically quantified item identifiers within a unified generative model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MTCDR approaches rely heavily on shared users/items or auxiliary data, which limits their application in non-overlapped scenarios. The need for more effective solutions motivates this study.

Method: The GMC method employs item tokenizers to generate semantic item identifiers and formulates recommendations as a next-token generation task, integrating a domain-aware contrastive loss and domain-specific fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments on five public datasets show that GMC outperforms existing MTCDR baseline methods.

Conclusion: GMC effectively utilizes generative paradigms for multi-target cross-domain recommendations, addressing challenges posed by non-overlapped data scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in Multi-Target Cross-Domain
Recommendation (MTCDR), which aims to enhance recommendation performance across
multiple domains simultaneously. Existing MTCDR methods primarily rely on
domain-shared entities (\eg users or items) to fuse and transfer cross-domain
knowledge, which may be unavailable in non-overlapped recommendation scenarios.
Some studies model user preferences and item features as domain-sharable
semantic representations, which can be utilized to tackle the MTCDR task.
Nevertheless, they often require extensive auxiliary data for pre-training.
Developing more effective solutions for MTCDR remains an important area for
further exploration.
  Inspired by recent advancements in generative recommendation, this paper
introduces GMC, a generative paradigm-based approach for multi-target
cross-domain recommendation. The core idea of GMC is to leverage semantically
quantized discrete item identifiers as a medium for integrating multi-domain
knowledge within a unified generative model. GMC first employs an item
tokenizer to generate domain-shared semantic identifiers for each item, and
then formulates item recommendation as a next-token generation task by training
a domain-unified sequence-to-sequence model. To further leverage the domain
information to enhance performance, we incorporate a domain-aware contrastive
loss into the semantic identifier learning, and perform domain-specific
fine-tuning on the unified recommender. Extensive experiments on five public
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GMC compared to a range of baseline
methods.

TL;DR: The paper presents a tool named VaxPulse Query Corner to address vaccine hesitancy by leveraging social media analysis using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vaccine hesitancy poses a public health risk, and current social media data analysis tools and approaches (like LLMs or topic modelling) face challenges such as lack of contextual awareness, missing current trends, or hallucinations.

Method: The authors developed the VaxPulse Query Corner using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach, focusing on providing faithful and relevant answers to complex queries about vaccine concerns on social media platforms.

Result: The tool has been tested on 35,103 Shingrix-related social media posts, achieving high scores for answer faithfulness (0.96) and relevance (0.94).

Conclusion: The VaxPulse Query Corner demonstrates the potential for improved understanding and responses to vaccine-related concerns by public health stakeholders, thereby aiding in mitigating vaccine hesitancy.

Abstract: Vaccine hesitancy threatens public health, leading to delayed or rejected
vaccines. Social media is a vital source for understanding public concerns, and
traditional methods like topic modelling often struggle to capture nuanced
opinions. Though trained for query answering, large Language Models (LLMs)
often miss current events and community concerns. Additionally, hallucinations
in LLMs can compromise public health communication. To address these
limitations, we developed a tool (VaxPulse Query Corner) using the Retrieval
Augmented Generation technique. It addresses complex queries about public
vaccine concerns on various online platforms, aiding public health
administrators and stakeholders in understanding public concerns and
implementing targeted interventions to boost vaccine confidence. Analysing
35,103 Shingrix social media posts, it achieved answer faithfulness (0.96) and
relevance (0.94).

### [300] [Achieving Robust Channel Estimation Neural Networks by Designed Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12630)
*Dianxin Luan,John Thompson*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper introduces a methodology for designing offline-trained neural networks that generalize well to unseen wireless channels without requiring prior channel information or parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of data-driven methods that struggle to generalize to unseen channel conditions, coupled with constraints of online training due to low latency and limited computational resources in wireless communication systems.

Method: The authors design synthetic training datasets and propose design criteria that guarantee neural networks achieve specified mean squared error (MSE) levels on new and unseen channels after training.

Result: By applying the proposed design, neural networks demonstrated robust generalization to various wireless channel conditions, including both fixed profiles and variable delay spreads, irrespective of the neural network architecture.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient implementation of neural networks for cognitive communication systems without requiring prior channel knowledge or real-time parameter tuning.

Abstract: Channel estimation is crucial in cognitive communications, as it enables
intelligent spectrum sensing and adaptive transmission by providing accurate
information about the current channel state. However, in many papers neural
networks are frequently tested by training and testing on one example channel
or similar channels. This is because data-driven methods often degrade on new
data which they are not trained on, as they cannot extrapolate their training
knowledge. This is despite the fact physical channels are often assumed to be
time-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and limited
computing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and computing
resources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters. This
motivates us to design offline-trained neural networks that can perform
robustly over wireless channels, but without any actual channel information
being known at design time. In this paper, we propose design criteria to
generate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that
after training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error
(MSE) on new and previously unseen channels. Therefore, neural network
solutions require no prior channel information or parameters update for
real-world implementations. Based on the proposed design criteria, we further
propose a benchmark design which ensures intelligent operation for different
channel profiles. To demonstrate general applicability, we use neural networks
with different levels of complexity to show that the generalization achieved
appears to be independent of neural network architecture. From simulations,
neural networks achieve robust generalization to wireless channels with both
fixed channel profiles and variable delay spreads.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified deep learning framework combining ResNet-based CNN, attention mechanism, and novel data augmentation for robust analysis of diverse physiological signals, achieving near-perfect accuracies on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a critical demand for unified architectures capable of analyzing diverse biological signals effectively, especially considered the challenges of class imbalance and biased performance in biomedical datasets.

Method: The study integrates ResNet-based CNN with attention mechanisms, applies advanced data augmentation strategies, employs preprocessing techniques, and tackles class imbalance using Focal Loss, with evaluations conducted on benchmark datasets.

Result: The proposed architecture achieves accuracies of 99.96%, 99.78%, and 100% on UCI Seizure EEG, MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, and PTB Diagnostic ECG datasets, demonstrating robustness and outperformance compared to existing standards.

Conclusion: The framework offers a high-performance solution for diverse physiological signal analysis, is memory-efficient (~130 MB), fast (~10 ms/sample), and suitable for deployment on wearable and low-end devices.

Abstract: The increasing need for accurate and unified analysis of diverse biological
signals, such as ECG and EEG, is paramount for comprehensive patient
assessment, especially in synchronous monitoring. Despite advances in
multi-sensor fusion, a critical gap remains in developing unified architectures
that effectively process and extract features from fundamentally different
physiological signals. Another challenge is the inherent class imbalance in
many biomedical datasets, often causing biased performance in traditional
methods. This study addresses these issues by proposing a novel and unified
deep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across
different signal types. Our method integrates a ResNet-based CNN with an
attention mechanism, enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy:
time-domain concatenation of multiple augmented variants of each signal to
generate richer representations. Unlike prior work, we scientifically increase
signal complexity to achieve future-reaching capabilities, which resulted in
the best predictions compared to the state of the art. Preprocessing steps
included wavelet denoising, baseline removal, and standardization. Class
imbalance was effectively managed through the combined use of this advanced
data augmentation and the Focal Loss function. Regularization techniques were
applied during training to ensure generalization. We rigorously evaluated the
proposed architecture on three benchmark datasets: UCI Seizure EEG, MIT-BIH
Arrhythmia, and PTB Diagnostic ECG. It achieved accuracies of 99.96%, 99.78%,
and 100%, respectively, demonstrating robustness across diverse signal types
and clinical contexts. Finally, the architecture requires ~130 MB of memory and
processes each sample in ~10 ms, suggesting suitability for deployment on
low-end or wearable devices.

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: This paper explores the computational complexity of diffusion-based language models, proposing a dichotomy regarding their performance based on the score-matching network quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical limits and computational potential of diffusion models for language tasks, especially concerning sequential computation.

Method: The authors analyze the complexity of diffusion models by proving theoretical bounds and studying their simulation capabilities compared to Turing machines.

Result: They establish a dichotomy: exact score-matching networks perform within $\mathsf{TC}^0$ complexity, while unconstrained networks can simulate any Turing machine.

Conclusion: Diffusion models have both limitations and potential based on their design, and hybrid architectures combining sequential and parallel elements may surpass current models like Transformers.

Abstract: This paper explores the computational complexity of diffusion-based language
modeling. We prove a dichotomy based on the quality of the score-matching
network in a diffusion model. In one direction, a network that exactly computes
the score function of some initial distribution can only perform language
modeling within the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ complexity class, reflecting limitations
tied to rapid convergence. In the other direction, we show that if there is no
requirement for the network to match any score function, then diffusion
modeling can simulate any Turing machine in a certain sense. This dichotomy
provides a theoretical lens on the capabilities and limitations of diffusion
models, particularly concerning tasks requiring sequential computation. We
conjecture extensions of our theoretical results, including for the case where
the diffusion model is not perfect, but merely good. We also discuss the wider
context and practical implications, and hypothesize that a machine learning
architecture that can interpolate between sequential and parallel modes of
operation would be superior to both Transformers and diffusion models.

*Guy Blanc,Caleb Koch,Carmen Strassle,Li-Yang Tan*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: The paper discusses computational-statistical tradeoffs in PAC learning, offering results based on NP-hardness. It identifies specific tradeoffs, characterizes RP vs NP through learning, and presents the first NP-hardness results for improperly learning a circuit subclass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether computational tradeoffs, particularly in PAC learning, can be based on standard worst-case assumptions rather than average-case ones, and whether efficient algorithms can match information-theoretic limits.

Method: The authors base computational-statistical tradeoffs on NP-hardness assumptions. They investigate sample complexity for efficient learning, characterize the equivalence of RP and NP using learning classes, and develop improper learning frameworks to address formal barriers.

Result: They present sharp tradeoffs in sample complexity assuming NP requires exponential time and characterize RP = NP using learnable classes. They also establish NP-hardness for improper learning of polynomial-size circuits.

Conclusion: The findings present new insights into computational-statistical tradeoffs, bridging worst-case assumptions with average-case statistical problems and advancing improper learning frameworks for NP-hard classes.

Abstract: A central question in computer science and statistics is whether efficient
algorithms can achieve the information-theoretic limits of statistical
problems. Many computational-statistical tradeoffs have been shown under
average-case assumptions, but since statistical problems are average-case in
nature, it has been a challenge to base them on standard worst-case
assumptions.
  In PAC learning where such tradeoffs were first studied, the question is
whether computational efficiency can come at the cost of using more samples
than information-theoretically necessary. We base such tradeoffs on
$\mathsf{NP}$-hardness and obtain:
  $\circ$ Sharp computational-statistical tradeoffs assuming $\mathsf{NP}$
requires exponential time: For every polynomial $p(n)$, there is an $n$-variate
class $C$ with VC dimension $1$ such that the sample complexity of
time-efficiently learning $C$ is $\Theta(p(n))$.
  $\circ$ A characterization of $\mathsf{RP}$ vs. $\mathsf{NP}$ in terms of
learning: $\mathsf{RP} = \mathsf{NP}$ iff every $\mathsf{NP}$-enumerable class
is learnable with $O(\mathrm{VCdim}(C))$ samples in polynomial time. The
forward implication has been known since (Pitt and Valiant, 1988); we prove the
reverse implication.
  Notably, all our lower bounds hold against improper learners. These are the
first $\mathsf{NP}$-hardness results for improperly learning a subclass of
polynomial-size circuits, circumventing formal barriers of Applebaum, Barak,
and Xiao (2008).

*Tianxi Zhu,Yi Xu,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper investigates stochastic first-order methods (SFOMs) under heavy-tailed gradient noises for weakly convex objectives, focusing on sub-Weibull noise and $p$-BCM noise. It analyzes convergence in high-probability and in-expectation cases for such optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training deep learning models often involves heavy-tailed gradient noises, which pose significant challenges for optimization. The study aims to enhance understanding of convergence properties of SFOMs under these noisy scenarios, particularly for weakly convex optimization problems.

Method: The authors investigated high-probability convergence of vanilla stochastic subgradient descent (SsGD) under sub-Weibull noise. Additionally, they explored both high-probability and in-expectation convergence of clipped SsGD under $p$-BCM noises, analyzing these methods for weakly convex optimization.

Result: For sub-Weibull noise, vanilla SsGD maintained comparable theoretical performance to smooth objectives. For $p$-BCM noise, clipped SGD showed no degradation in convergence dependence on failure probability, but its sample complexity was worse compared to smooth optimization.

Conclusion: The paper expands understanding of SFOMs under heavy-tailed gradient noises, highlighting key performance trade-offs and theoretical implications for optimizing weakly convex objectives.

Abstract: An increasing number of studies have focused on stochastic first-order
methods (SFOMs) under heavy-tailed gradient noises, which have been observed in
the training of practical deep learning models. In this paper, we focus on two
types of gradient noises: one is sub-Weibull noise, and the other is noise
under the assumption that it has a bounded $p$-th central moment ($p$-BCM) with
$p\in (1, 2]$. The latter is more challenging due to the occurrence of infinite
variance when $p\in (1, 2)$. Under these two gradient noise assumptions, the
in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs have been extensively
studied in the contexts of convex optimization and standard smooth
optimization. However, for weakly convex objectives-a class that includes all
Lipschitz-continuous convex objectives and smooth objectives-our understanding
of the in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs under these two
types of noises remains incomplete. We investigate the high-probability
convergence of the vanilla stochastic subgradient descent (SsGD) method under
sub-Weibull noises, as well as the high-probability and in-expectation
convergence of clipped SsGD under the $p$-BCM noises. Both analyses are
conducted in the context of weakly convex optimization. For weakly convex
objectives that may be non-convex and non-smooth, our results demonstrate that
the theoretical dependence of vanilla SsGD on the failure probability and
number of iterations under sub-Weibull noises does not degrade compared to the
case of smooth objectives. Under $p$-BCM noises, our findings indicate that the
non-smoothness and non-convexity of weakly convex objectives do not impact the
theoretical dependence of clipped SGD on the failure probability relative to
the smooth case; however, the sample complexity we derived is worse than a
well-known lower bound for smooth optimization.

we investigate positive semidefiniteness and semidefinite programming under the

choice of matrix M in the $\star_M$-product and the representation theory of an
underlying group action. Using this framework, third order tensors equipped
with the $\star_M$-product are a natural setting for the study of invariant
semidefinite programs. As applications of the M-SDP framework, we provide a
characterization of certain nonnegative quadratic forms and solve low-rank

TL;DR: This paper addresses unsupervised metric learning by proposing algorithms for optimizing OT costs and exploring alternate distance measures, such as Mahalanobis and graph Laplacians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve data classification without relying on labeled samples, with a focus on learning optimal distance measures for unsupervised tasks.

Method: The study investigates algorithmic solutions like stochastic random function iteration for OT cost matrices and explores alternative metrics such as Mahalanobis-like distances and graph Laplacians.

Result: The stochastic random function iteration algorithm is shown to converge linearly, and the use of graph Laplacians leads to simpler, linear algorithms.

Conclusion: The work advances unsupervised metric learning by ensuring convergence in OT settings and broadening the scope to computationally simpler alternative metrics like graph Laplacians.

Abstract: Data classification without access to labeled samples remains a challenging
problem. It usually depends on an appropriately chosen distance between
features, a topic addressed in metric learning. Recently, Huizing, Cantini and
Peyr\'e proposed to simultaneously learn optimal transport (OT) cost matrices
between samples and features of the dataset. This leads to the task of finding
positive eigenvectors of a certain nonlinear function that maps cost matrices
to OT distances. Having this basic idea in mind, we consider both the
algorithmic and the modeling part of unsupervised metric learning. First, we
examine appropriate algorithms and their convergence. In particular, we propose
to use the stochastic random function iteration algorithm and prove that it
converges linearly for our setting, although our operators are not
paracontractive as it was required for convergence so far. Second, we ask the
natural question if the OT distance can be replaced by other distances. We show
how Mahalanobis-like distances fit into our considerations. Further, we examine
an approach via graph Laplacians. In contrast to the previous settings, we have
just to deal with linear functions in the wanted matrices here, so that simple
algorithms from linear algebra can be applied.

Our disease diagnosis model incorporates three key innovations: (a) Multimodal
fusion technique (MetaFusion) combining clinical metadata and images; (b)
Pretraining method leveraging supervised and self-supervised loss functions;
and (c) Multitask model to simultaneously predict 5 diseases. We make use of
BRSET (lab-captured images) and mBRSET (smartphone-captured images) datasets,
both of which also contain clinical metadata for model training/evaluation.
  Results: Trained on a dataset of BRSET and mBRSET images, the image quality
checker achieves near-100% accuracy in filtering out low-quality fundus images.
The multimodal pretrained disease diagnosis model outperforms models using only
images by 6% in balanced accuracy for BRSET and 4% for mBRSET.
  Conclusions: The InSight pipeline demonstrates robustness across varied image

*Qiankai Wang,James E. D. Tweel,Parsin Haji Reza,Anita Layton*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: PaPIS is a novel metric for evaluating virtual staining that outperforms traditional methods by focusing on pathology-relevant features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of existing full-reference image quality assessment metrics for virtual staining, which often fail to accurately reflect pathology-relevant features.

Method: The researchers developed PaPIS, a new metric leveraging deep learning features trained on cell morphology segmentation and using Retinex-inspired feature decomposition.

Result: PaPIS showed better alignment with pathology-relevant visual cues, achieved improved detection of subtle cellular structures, and enhanced histological fidelity when used as a loss function in models.

Conclusion: PaPIS offers a pathology-aware evaluation framework that advances virtual staining technologies and their readiness for clinical applications.

Abstract: Virtual staining has emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional
histopathological staining techniques, enabling rapid, reagent-free image
transformations. However, existing evaluation methods predominantly rely on
full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) metrics such as structural
similarity, which are originally designed for natural images and often fail to
capture pathology-relevant features. Expert pathology reviews have also been
used, but they are inherently subjective and time-consuming.
  In this study, we introduce PaPIS (Pathology-Aware Perceptual Image
Similarity), a novel FR-IQA metric specifically tailored for virtual staining
evaluation. PaPIS leverages deep learning-based features trained on cell
morphology segmentation and incorporates Retinex-inspired feature decomposition
to better reflect histological perceptual quality. Comparative experiments
demonstrate that PaPIS more accurately aligns with pathology-relevant visual
cues and distinguishes subtle cellular structures that traditional and existing
perceptual metrics tend to overlook. Furthermore, integrating PaPIS as a
guiding loss function in a virtual staining model leads to improved
histological fidelity.
  This work highlights the critical need for pathology-aware evaluation

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel NR-IQA method using a content-focused dataset and contrastive learning to improve perceptual image quality prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in NR-IQA due to sparse labeled datasets and improve alignment with human image quality judgments.

Method: The authors introduce a custom dataset of reference images, combined with a no-reference IQA model leveraging contrastive triplet-based learning.

Result: Their approach efficiently trains models using fewer samples and achieves strong generalization across existing datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enhances NR-IQA performance, providing a scalable solution backed by strong results and open access tools.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models aim to predict perceptual image quality
in alignment with human judgments. No-Reference (NR) IQA remains particularly
challenging due to the absence of a reference image. While deep learning has
significantly advanced this field, a major hurdle in developing NR-IQA models
is the limited availability of subjectively labeled data. Most existing deep
learning-based NR-IQA approaches rely on pre-training on large-scale datasets
before fine-tuning for IQA tasks. To further advance progress in this area, we
propose a novel approach that constructs a custom dataset using a limited
number of reference content images and introduces a no-reference IQA model that
incorporates both content and quality features for perceptual quality
prediction. Specifically, we train a quality-aware model using contrastive
triplet-based learning, enabling efficient training with fewer samples while
achieving strong generalization performance across publicly available datasets.

Conclusion: Pixel Perfect MegaMed bridges the gap between textual descriptions and medical image generation, providing both high-resolution images and utility in data augmentation for low-data regimes.

Abstract: Medical image synthesis presents unique challenges due to the inherent
complexity and high-resolution details required in clinical contexts.
Traditional generative architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) or Variational Auto Encoder (VAEs) have shown great promise for
high-resolution image generation but struggle with preserving fine-grained
details that are key for accurate diagnosis. To address this issue, we
introduce Pixel Perfect MegaMed, the first vision-language foundation model to
synthesize images at resolutions of 1024x1024. Our method deploys a multi-scale
transformer architecture designed specifically for ultra-high resolution
medical image generation, enabling the preservation of both global anatomical
context and local image-level details. By leveraging vision-language alignment
techniques tailored to medical terminology and imaging modalities, Pixel
Perfect MegaMed bridges the gap between textual descriptions and visual
representations at unprecedented resolution levels. We apply our model to the
CheXpert dataset and demonstrate its ability to generate clinically faithful
chest X-rays from text prompts. Beyond visual quality, these high-resolution
synthetic images prove valuable for downstream tasks such as classification,
showing measurable performance gains when used for data augmentation,
particularly in low-data regimes. Our code is accessible through the project

*Caixia Dong,Duwei Dai,Xinyi Han,Fan Liu,Xu Yang,Zongfang Li,Songhua Xu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for accurate coronary artery segmentation using vision foundation models and combines global structural features with local details for enhanced accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coronary artery segmentation is critical for CAD diagnosis but is hindered by challenges like small size, complex morphology, and low contrast.

Method: The framework uses parallel encoders: a vision transformer for global features and a CNN for local details, fused with a cross-branch variational module and refined using evidential-learning uncertainty techniques.

Result: Extensive evaluations show superior segmentation performance and generalization across datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly improves coronary artery segmentation accuracy, has broad applicability, and the code is made publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate coronary artery segmentation is critical for computeraided diagnosis
of coronary artery disease (CAD), yet it remains challenging due to the small
size, complex morphology, and low contrast with surrounding tissues. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel segmentation framework that leverages the
power of vision foundation models (VFMs) through a parallel encoding
architecture. Specifically, a vision transformer (ViT) encoder within the VFM
captures global structural features, enhanced by the activation of the final
two ViT blocks and the integration of an attention-guided enhancement (AGE)
module, while a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder extracts local
details. These complementary features are adaptively fused using a cross-branch
variational fusion (CVF) module, which models latent distributions and applies
variational attention to assign modality-specific weights. Additionally, we
introduce an evidential-learning uncertainty refinement (EUR) module, which
quantifies uncertainty using evidence theory and refines uncertain regions by
incorporating multi-scale feature aggregation and attention mechanisms, further
enhancing segmentation accuracy. Extensive evaluations on one in-house and two
public datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in
accurate coronary artery segmentation and showcasing strong generalization
across multiple datasets. The code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method using a conditional Bernoulli diffusion model to improve orbital bone segmentation accuracy in facial CT images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges in segmenting orbital bones due to ambiguous boundaries and thin structures, particularly for customized implant creation.

Method: A framework leveraging consensus from multiple plausible segmentations generated by a conditional Bernoulli diffusion model, combined with a correction step based on position proximity, consensus level, and gradient direction similarity.

Result: The method outperformed existing techniques, notably improving recall in ambiguous regions and maintaining continuity of thin structures.

Conclusion: The proposed approach automates segmentation correction, enhances segmentation accuracy in challenging regions, and can aid in image-guided surgical applications.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of orbital bones in facial computed tomography (CT)
images is essential for the creation of customized implants for reconstruction
of defected orbital bones, particularly challenging due to the ambiguous
boundaries and thin structures such as the orbital medial wall and orbital
floor. In these ambiguous regions, existing segmentation approaches often
output disconnected or under-segmented results. We propose a novel framework
that corrects segmentation results by leveraging consensus from multiple
diffusion model outputs. Our approach employs a conditional Bernoulli diffusion
model trained on diverse annotation patterns per image to generate multiple
plausible segmentations, followed by a consensus-driven correction that
incorporates position proximity, consensus level, and gradient direction
similarity to correct challenging regions. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing methods, significantly improving recall in
ambiguous regions while preserving the continuity of thin structures.
Furthermore, our method automates the manual process of segmentation result
correction and can be applied to image-guided surgical planning and surgery.

*Alicia Durrer,Florentin Bieder,Paul Friedrich,Bjoern Menze,Philippe C. Cattin,Florian Kofler*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents fastWDM3D, a model for fast and high-quality 3D inpainting of healthy brain tissue, addressing the slow sampling speed issue of previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this research is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of healthy tissue inpainting, which is useful for tumor growth modeling and image registration, overcoming the slow sampling speed of existing methods.

Method: The authors adapted a 2D diffusion model integrating DDPMs and GANs with a variance-preserving noise schedule for 3D inpainting. They later refined the approach using a 3D wavelet-based diffusion model (WDM3D) without a GAN component.

Result: The proposed fastWDM3D model achieved an SSIM of 0.8571, MSE of 0.0079, and PSNR of 22.26 on the BraTS inpainting test set in just 1.81 seconds per image—a speed-up of up to 800x compared to prior DDPM-based models.

Conclusion: fastWDM3D significantly enhances healthy tissue inpainting by combining speed and accuracy, proving its potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Healthy tissue inpainting has significant applications, including the
generation of pseudo-healthy baselines for tumor growth models and the
facilitation of image registration. In previous editions of the BraTS Local
Synthesis of Healthy Brain Tissue via Inpainting Challenge, denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) demonstrated qualitatively convincing results but
suffered from low sampling speed. To mitigate this limitation, we adapted a 2D
image generation approach, combining DDPMs with generative adversarial networks
(GANs) and employing a variance-preserving noise schedule, for the task of 3D
inpainting. Our experiments showed that the variance-preserving noise schedule
and the selected reconstruction losses can be effectively utilized for
high-quality 3D inpainting in a few time steps without requiring adversarial
training. We applied our findings to a different architecture, a 3D wavelet
diffusion model (WDM3D) that does not include a GAN component. The resulting
model, denoted as fastWDM3D, obtained a SSIM of 0.8571, a MSE of 0.0079, and a
PSNR of 22.26 on the BraTS inpainting test set. Remarkably, it achieved these
scores using only two time steps, completing the 3D inpainting process in 1.81
s per image. When compared to other DDPMs used for healthy brain tissue
inpainting, our model is up to 800 x faster while still achieving superior
performance metrics. Our proposed method, fastWDM3D, represents a promising
approach for fast and accurate healthy tissue inpainting. Our code is available

### [315] [SpectraLift: Physics-Guided Spectral-Inversion Network for Self-Supervised Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13339)
*Ritik Shah,Marco F. Duarte*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpectraLift, a method to generate high-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (HR-HSI) by fusing low-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSI) with high-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSI) without requiring impractical data like ground truth HR-HSI or point spread function calibrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for fusing hyperspectral and multispectral images require impractical calibrations such as point spread function (PSF) data or ground truth high-resolution hyperspectral images, limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: SpectraLift is a self-supervised framework that uses the spectral response function (SRF) of HR-MSI to train a per-pixel multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network. The network is optimized using a synthetic low-resolution image derived from the SRF, and an L1 spectral reconstruction loss is applied.

Result: SpectraLift is computationally efficient, converging within minutes, and is robust against variations in spatial blur and resolution. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods in metrics such as PSNR, SAM, SSIM, and RMSE.

Conclusion: SpectraLift removes the dependency on impractical data for HSI-MSI fusion while providing superior performance and computational efficiency, making it viable for real-world applications like remote sensing and medical imaging.

Abstract: High-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (HSI) are essential for
applications such as remote sensing and medical imaging, yet HSI sensors
inherently trade spatial detail for spectral richness. Fusing
high-spatial-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSI) with
low-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSI) is a promising route to
recover fine spatial structures without sacrificing spectral fidelity. Most
state-of-the-art methods for HSI-MSI fusion demand point spread function (PSF)
calibration or ground truth high resolution HSI (HR-HSI), both of which are
impractical to obtain in real world settings. We present SpectraLift, a fully
self-supervised framework that fuses LR-HSI and HR-MSI inputs using only the
MSI's Spectral Response Function (SRF). SpectraLift trains a lightweight
per-pixel multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network using ($i$)~a synthetic
low-spatial-resolution multispectral image (LR-MSI) obtained by applying the
SRF to the LR-HSI as input, ($ii$)~the LR-HSI as the output, and ($iii$)~an
$\ell_1$ spectral reconstruction loss between the estimated and true LR-HSI as
the optimization objective. At inference, SpectraLift uses the trained network
to map the HR-MSI pixel-wise into a HR-HSI estimate. SpectraLift converges in
minutes, is agnostic to spatial blur and resolution, and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on PSNR, SAM, SSIM, and RMSE benchmarks.

Motivation: To address limitations of classical and deep learning methods in effectively handling high-dimensional biomedical data and large-scale datasets for dementia prediction.

Method: A quantum transfer learning (QTL) approach is used to enhance the performance of a weak classical deep learning model for binary classification of dementia, along with an analysis of noise effects to evaluate robustness.

Result: QTL effectively transformed a suboptimal classical model into a more efficient solution for biomedical image classification.

Conclusion: Quantum techniques have the potential to advance healthcare technology by overcoming computational and performance limitations in dementia detection.

Abstract: Dementia is a devastating condition with profound implications for
individuals, families, and healthcare systems. Early and accurate detection of
dementia is critical for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.
While classical machine learning and deep learning approaches have been
explored extensively for dementia prediction, these solutions often struggle
with high-dimensional biomedical data and large-scale datasets, quickly
reaching computational and performance limitations. To address this challenge,
quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising paradigm, offering
faster training and advanced pattern recognition capabilities. This work aims
to demonstrate the potential of quantum transfer learning (QTL) to enhance the
performance of a weak classical deep learning model applied to a binary
classification task for dementia detection. Besides, we show the effect of
noise on the QTL-based approach, investigating the reliability and robustness
of this method. Using the OASIS 2 dataset, we show how quantum techniques can
transform a suboptimal classical model into a more effective solution for
biomedical image classification, highlighting their potential impact on
advancing healthcare technology.

TL;DR: SpoQFL is a framework that improves Quantum Federated Learning by addressing quantum noise heterogeneity through sporadic learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum noise heterogeneity in modern quantum devices impairs the performance of Quantum Federated Learning due to differences in hardware quality and sensitivity.

Method: The proposed method, SpoQFL, employs sporadic learning techniques to dynamically adapt training strategies based on real-time noise fluctuations in quantum systems.

Result: SpoQFL demonstrates superior training performance, robustness, and convergence stability when compared to conventional QFL methods during experiments with real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SpoQFL effectively mitigates the challenges posed by quantum noise heterogeneity, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of Quantum Federated Learning.

Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging paradigm that combines
quantum computing and federated learning (FL) to enable decentralized model
training while maintaining data privacy over quantum networks. However, quantum
noise remains a significant barrier in QFL, since modern quantum devices
experience heterogeneous noise levels due to variances in hardware quality and
sensitivity to quantum decoherence, resulting in inadequate training
performance. To address this issue, we propose SpoQFL, a novel QFL framework
that leverages sporadic learning to mitigate quantum noise heterogeneity in
distributed quantum systems. SpoQFL dynamically adjusts training strategies
based on noise fluctuations, enhancing model robustness, convergence stability,
and overall learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that SpoQFL significantly outperforms conventional QFL approaches,
achieving superior training performance and more stable convergence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need to understand disease dynamics, transmission, and the effectiveness of interventions to improve future preparedness.

Method: The study involves analyzing a large-scale, two-year dataset from Cyprus, integrating epidemiological data, vaccination records, policy measures, and weather conditions to forecast COVID-19 trends.

Result: The paper provides insights into infection trends, assesses the performance of forecasting models, and examines the impact of external factors on disease dynamics.

Conclusion: The findings contribute valuable knowledge to improving forecasting models, aiding in better preparedness and responses to future outbreaks, and minimizing their societal and economic effects.

Abstract: Emerging in December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread health,
economic, and social disruptions. Rapid global transmission overwhelmed
healthcare systems, resulting in high infection rates, hospitalisations, and
fatalities. To minimise the spread, governments implemented several
non-pharmaceutical interventions like lockdowns and travel restrictions. While
effective in controlling transmission, these measures also posed significant
economic and societal challenges. Although the WHO declared COVID-19 no longer
a global health emergency in May 2023, its impact persists, shaping public
health strategies. The vast amount of data collected during the pandemic offers
valuable insights into disease dynamics, transmission, and intervention
effectiveness. Leveraging these insights can improve forecasting models,
enhancing preparedness and response to future outbreaks while mitigating their
social and economic impact. This paper presents a large-scale case study on
COVID-19 forecasting in Cyprus, utilising a two-year dataset that integrates
epidemiological data, vaccination records, policy measures, and weather
conditions. We analyse infection trends, assess forecasting performance, and
examine the influence of external factors on disease dynamics. The insights
gained contribute to improved pandemic preparedness and response strategies.

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: The paper introduces mNARX+, an automated method for modeling complex dynamical systems, improving upon traditional mNARX by reducing reliance on domain expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitation of traditional mNARX modeling, which heavily depends on domain expertise for identifying auxiliary quantities and their causal ordering.

Method: The proposed mNARX+ employs a data-driven, recursive algorithm that selects temporal features based on correlations with prediction residuals, automating model construction.

Result: mNARX+ was tested on two complex systems—a Bouc-Wen oscillator and a wind turbine simulator—and demonstrated accurate and stable surrogate models.

Conclusion: The mNARX+ algorithm provides a systematic, automated, data-driven solution for modeling complex dynamical systems, reducing the need for prior system knowledge.

Abstract: We propose an automatic approach for manifold nonlinear autoregressive with
exogenous inputs (mNARX) modeling that leverages the feature-based structure of
functional-NARX (F-NARX) modeling. This novel approach, termed mNARX+,
preserves the key strength of the mNARX framework, which is its expressivity
allowing it to model complex dynamical systems, while simultaneously addressing
a key limitation: the heavy reliance on domain expertise to identify relevant
auxiliary quantities and their causal ordering. Our method employs a
data-driven, recursive algorithm that automates the construction of the mNARX
model sequence. It operates by sequentially selecting temporal features based
on their correlation with the model prediction residuals, thereby automatically
identifying the most critical auxiliary quantities and the order in which they
should be modeled. This procedure significantly reduces the need for prior
system knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the mNARX+ algorithm on
two case studies: a Bouc-Wen oscillator with strong hysteresis and a complex
aero-servo-elastic wind turbine simulator. The results show that the algorithm
provides a systematic, data-driven method for creating accurate and stable
surrogate models for complex dynamical systems.

TL;DR: The study focuses on implementing Vecchia Approximation for Gaussian Processes on GPUs, presenting a novel method that achieves better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian Processes are computationally intensive for large datasets, and while Vecchia Approximation reduces complexity, GPU-accelerated implementations for it are lacking.

Method: Three GPU-based implementations of Vecchia Approximation were compared, with one novel method being optimized for memory performance. The best-performing method was integrated into the GpGpU R package.

Result: The new GPU-based method in GpGpU outperformed existing multi-core and GPU software in both runtime and predictive accuracy, demonstrated on datasets including one with over a million points.

Conclusion: The proposed GPU-optimized Vecchia Approximation offers a significant improvement for Gaussian Process model fitting, making it suitable for large-scale spatial-temporal datasets.

Abstract: Gaussian Processes have become an indispensable part of the spatial
statistician's toolbox but are unsuitable for analyzing large dataset because
of the significant time and memory needed to fit the associated model exactly.
Vecchia Approximation is widely used to reduce the computational complexity and
can be calculated with embarrassingly parallel algorithms. While multi-core
software has been developed for Vecchia Approximation, such as the GpGp R
package, software designed to run on graphics processing units (GPU) is
lacking, despite the tremendous success GPUs have had in statistics and machine
learning. We compare three different ways to implement Vecchia Approximation on
a GPU: two of which are similar to methods used for other Gaussian Process
approximations and one that is new. The impact of memory type on performance is
investigated and the final method is optimized accordingly. We show that our
new method outperforms the other two and then present it in the GpGpU R
package. We compare GpGpU to existing multi-core and GPU-accelerated software
by fitting Gaussian Process models on various datasets, including a large
spatial-temporal dataset of $n>10^6$ points collected from an earth-observing
satellite. Our results show that GpGpU achieves faster runtimes and better

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image anomaly detection methods are impractical as astronomical imaging data grows massively, necessitating scalable solutions.

Method: The paper employs a semi-supervised pipeline combining a vision transformer (ViT) trained with self-supervised learning and a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier.

Result: The pipeline identified 780 problematic DECaLS exposures, verified through visual inspection, showing accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: This adaptable machine-learning solution provides scalable quality control for large imaging surveys, reducing dependency on human visual inspection.

Abstract: As the data volume of astronomical imaging surveys rapidly increases,
traditional methods for image anomaly detection, such as visual inspection by
human experts, are becoming impractical. We introduce a machine-learning-based
approach to detect poor-quality exposures in large imaging surveys, with a
focus on the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) in regions of low extinction (i.e.,
$E(B-V)<0.04$). Our semi-supervised pipeline integrates a vision transformer
(ViT), trained via self-supervised learning (SSL), with a k-Nearest Neighbor
(kNN) classifier. We train and validate our pipeline using a small set of
labeled exposures observed by surveys with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). A
clustering-space analysis of where our pipeline places images labeled in
``good'' and ``bad'' categories suggests that our approach can efficiently and
accurately determine the quality of exposures. Applied to new imaging being
reduced for DECaLS Data Release 11, our pipeline identifies 780 problematic
exposures, which we subsequently verify through visual inspection. Being highly
efficient and adaptable, our method offers a scalable solution for quality
control in other large imaging surveys.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional symbolic regression algorithms face challenges including uncertainty in identifying good functions and ambiguity in selection procedures.

Method: Proposes an exhaustive search combined with the minimum description length principle to balance complexity and accuracy in model selection.

Result: The proposed algorithm succeeded in generating superior functions for astrophysical problems, surpassing existing literature standards.

Conclusion: The method offers a general-purpose, scalable solution for symbolic regression with potential utility across scientific domains.

Abstract: Symbolic regression is the machine learning method for learning functions
from data. After a brief overview of the symbolic regression landscape, I will
describe the two main challenges that traditional algorithms face: they have an
unknown (and likely significant) probability of failing to find any given good
function, and they suffer from ambiguity and poorly-justified assumptions in
their function-selection procedure. To address these I propose an exhaustive
search and model selection by the minimum description length principle, which
allows accuracy and complexity to be directly traded off by measuring each in
units of information. I showcase the resulting publicly available Exhaustive
Symbolic Regression algorithm on three open problems in astrophysics: the
expansion history of the universe, the effective behaviour of gravity in
galaxies and the potential of the inflaton field. In each case the algorithm
identifies many functions superior to the literature standards. This general
purpose methodology should find widespread utility in science and beyond.

TL;DR: The paper presents a deep Koopman approach using neural networks for autonomous vehicle modeling and control, yielding improved real-time tracking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate modeling and control of autonomous vehicles are difficult due to nonlinear and coupled vehicle dynamics, and deploying linear control techniques through Koopman operator theory remains challenging.

Method: A deep neural network learns the Koopman operator and its invariant subspace within the curvilinear Frenet frame, incorporating bilinear input-state interactions and leveraging a multi-step prediction loss for long-horizon accuracy.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated reduced tracking errors and real-time feasibility during hardware-in-the-loop experiments using a CarSim RT model and dSPACE SCALEXIO system.

Conclusion: This approach proves to be effective for real-time trajectory tracking and control in embedded autonomous vehicle systems.

Abstract: Accurate modeling and control of autonomous vehicles remain a fundamental
challenge due to the nonlinear and coupled nature of vehicle dynamics. While
Koopman operator theory offers a framework for deploying powerful linear
control techniques, learning a finite-dimensional invariant subspace for
high-fidelity modeling continues to be an open problem. This paper presents a
deep Koopman approach for modeling and control of vehicle dynamics within the
curvilinear Frenet frame. The proposed framework uses a deep neural network
architecture to simultaneously learn the Koopman operator and its associated
invariant subspace from the data. Input-state bilinear interactions are
captured by the algorithm while preserving convexity, which makes it suitable
for real-time model predictive control (MPC) application. A multi-step
prediction loss is utilized during training to ensure long-horizon prediction
capability. To further enhance real-time trajectory tracking performance, the
model is integrated with a cumulative error regulator (CER) module, which
compensates for model mismatch by mitigating accumulated prediction errors.
Closed-loop performance is evaluated through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)
experiments using a CarSim RT model as the target plant, with real-time
validation conducted on a dSPACE SCALEXIO system. The proposed controller
achieved significant reductions in tracking error relative to baseline
controllers, confirming its suitability for real-time implementation in
embedded autonomous vehicle systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inaccuracies in TMC estimation caused by poor lighting and weather conditions with existing camera-based methods by utilizing LiDAR technology.

Method: Deployed and evaluated a dual-LiDAR system at an intersection to classify and analyze vehicle movements and types using 3D bounding box detections.

Result: The dual-LiDAR system provided estimates of TMC and insights into traffic trends and irregularities.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of dual-LiDAR systems in improving TMC estimation and suggests advancements for trajectory forecasting and intent prediction.

Abstract: Traffic Movement Count (TMC) at intersections is crucial for optimizing
signal timings, assessing the performance of existing traffic control measures,
and proposing efficient lane configurations to minimize delays, reduce
congestion, and promote safety. Traditionally, methods such as manual counting,
loop detectors, pneumatic road tubes, and camera-based recognition have been
used for TMC estimation. Although generally reliable, camera-based TMC
estimation is prone to inaccuracies under poor lighting conditions during harsh
weather and nighttime. In contrast, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
technology is gaining popularity in recent times due to reduced costs and its
expanding use in 3D object detection, tracking, and related applications. This
paper presents the authors' endeavor to develop, deploy and evaluate a
dual-LiDAR system at an intersection in the city of Rialto, California, for TMC
estimation. The 3D bounding box detections from the two LiDARs are used to
classify vehicle counts based on traffic directions, vehicle movements, and
vehicle classes. This work discusses the estimated TMC results and provides
insights into the observed trends and irregularities. Potential improvements
are also discussed that could enhance not only TMC estimation, but also
trajectory forecasting and intent prediction at intersections.

*Keishi Sando,Hideitsu Hino*

Main category: math.CO

TL;DR: This paper introduces the complex non-backtracking matrix that combines Hermitian adjacency matrix and non-backtracking matrix properties, revealing clustering capabilities, especially in sparse directed graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for analyzing directed graph structures, such as Hermitian adjacency matrices, have shown value for clustering, but there is a need for more robust tools integrating multiple advantages.

Method: The authors proposed a novel complex non-backtracking matrix that merges the features of Hermitian adjacency matrices and non-backtracking matrices, analyzing its mathematical properties and relationships.

Result: They demonstrated that the new matrix retains cluster information, particularly excelling in the context of sparse directed graphs.

Conclusion: The complex non-backtracking matrix provides advanced insight into directed graph clustering and enriches the tools available for graph representation analysis.

Abstract: Graph representation matrices are essential tools in graph data analysis.
Recently, Hermitian adjacency matrices have been proposed to investigate
directed graph structures. Previous studies have demonstrated that these
matrices can extract valuable information for clustering. In this paper, we
propose the complex non-backtracking matrix that integrates the properties of
the Hermitian adjacency matrix and the non-backtracking matrix. The proposed
matrix has similar properties with the non-backtracking matrix of undirected
graphs. We reveal relationships between the complex non-backtracking matrix and
the Hermitian adjacency matrix. Also, we provide intriguing insights that this
matrix representation holds cluster information, particularly for sparse
directed graphs.

### [326] [Rookie Mistakes: Measuring Software Quality in Student Projects to Guide Educational Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12488)
*Marco De Luca,Sergio Di Martino,Sergio Di Meglio,Anna Rita Fasolino,Luigi Libero Lucio Starace,Porfirio Tramontana*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper identifies common software quality issues in intermediate-level university programming projects using static analysis tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited emphasis on software quality in Software Engineering courses, especially for intermediate-level students working on object-oriented projects.

Method: Analyzed 83 object-oriented team projects (developed by 172 students) using a static analysis pipeline (SonarQube and ArchUnit) to detect code smells and architectural anti-patterns.

Result: Identified recurring quality issues and challenges faced by students at the intermediate level.

Conclusion: Provides guidance for educators to improve curricula and focus on quality-oriented development practices in Software Engineering education.

Abstract: When teaching Programming and Software Engineering in Bachelor's Degree
programs, the emphasis on creating functional software projects often
overshadows the focus on software quality, a trend that aligns with ACM
curricula recommendations. Software Engineering courses are typically
introduced later in the curriculum, and can generally allocate only limited
time to quality-related topics, leaving educators with the challenge of
deciding which quality aspects to prioritize. In this decision, the literature
offers limited guidance, as most existing studies focus on code written by
novice students and small code units, making it unclear whether those findings
extend to intermediate-level students with foundational object-oriented
programming skills working on more complex software projects. To address this
gap, we analyze 83 object-oriented team projects developed by 172 university
students across 4 different editions of the Object-Oriented Programming course.
We apply a static analysis pipeline used in prior research to assess software
quality, combining SonarQube and ArchUnit to detect code smells and
architectural anti-patterns. Our findings highlight recurring quality issues
and offer concrete evidence of the challenges students face at this stage,
providing valuable guidance for educators aiming to continuously improve
Software Engineering curricula and promote quality-oriented development
practices.

*Mihran Miroyan,Rose Niousha,Joseph E. Gonzalez,Gireeja Ranade,Narges Norouzi*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper studies Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to simulate student-like programming behaviors and evaluates their performance after fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs can generate code like real students—imperfect, iterative, and stylistically varied—to better model learning processes in educational contexts.

Method: The authors use timestamped student submission data and design experiments modeling student progress. They fine-tune LLMs and evaluate outputs across semantic, functional, and stylistic dimensions.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs better emulate real student learning trajectories, capturing errors, incremental progress, and varied styles.

Conclusion: Realistic student code modeling demands accounting for learning dynamics through context-aware generation, temporal modeling, and multi-dimensional evaluations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on programming
tasks, but can they generate student-like code like real students - imperfect,
iterative, and stylistically diverse? We present ParaStudent, a systematic
study of LLM-based "student-like" code generation in an introductory
programming course setting. Using a dataset of timestamped student submissions
across multiple semesters, we design low- and high-resolution experiments to
model student progress and evaluate code outputs along semantic, functional,
and stylistic dimensions. Our results show that fine-tuning significantly
improves alignment with real student trajectories and captures error patterns,
incremental improvements, and stylistic variations more faithfully. This study
shows that modeling realistic student code requires capturing learning dynamics
through context-aware generation, temporal modeling, and multi-dimensional
evaluation. Code for experiments and evaluation is available at

### [328] [The Case for Contextual Copyleft: Licensing Open Source Training Data and Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12713)
*Grant Shanklin,Emmie Hine,Claudio Novelli,Tyler Schroder,Luciano Floridi*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Contextual Copyleft AI (CCAI) license to extend traditional open source principles to generative AI models and evaluates its legal and policy justifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of generative AI systems presents challenges for the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) community in preserving copyleft principles, particularly when open source code is used to train AI models.

Method: The authors introduce the CCAI license and employ a three-part evaluation framework focusing on legal feasibility, policy justification, and cross-contextual benefits and risks.

Result: The CCAI license enhances control for developers, supports open source AI development, and addresses openwashing but highlights risks associated with misuse, necessitating regulatory safeguards.

Conclusion: The CCAI license is a feasible and effective mechanism to adapt FOSS principles to generative AI under a strong regulatory framework for responsible AI use.

Abstract: The proliferation of generative AI systems has created new challenges for the
Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) community, particularly regarding how
traditional copyleft principles should apply when open source code is used to
train AI models. This article introduces the Contextual Copyleft AI (CCAI)
license, a novel licensing mechanism that extends copyleft requirements from
training data to the resulting generative AI models. The CCAI license offers
significant advantages, including enhanced developer control, incentivization
of open source AI development, and mitigation of openwashing practices. This is
demonstrated through a structured three-part evaluation framework that examines
(1) legal feasibility under current copyright law, (2) policy justification
comparing traditional software and AI contexts, and (3) synthesis of
cross-contextual benefits and risks. However, the increased risk profile of
open source AI, particularly the potential for direct misuse, necessitates
complementary regulatory approaches to achieve an appropriate risk-benefit
balance. The paper concludes that when implemented within a robust regulatory
environment focused on responsible AI usage, the CCAI license provides a viable
mechanism for preserving and adapting core FOSS principles to the evolving
landscape of generative AI development.

### [329] [The carbon cost of materials discovery: Can machine learning really accelerate the discovery of new photovoltaics?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13246)
*Matthew Walker,Keith T. Butler*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of machine learning surrogates to replace density functional theory-based workflows for photovoltaic material screening, optimizing efficiency while reducing computational costs and environmental impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the significant computational and environmental costs associated with density functional theory calculations in the search for high-performance photovoltaic materials.

Method: The researchers reproduced a DFT-based screening workflow, progressively integrating machine learning surrogates to evaluate trade-offs between computational accuracy and CO$_2$ emissions.

Result: The study identified hybrid ML/DFT strategies that balance predictive accuracy and environmental cost, highlighting that ML-driven approaches can outperform traditional DFT workflows in screening applications.

Conclusion: Machine learning models are effective and environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional DFT workflows, offering a pathway for high-throughput and low-emission discovery of photovoltaic materials.

Abstract: Computational screening has become a powerful complement to experimental
efforts in the discovery of high-performance photovoltaic (PV) materials. Most
workflows rely on density functional theory (DFT) to estimate electronic and
optical properties relevant to solar energy conversion. Although more efficient
than laboratory-based methods, DFT calculations still entail substantial
computational and environmental costs. Machine learning (ML) models have
recently gained attention as surrogates for DFT, offering drastic reductions in
resource use with competitive predictive performance. In this study, we
reproduce a canonical DFT-based workflow to estimate the maximum efficiency
limit and progressively replace its components with ML surrogates. By
quantifying the CO$_2$ emissions associated with each computational strategy,
we evaluate the trade-offs between predictive efficacy and environmental cost.
Our results reveal multiple hybrid ML/DFT strategies that optimize different
points along the accuracy--emissions front. We find that direct prediction of
scalar quantities, such as maximum efficiency, is significantly more tractable
than using predicted absorption spectra as an intermediate step. Interestingly,
ML models trained on DFT data can outperform DFT workflows using alternative
exchange--correlation functionals in screening applications, highlighting the
consistency and utility of data-driven approaches. We also assess strategies to
improve ML-driven screening through expanded datasets and improved model
architectures tailored to PV-relevant features. This work provides a
quantitative framework for building low-emission, high-throughput discovery
pipelines.
