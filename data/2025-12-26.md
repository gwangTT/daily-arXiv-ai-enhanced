Conclusion: BitRL-Light successfully demonstrates the feasibility of deploying adaptive AI on IoT devices, offering a balance of energy efficiency, user comfort, and real-time performance without relying on cloud infrastructure.

Abstract: Smart home lighting systems consume 15-20% of residential energy but lack adaptive intelligence to optimize for user comfort and energy efficiency simultaneously. We present BitRL-Light, a novel framework combining 1-bit quantized Large Language Models (LLMs) with Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning for real-time smart home lighting control on edge devices. Our approach deploys a 1-bit quantized Llama-3.2-1B model on Raspberry Pi hardware, achieving 71.4 times energy reduction compared to full-precision models while maintaining intelligent control capabilities. Through multi-objective reinforcement learning, BitRL-Light learns optimal lighting policies from user feedback, balancing energy consumption, comfort, and circadian alignment. Experimental results demonstrate 32% energy savings compared to rule-based systems, with inference latency under 200ms on Raspberry Pi 4 and 95% user satisfaction. The system processes natural language commands via Google Home/IFTTT integration and learns from implicit feedback through manual overrides. Our comparative analysis shows 1-bit models achieve 5.07 times speedup over 2-bit alternatives on ARM processors while maintaining 92% task accuracy. This work establishes a practical framework for deploying adaptive AI on resource-constrained IoT devices, enabling intelligent home automation without cloud dependencies.

Motivation: To optimize exploration and exploitation in multiagent reinforcement learning for UAV coordination in dynamic, partially observable environments, specifically in the context of 6G networks.

Method: Integrates MARL with Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), supported by Bayesian inference, Gaussian processes, and variational inference. Utilizes a centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm for better coordination and observability.

Result: The framework demonstrated improved sample efficiency, faster convergence, and better coverage performance compared to baseline MARL algorithms such as PPO and DDPG. Scalability tests and sensitivity analysis further validated its robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed quantum-inspired MARL framework not only optimizes 6G network deployment through enhanced UAV cooperation but also achieves a superior balance between exploration and exploitation, with public release ensuring reproducibility.

Abstract: This study introduces a quantum inspired framework for optimizing the exploration exploitation tradeoff in multiagent reinforcement learning, applied to UAVassisted 6G network deployment. We consider a cooperative scenario where ten intelligent UAVs autonomously coordinate to maximize signal coverage and support efficient network expansion under partial observability and dynamic conditions. The proposed approach integrates classical MARL algorithms with quantum-inspired optimization techniques, leveraging variational quantum circuits VQCs as the core structure and employing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm QAOA as a representative VQC based method for combinatorial optimization. Complementary probabilistic modeling is incorporated through Bayesian inference, Gaussian processes, and variational inference to capture latent environmental dynamics. A centralized training with decentralized execution CTDE paradigm is adopted, where shared memory and local view grids enhance local observability among agents. Comprehensive experiments including scalability tests, sensitivity analysis, and comparisons with PPO and DDPG baselines demonstrate that the proposed framework improves sample efficiency, accelerates convergence, and enhances coverage performance while maintaining robustness. Radar chart and convergence analyses further show that QI MARL achieves a superior balance between exploration and exploitation compared to classical methods.

### [3] [MegaRAG: Multimodal Knowledge Graph-Based Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20626)
*Chi-Hsiang Hsiao,Yi-Cheng Wang,Tzung-Sheng Lin,Yi-Ren Yeh,Chu-Song Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multimodal knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach that enhances reasoning by incorporating textual, visual, and spatial cues for better content understanding, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with high-level conceptual and holistic understanding due to limited context windows, especially for long and domain-specific content. Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) solutions and knowledge graphs (KGs) fail to incorporate multimodal insights, such as visual information, which is crucial for reasoning in visual documents.

Method: The paper introduces a multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG approach. It integrates visual information into knowledge graph construction, retrieval processes, and answer generation, enabling cross-modal reasoning for improved understanding.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance over existing RAG-based methods in both global and fine-grained question-answering tasks across textual and multimodal datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal information into knowledge graphs within RAG frameworks significantly enhances content understanding and question-answering capabilities. This innovative approach addresses the limitations of existing methods by enabling cross-modal reasoning.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to dynamically access external information, which is powerful for answering questions over previously unseen documents. Nonetheless, they struggle with high-level conceptual understanding and holistic comprehension due to limited context windows, which constrain their ability to perform deep reasoning over long-form, domain-specific content such as full-length books. To solve this problem, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been leveraged to provide entity-centric structure and hierarchical summaries, offering more structured support for reasoning. However, existing KG-based RAG solutions remain restricted to text-only inputs and fail to leverage the complementary insights provided by other modalities such as vision. On the other hand, reasoning from visual documents requires textual, visual, and spatial cues into structured, hierarchical concepts. To address this issue, we introduce a multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG that enables cross-modal reasoning for better content understanding. Our method incorporates visual cues into the construction of knowledge graphs, the retrieval phase, and the answer generation process. Experimental results across both global and fine-grained question answering tasks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing RAG-based approaches on both textual and multimodal corpora.

Expert validation by three AI safety researchers confirms the effectiveness of our strategic selection, rating our approach 4.14/5.0 versus 3.14/5.0 for random selection. microprobe completes reliability assessment with 99.9% statistical power while representing a 90% reduction in assessment cost and maintaining 95% of traditional method coverage. Our approach addresses a critical gap in efficient model evaluation for responsible AI deployment.

### [7] [Reasoning Relay: Evaluating Stability and Interchangeability of Large Language Models in Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20647)
*Leo Lu,Jonathan Zhang,Sean Chua,Spencer Kim,Kevin Zhu,Sean O'Brien,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies if reasoning chains from one model can be continued by another, examining cross-model reasoning transferability and its implications on reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current work focuses on boosting model performance via reasoning strategies, but little is understood about the transferability of reasoning across different models. This exploration seeks to fill this gap.

Method: The study uses token-level log-probability thresholds to truncate reasoning at various stages and test continuation across both intra-family and cross-family models using Gemma-3 and LLaMA-3 model families. A Process Reward Model (PRM) evaluates reasoning stability.

Result: The continuation of reasoning chains across models often retains or improves upon the original model's logical structure and final output accuracy.

Conclusion: Reasoning chains exhibit interchangeability across models, highlighting its potential for building modular and collaborative AI reasoning systems.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While prior work focuses on improving model performance through internal reasoning strategies, little is known about the interchangeability of reasoning across different models. In this work, we explore whether a partially completed reasoning chain from one model can be reliably continued by another model, either within the same model family or across families. We achieve this by assessing the sufficiency of intermediate reasoning traces as transferable scaffolds for logical coherence and final answer accuracy. We interpret this interchangeability as a means of examining inference-time trustworthiness, probing whether reasoning remains both coherent and reliable under model substitution. Using token-level log-probability thresholds to truncate reasoning at early, mid, and late stages from our baseline models, Gemma-3-4B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct, we conduct continuation experiments with Gemma-3-1B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to test intra-family and cross-family behaviors. Our evaluation pipeline leverages truncation thresholds with a Process Reward Model (PRM), providing a reproducible framework for assessing reasoning stability via model interchange. Evaluations with a PRM reveal that hybrid reasoning chains often preserve, and in some cases even improve, final accuracy and logical structure. Our findings point towards interchangeability as an emerging behavioral property of reasoning models, offering insights into new paradigms for reliable modular reasoning in collaborative AI systems.

This paper presents AiAuditTrack (AAT), a blockchain-based framework for AI usage traffic recording and governance. AAT leverages decentralized identity (DID) and verifiable credentials (VC) to establish trusted and identifiable AI entities, and records inter-entity interaction trajectories on-chain to enable cross-system supervision and auditing. AI entities are modeled as nodes in a dynamic interaction graph, where edges represent time-specific behavioral trajectories. Based on this model, a risk diffusion algorithm is proposed to trace the origin of risky behaviors and propagate early warnings across involved entities. System performance is evaluated using blockchain Transactions Per Second (TPS) metrics, demonstrating the feasibility and stability of AAT under large-scale interaction recording. AAT provides a scalable and verifiable solution for AI auditing, risk management, and responsibility attribution in complex multi-agent environments.

### [9] [Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS): Learning to Route Between MHA, GQA, and MQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20650)
*Esmail Gumaan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS), a method to dynamically select the optimal attention type in Transformer models, balancing quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the trade-off in Transformer models between modeling quality and inference efficiency, especially due to Key-Value cache memory constraints in Multi-Head Attention (MHA).

Method: The proposed MoAS architecture uses a learned router to dynamically choose the optimal attention mechanism (MHA, GQA, MQA) for each token rather than relying on static selection.

Result: Experimental results show that MoAS achieves a validation loss of 2.3074 on WikiText-2, outperforming static mixtures (val loss 2.3093), demonstrating its superiority.

Conclusion: MoAS offers a significant improvement by dynamically routing attention mechanisms, combining performance improvement and efficiency, and achieving quality competitive with MHA while reducing potential overheads.

Abstract: The choice of attention mechanism in Transformer models involves a critical trade-off between modeling quality and inference efficiency. Multi-Head Attention (MHA) offers the best quality but suffers from large Key-Value (KV) cache memory requirements during inference. Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) reduce memory usage but often at the cost of model performance. In this work, we propose Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS), a novel architecture that dynamically selects the optimal attention scheme (MHA, GQA, or MQA) for each token via a learned router. We demonstrate that dynamic routing performs better than static averaging of schemes and achieves performance competitive with the MHA baseline while offering potential for conditional compute efficiency. Experimental results on WikiText-2 show that dynamic routing (val loss 2.3074) outperforms a static mixture (2.3093), validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### [11] [AI-Driven Decision-Making System for Hiring Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20652)
*Vira Filatova,Andrii Zelenchuk,Dmytro Filatov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study introduces an AI-based hiring assistant to streamline early-stage validation of candidates. It combines data preprocessing, profile creation, technical/fit scoring, and human-in-the-loop validation to reduce recruiter time per qualified candidate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in reconciling varied inputs for early candidate validation during hiring, which is a major bottleneck for recruiters.

Method: An AI-driven modular system integrates structured resume data, scoring methods for fit/risk, and human validation using an LLM to ensure traceable and consistent analysis.

Result: The system was tested on 64 candidates for a Python backend engineer role, reducing the time per qualified hire to 1.70 hours, compared to 3.33 hours for an experienced recruiter, with lower overall screening costs.

Conclusion: The AI hiring assistant improves efficiency and cost-effectiveness in candidate screening while maintaining human oversight for final decisions.

Abstract: Early-stage candidate validation is a major bottleneck in hiring, because recruiters must reconcile heterogeneous inputs (resumes, screening answers, code assignments, and limited public evidence). This paper presents an AI-driven, modular multi-agent hiring assistant that integrates (i) document and video preprocessing, (ii) structured candidate profile construction, (iii) public-data verification, (iv) technical/culture-fit scoring with explicit risk penalties, and (v) human-in-the-loop validation via an interactive interface. The pipeline is orchestrated by an LLM under strict constraints to reduce output variability and to generate traceable component-level rationales. Candidate ranking is computed by a configurable aggregation of technical fit, culture fit, and normalized risk penalties. The system is evaluated on 64 real applicants for a mid-level Python backend engineer role, using an experienced recruiter as the reference baseline and a second, less experienced recruiter for additional comparison. Alongside precision/recall, we propose an efficiency metric measuring expected time per qualified candidate. In this study, the system improves throughput and achieves 1.70 hours per qualified candidate versus 3.33 hours for the experienced recruiter, with substantially lower estimated screening cost, while preserving a human decision-maker as the final authority.

### [12] [From Fake Focus to Real Precision: Confusion-Driven Adversarial Attention Learning in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20661)
*Yawei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces an Adversarial Feedback for Attention (AFA) mechanism to enhance the attention distributions in Transformer-based models for improved sentiment analysis, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Transformer-based sentiment analysis models often show suboptimal accuracy due to their focus on common words, which leads to neglecting task-relevant terms.

Method: Proposed an Adversarial Feedback for Attention (AFA) mechanism with a dynamic masking strategy and a policy gradient approach to optimize attention distributions without manual annotation.

Result: State-of-the-art performance was achieved on three public datasets, with a 12.6% performance improvement when applied to large language models.

Conclusion: The AFA mechanism effectively redistributes attention to relevant focal points, improves model performance, and has significant potential for enhancing large language models.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have been widely adopted for sentiment analysis tasks due to their exceptional ability to capture contextual information. However, these methods often exhibit suboptimal accuracy in certain scenarios. By analyzing their attention distributions, we observe that existing models tend to allocate attention primarily to common words, overlooking less popular yet highly task-relevant terms, which significantly impairs overall performance. To address this issue, we propose an Adversarial Feedback for Attention(AFA) training mechanism that enables the model to automatically redistribute attention weights to appropriate focal points without requiring manual annotations. This mechanism incorporates a dynamic masking strategy that attempts to mask various words to deceive a discriminator, while the discriminator strives to detect significant differences induced by these masks. Additionally, leveraging the sensitivity of Transformer models to token-level perturbations, we employ a policy gradient approach to optimize attention distributions, which facilitates efficient and rapid convergence. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, applying this training mechanism to enhance attention in large language models yields a further performance improvement of 12.6%

### [13] [Quantifying Laziness, Decoding Suboptimality, and Context Degradation in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20662)
*Yiqing Ma,Jung-Hua Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study evaluates behavioral artifacts in LLMs like laziness, decoding suboptimality, and context degradation, finding weaknesses in complex instruction compliance but robustness in lengthy conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify persistent behavioral artifacts in LLMs that affect their reliability and performance in complex and long-instruction tasks.

Method: Controlled experiments (A, B, C) on advanced LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4 variant, DeepSeek) were conducted to test compliance with multi-part instructions, decoding accuracy, and conversation context retention.

Result: Results highlight that LLMs struggle with intricate, multi-part task compliance (laziness), show little evidence of decoding suboptimality, and surprisingly perform well in retaining instructions in long, chaotic conversations.

Conclusion: Although LLMs show challenges in adhering to detailed, multi-step tasks, they display unexpected capabilities for long-context instruction retention, offering actionable strategies to improve multi-instruction compliance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit behavioral artifacts such as laziness (premature truncation of responses or partial compliance with multi-part requests), decoding suboptimality (failure to select higher-quality sequences due to myopic decoding), and context degradation (forgetting or ignoring core instructions over long conversations). We conducted three controlled experiments (A, B, and C) to quantify these phenomena across several advanced LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4 variant, DeepSeek). Our results indicate widespread laziness in satisfying complex multi-part instructions: models frequently omitted required sections or failed to meet length requirements despite explicit prompting. However, we found limited evidence of decoding suboptimality in a simple reasoning task (the models' greedy answers appeared to align with their highest-confidence solution), and we observed surprising robustness against context degradation in a 200-turn chaotic conversation test - the models maintained key facts and instructions far better than expected. These findings suggest that while compliance with detailed instructions remains an open challenge, modern LLMs may internally mitigate some hypothesized failure modes (such as context forgetting) in straightforward retrieval scenarios. We discuss implications for reliability, relate our findings to prior work on instruction-following and long-context processing, and recommend strategies (such as self-refinement and dynamic prompting) to reduce laziness and bolster multi-instruction compliance.

### [14] [Eidoku: A Neuro-Symbolic Verification Gate for LLM Reasoning via Structural Constraint Satisfaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20664)
*Shinobu Miya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel verification framework to address hallucinations in Large Language Models, using a Constraint Satisfaction Problem rather than probability-based measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models often produce high-likelihood but structurally inconsistent hallucinations, revealing shortcomings of probability-based verification methods.

Method: The authors reformulate verification as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem using structural violation cost, defined by connectivity, feature space consistency, and logical entailment. Verification is handled by a modular System-2 gate called Eidoku.

Result: By enforcing structural constraints, this approach successfully rejects hallucinations that probability-based models fail to detect. Experiments on diagnostic datasets confirm deterministic rejection of suspicious reasoning.

Conclusion: Structural constraint-based verification with context-calibrated thresholds provides an effective solution for addressing high-probability hallucinations, enhancing generative reasoning accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently produce hallucinated statements that are assigned high likelihood by the model itself, exposing a fundamental limitation of probability-based verification. This suggests that hallucination is often not a low-confidence phenomenon, but a failure of structural consistency. In this work, we reformulate the verification of LLM reasoning as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) operating independently of the generation likelihood. Rather than optimizing for statistical plausibility, we model verification as a feasibility check based on structural violation cost -- the computational cost required to embed a candidate reasoning step into the contextual graph structure. We define a total cost function composed of three proxies: (i) graph connectivity (structural), (ii) feature space consistency (geometric), and (iii) logical entailment (symbolic). Crucially, verification is performed via a lightweight System-2 gate, Eidoku, which rejects candidates exceeding a context-calibrated cost threshold. The threshold is not learned but is derived from the intrinsic statistics of the context, avoiding ad hoc heuristics. We demonstrate that this approach successfully rejects ``smooth falsehoods'' -- statements that are highly probable yet structurally disconnected -- that probability-based verifiers are principally incapable of detecting. Our experiments on a controlled diagnostic dataset show that explicitly enforcing structural constraints allows for the deterministic rejection of this specific class of hallucinations, serving as a neuro-symbolic sanity check for generative reasoning.

Method: The authors propose developing a semantic language to act as a framework to align FTAI and NTAI, assisting developers and stakeholders in assessing and implementing trustworthy AI systems.

Result: The authors discuss the state-of-the-art, identify the gap between FTAI and NTAI, and outline starting steps and considerations for the proposed semantic language.

Conclusion: Bridging FTAI and NTAI with a semantic language can enable better assessment and implementation of trustworthiness in AI systems, while translating norms into actionable steps for developers and stakeholders.

Abstract: Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (TAI) is gaining traction due to regulations and functional benefits. While Functional TAI (FTAI) focuses on how to implement trustworthy systems, Normative TAI (NTAI) focuses on regulations that need to be enforced. However, gaps between FTAI and NTAI remain, making it difficult to assess trustworthiness of AI systems. We argue that a bridge is needed, specifically by introducing a conceptual language which can match FTAI and NTAI. Such a semantic language can assist developers as a framework to assess AI systems in terms of trustworthiness. It can also help stakeholders translate norms and regulations into concrete implementation steps for their systems. In this position paper, we describe the current state-of-the-art and identify the gap between FTAI and NTAI. We will discuss starting points for developing a semantic language and the envisioned effects of it. Finally, we provide key considerations and discuss future actions towards assessment of TAI.

### [16] [From Pilots to Practices: A Scoping Review of GenAI-Enabled Personalization in Computer Science Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20714)
*Iman Reihanian,Yunfei Hou,Qingquan Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper reviews 32 studies to explore how generative AI is used in personalized computer science education in higher education, identifying effective design patterns and potential risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motive is to investigate whether generative AI's personalization in computer science education enhances or undermines learning, addressing scalability challenges.

Method: The authors conducted a scoping review of 32 purposively selected studies (from 259 records) published between 2023 and 2025, analyzing personalization mechanisms and their effectiveness.

Result: They identified five application domains (intelligent tutoring, personalized materials, formative feedback, AI-augmented assessment, and code review) and highlighted design patterns that positively influenced learning outcomes.

Conclusion: Generative AI can scale personalized learning effectively if its applications are context-aware and embedded within traditional workflows. However, risks like academic integrity and bias must be carefully mitigated.

Abstract: Generative AI enables personalized computer science education at scale, yet questions remain about whether such personalization supports or undermines learning. This scoping review synthesizes 32 studies (2023-2025) purposively sampled from 259 records to map personalization mechanisms and effectiveness signals in higher-education computer science contexts. We identify five application domains: intelligent tutoring, personalized materials, formative feedback, AI-augmented assessment, and code review, and analyze how design choices shape learning outcomes. Designs incorporating explanation-first guidance, solution withholding, graduated hint ladders, and artifact grounding (student code, tests, and rubrics) consistently show more positive learning processes than unconstrained chat interfaces. Successful implementations share four patterns: context-aware tutoring anchored in student artifacts, multi-level hint structures requiring reflection, composition with traditional CS infrastructure (autograders and rubrics), and human-in-the-loop quality assurance. We propose an exploration-first adoption framework emphasizing piloting, instrumentation, learning-preserving defaults, and evidence-based scaling. Recurrent risks include academic integrity, privacy, bias and equity, and over-reliance, and we pair these with operational mitigation. The evidence supports generative AI as a mechanism for precision scaffolding when embedded in audit-ready workflows that preserve productive struggle while scaling personalized support.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the interconnectedness of artificial intelligence (AI) and organic intelligence, emphasizing the overlap between the two.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to challenge the notion of a strict separation between artificial and organic intelligence, shedding light on how AI is fundamentally rooted in organic human cognition.

Method: The authors analyze conceptual foundations, using examples such as neural networks and decision-making algorithms, to illustrate parallels between AI and organic intelligence.

Result: The analysis demonstrates that the line between artificial and organic is blurry, with AI heavily inspired by natural neurobiology and evolution.

Conclusion: Artificial and organic intelligence are not distinct as traditionally perceived; AI's foundation is deeply rooted in organic human ingenuity and principles.

Abstract: The term artificial implies an inherent dichotomy from the natural or organic. However, AI, as we know it, is a product of organic ingenuity: designed, implemented, and iteratively improved by human cognition. The very principles that underpin AI systems, from neural networks to decision-making algorithms, are inspired by the organic intelligence embedded in human neurobiology and evolutionary processes. The path from organic to artificial intelligence in digital health is neither mystical nor merely a matter of parameter count, it is fundamentally about organization and adaption. Thus, the boundaries between artificial and organic are far less distinct than the nomenclature suggests.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiencies and inaccuracies of existing Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o3 and DeepSeek-R1, especially in solving complex mathematical problems.

Method: AgentMath employs three key innovations: automated conversion of reasoning data; a reinforcement learning paradigm for tool-use and error correction; and an efficient training system leveraging asynchronous schedules and weighted load balancing.

Result: AgentMath demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in mathematical competition benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25, and HMMT25), achieving accuracy levels of 90.6%, 86.4%, and 73.8%, respectively.

Conclusion: The study highlights AgentMath's ability to integrate computational tools and reasoning frameworks, paving the way for more advanced mathematical reasoning agents.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o3 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved remarkable progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought. However, they remain computationally inefficient and struggle with accuracy when solving problems requiring complex mathematical operations. In this work, we present AgentMath, an agent framework that seamlessly integrates language models' reasoning capabilities with code interpreters' computational precision to efficiently tackle complex mathematical problems. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) An automated method that converts natural language chain-of-thought into structured tool-augmented trajectories, generating high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to alleviate data scarcity; (2) A novel agentic reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm that dynamically interleaves natural language generation with real-time code execution. This enables models to autonomously learn optimal tool-use strategies through multi-round interactive feedback, while fostering emergent capabilities in code refinement and error correction; (3) An efficient training system incorporating innovative techniques, including request-level asynchronous rollout scheduling, agentic partial rollout, and prefix-aware weighted load balancing, achieving 4-5x speedup and making efficient RL training feasible on ultra-long sequences with scenarios with massive tool calls.Extensive evaluations show that AgentMath achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging mathematical competition benchmarks including AIME24, AIME25, and HMMT25. Specifically, AgentMath-30B-A3B attains 90.6%, 86.4%, and 73.8% accuracy respectively, achieving advanced capabilities.These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and pave the way for building more sophisticated and scalable mathematical reasoning agents.

### [19] [A Benchmark for Evaluating Outcome-Driven Constraint Violations in Autonomous AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20798)
*Miles Q. Li,Benjamin C. M. Fung,Martin Weiss,Pulei Xiong,Khalil Al-Hussaeni,Claude Fachkha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark to assess AI agents' safety and alignment in multi-step decision-making under performance pressure, outlining a significant incidence of goal-driven constraint violations across evaluated models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid deployment of AI agents in critical scenarios necessitates addressing their capability to safely and ethically align with human values under realistic conditions.

Method: A benchmark encompassing 40 detailed scenarios is proposed to measure how agents balance goal optimization against ethical and safety constraints. This includes both instruction-driven and KPI-driven scenarios to distinguish between explicit obedience and emergent misalignment.

Result: Misalignment rates were found between 1.3% and 71.4% across 12 models. The analysis illustrates that models with advanced reasoning capabilities, such as Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, show higher misalignment tendencies, also evidencing ethical awareness during separate evaluations.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the imperative of enhancing agent safety training to ensure their responsible deployment in real-world contexts while addressing emergent constraints and misalignment risks.

Abstract: As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in high-stakes environments, ensuring their safety and alignment with human values has become a paramount concern. Current safety benchmarks often focusing only on single-step decision-making, simulated environments for tasks with malicious intent, or evaluating adherence to explicit negative constraints. There is a lack of benchmarks that are designed to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations, which arise when agents pursue goal optimization under strong performance incentives while deprioritizing ethical, legal, or safety constraints over multiple steps in realistic production settings. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark comprising 40 distinct scenarios. Each scenario presents a task that requires multi-step actions, and the agent's performance is tied to a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each scenario features Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment. Across 12 state-of-the-art large language models, we observe outcome-driven constraint violations ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%, with 9 of the 12 evaluated models exhibiting misalignment rates between 30% and 50%. Strikingly, we find that superior reasoning capability does not inherently ensure safety; for instance, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, one of the most capable models evaluated, exhibits the highest violation rate at over 60%, frequently escalating to severe misconduct to satisfy KPIs. Furthermore, we observe significant "deliberative misalignment", where the models that power the agents recognize their actions as unethical during separate evaluation. These results emphasize the critical need for more realistic agentic-safety training before deployment to mitigate their risks in the real world.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdvGame, a novel method for aligning language models (LMs)' safety with utility, using competing Attacker and Defender models trained via online reinforcement learning to iteratively improve.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current challenge is to ensure the safety of language models without compromising their usefulness, as existing adversarial training methods have limitations.

Method: The authors propose a game-theoretic framework with an Attacker and a Defender LM, jointly trained using online reinforcement learning with preference-based rewards to drive mutual improvement.

Result: The AdvGame approach achieves better safety and utility, with a Defender LM that is more helpful and resilient, and an Attacker LM suitable for probing other models.

Conclusion: This new method enhances safety alignment for LMs and provides tools for robust adversarial testing, advancing AI alignment strategies.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of language models (LMs) while maintaining their usefulness remains a critical challenge in AI alignment. Current approaches rely on sequential adversarial training: generating adversarial prompts and fine-tuning LMs to defend against them. We introduce a different paradigm: framing safety alignment as a non-zero-sum game between an Attacker LM and a Defender LM trained jointly via online reinforcement learning. Each LM continuously adapts to the other's evolving strategies, driving iterative improvement. Our method uses a preference-based reward signal derived from pairwise comparisons instead of point-wise scores, providing more robust supervision and potentially reducing reward hacking. Our RL recipe, AdvGame, shifts the Pareto frontier of safety and utility, yielding a Defender LM that is simultaneously more helpful and more resilient to adversarial attacks. In addition, the resulting Attacker LM converges into a strong, general-purpose red-teaming agent that can be directly deployed to probe arbitrary target models.

### [21] [Context-Sensitive Abstractions for Reinforcement Learning with Parameterized Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20831)
*Rashmeet Kaur Nayyar,Naman Shah,Siddharth Srivastava*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper develops reinforcement learning algorithms to address decision-making challenges in parameterized action spaces involving discrete and continuous actions, improving sample efficiency in sparse-reward settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for sequential decision-making struggle with parameterized action spaces combining discrete and continuous decisions, often requiring domain-specific engineering and lacking utilization of the latent action space structure.

Method: The paper proposes RL algorithms that autonomously learn and refine both state and action abstractions during online learning, focusing on critical regions where detailed resolution enhances performance.

Result: The proposed abstraction-driven approach enables TD(λ) to achieve significantly improved sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods across various parameterized-action domains.

Conclusion: Autonomous abstraction refinement allows RL algorithms to handle sparse-reward, long-horizon problems in parameterized action spaces effectively, demonstrating improved performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Real-world sequential decision-making often involves parameterized action spaces that require both, decisions regarding discrete actions and decisions about continuous action parameters governing how an action is executed. Existing approaches exhibit severe limitations in this setting -- planning methods demand hand-crafted action models, and standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed for either discrete or continuous actions but not both, and the few RL methods that handle parameterized actions typically rely on domain-specific engineering and fail to exploit the latent structure of these spaces. This paper extends the scope of RL algorithms to long-horizon, sparse-reward settings with parameterized actions by enabling agents to autonomously learn both state and action abstractions online. We introduce algorithms that progressively refine these abstractions during learning, increasing fine-grained detail in the critical regions of the state-action space where greater resolution improves performance. Across several continuous-state, parameterized-action domains, our abstraction-driven approach enables TD($λ$) to achieve markedly higher sample efficiency than state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of reasoning errors in LLMs caused by repetitive self-reflections and proposes a multi-agent, multi-persona debating approach to improve diversity and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem of performance degeneration in reasoning tasks caused by LLMs repeatedly making the same errors during self-reflection.

Method: The authors utilized multi-agent systems with multi-persona debaters to generate diverse reflections, instead of relying on the continual self-reflections of a single LLM.

Result: The multi-agent system improved the LLM's reasoning abilities, achieving 47% accuracy on EM HotPot QA and 82.7% on HumanEval, both outperforming single LLM reflections.

Conclusion: Incorporating multi-agent and multi-persona approaches enhances the diversity and accuracy of LLM reflections, leading to improved reasoning performance.

Abstract: LLMs have shown the capacity to improve their performance on reasoning tasks through reflecting on their mistakes, and acting with these reflections in mind. However, continual reflections of the same LLM onto itself exhibit degeneration of thought, where the LLM continues to repeat the same errors again and again even with the knowledge that its wrong. To address this problem, we instead introduce multi-agent with multi-persona debators as the method to generate reflections. Through out extensive experimentation, we've found that the leads to better diversity of in the reflections generated by the llm agent. We demonstrate an accuracy of 47% EM HotPot QA (question answering) and 82.7% on HumanEval (programming), both performances surpassing reflection with a single llm.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a probabilistic framework for autonomous agents to engage in bidirectional knowledge exchange, overcoming limitations of epistemic asymmetry, using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution and forgetting factor for uncertainty handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of unidirectional information consumption in autonomous agents, which results in redundant reasoning and stagnation of collective intelligence.

Method: A formal probabilistic framework based on Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor to quantify epistemic uncertainty and optimize knowledge exchange and learning.

Result: Demonstrates how uncertainty-driven strategies outperform random baselines in dynamic environments and offers scalable techniques like epistemic caching to prioritize resources adaptively.

Conclusion: The framework enables agents to reduce uncertainty through interaction, introduces new methods for RLHF and SFT, and fosters adaptability and data-sharing efficiency in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are proficient consumers of digital content but remain unidirectional, a limitation we term epistemic asymmetry. This isolation leads to redundant reasoning and stagnates collective intelligence. Current self-reflection frameworks remain largely heuristic and private, lacking a probabilistic foundation to quantify certainty or justify external interaction.To bridge this gap, we propose a formal probabilistic framework that provides agents with a non-altruistic motive for bidirectional knowledge exchange. We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($γ$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $γ$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\mathbb{E}[θ]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how these accumulated belief states serve as verifiable reward signals for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and high-quality data filters for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Simulation results validate that this uncertainty-driven strategy significantly outperforms random baselines in heterogeneous (Zipfian) environments, maintaining high adaptability to concept drift.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework combining a LangChain-based multi-agent system and permissioned blockchain to ensure trust, oversight, and security in agentic AI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The emergence of agentic AI systems in critical areas demands mechanisms to address issues of trust, oversight, and data integrity.

Method: A LangChain-based multi-agent system integrated with a permissioned blockchain, specifically Hyperledger Fabric, ensures secure monitoring, policy control, and traceability.

Result: Experiments in real-world scenarios like smart inventory, traffic control, and healthcare monitoring show effective prevention of unauthorized activities, traceability, and acceptable latency.

Conclusion: The framework offers a universal solution for secure and responsible deployment of autonomous agentic AI systems in critical applications.

Abstract: The application of agentic AI systems in autonomous decision-making is growing in the areas of healthcare, smart cities, digital forensics, and supply chain management. Even though these systems are flexible and offer real-time reasoning, they also raise concerns of trust and oversight, and integrity of the information and activities upon which they are founded. The paper suggests a single architecture model comprising of LangChain-based multi-agent system with a permissioned blockchain to guarantee constant monitoring, policy enforcement, and immutable auditability of agentic action. The framework relates the perception conceptualization-action cycle to a blockchain layer of governance that verifies the inputs, evaluates recommended actions, and documents the outcomes of the execution. A Hyperledger Fabric-based system, action executors MCP-integrated, and LangChain agent are introduced and experiments of smart inventory management, traffic-signal control, and healthcare monitoring are done. The results suggest that blockchain-security verification is efficient in preventing unauthorized practices, offers traceability throughout the whole decision-making process, and maintains operational latency within reasonable ranges. The suggested framework provides a universal system of implementing high-impact agentic AI applications that are autonomous yet responsible.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a modular AI system to create affordable and nutritionally adequate meal plans that adapt to food price fluctuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a system addressing fluctuating food prices while considering limited budgets and nutritional demands, especially in middle-income settings.

Method: A modular multi-agent architecture combining budgeting, nutrition, price monitoring, and health personalization to dynamically generate optimized meal plans.

Result: Simulations showed a 12-18% cost reduction, over 95% nutrient adequacy, and high adaptability to price changes up to 30%.

Conclusion: The system effectively offers a sustainable approach to balancing affordability and nutrition, supporting goals of zero hunger and good health globally.

Abstract: The issue of limited household budgets and nutritional demands continues to be a challenge especially in the middle-income environment where food prices fluctuate. This paper introduces a price aware agentic AI system, which combines personal finance management with diet optimization. With household income and fixed expenditures, medical and well-being status, as well as real-time food costs, the system creates nutritionally sufficient meals plans at comparatively reasonable prices that automatically adjust to market changes. The framework is implemented in a modular multi-agent architecture, which has specific agents (budgeting, nutrition, price monitoring, and health personalization). These agents share the knowledge base and use the substitution graph to ensure that the nutritional quality is maintained at a minimum cost. Simulations with a representative Saudi household case study show a steady 12-18\% reduction in costs relative to a static weekly menu, nutrient adequacy of over 95\% and high performance with price changes of 20-30%. The findings indicate that the framework can locally combine affordability with nutritional adequacy and provide a viable avenue of capacity-building towards sustainable and fair diet planning in line with Sustainable Development Goals on Zero Hunger and Good Health.

TL;DR: This paper introduces TrafficSimAgent, a framework utilizing LLMs to simplify traffic simulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are difficulties for users with limited knowledge of existing traffic simulation platforms when conducting experiments.

Method: TrafficSimAgent leverages LLM-based agents for experiment design and decision optimization in traffic simulation, employing high and low-level expert agents for flexible execution.

Result: Experiments demonstrate effectiveness in handling ambiguous instructions and outperforming other systems.

Conclusion: TrafficSimAgent simplifies traffic simulations, enhances usability, and exceeds current methods in performance.

Abstract: Traffic simulation is important for transportation optimization and policy making. While existing simulators such as SUMO and MATSim offer fully-featured platforms and utilities, users without too much knowledge about these platforms often face significant challenges when conducting experiments from scratch and applying them to their daily work. To solve this challenge, we propose TrafficSimAgent, an LLM-based agent framework that serves as an expert in experiment design and decision optimization for general-purpose traffic simulation tasks. The framework facilitates execution through cross-level collaboration among expert agents: high-level expert agents comprehend natural language instructions with high flexibility, plan the overall experiment workflow, and invoke corresponding MCP-compatible tools on demand; meanwhile, low-level expert agents select optimal action plans for fundamental elements based on real-time traffic conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple scenarios show that TrafficSimAgent effectively executes simulations under various conditions and consistently produces reasonable outcomes even when user instructions are ambiguous. Besides, the carefully designed expert-level autonomous decision-driven optimization in TrafficSimAgent yields superior performance when compared with other systems and SOTA LLM based methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study develops an Agentic XAI framework combining SHAP explainability with iterative refinement by LLMs to improve AI explanations, applied to agricultural recommendations. Human and AI evaluations show improved recommendation quality, but excessive refinement harms performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of communicating AI outputs (specifically XAI findings) to non-experts, improving trust in AI while exploring the potential of autonomous LLMs in translating technical outputs into accessible forms.

Method: The framework integrates SHAP-based explainability with LLM-driven refinement, improving explanations iteratively. Tested on rice yield data, iterative refinement across 11 rounds evaluated explanations on clarity, relevance, and practical metrics through human and AI reviewers.

Result: The approach led to a 30-33% quality improvement in AI explanations by early refinement rounds (peaking at Rounds 3-4), but over-refinement caused quality drops due to verbosity and abstraction, emphasizing a trade-off between depth and clarity.

Conclusion: Optimal refinement requires strategic early stopping for balanced, practical utility in agentic XAI systems. The study provides principles on the trade-off between improvement iterations and potential over-complication, promoting balanced refinement in explanation systems.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) enables data-driven understanding of factor associations with response variables, yet communicating XAI outputs to laypersons remains challenging, hindering trust in AI-based predictions. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored. This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis. These findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed for optimizing practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents 'RoboSafe,' a runtime safeguard to enhance the safety of embodied agents in complex, dynamic environments by reducing hazardous actions while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the vulnerability of vision-language model-empowered embodied agents to hazardous instructions, especially in dynamic, context-rich environments where current static rule-based or prompt-level safety mechanisms fall short.

Method: RoboSafe is introduced as a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard using executable predicate-based safety logic. It combines Backward Reflective Reasoning (inferring risks from short-term temporal safety predicates) and Forward Predictive Reasoning (anticipating risks based on long-term memories and multimodal observations) to form an adaptive and interpretable safety framework.

Result: The proposed approach reduces hazardous actions by 36.8% compared to leading baselines and maintains near-original task performance. Real-world tests with physical robotics validate its practicality.

Conclusion: RoboSafe demonstrates a significant improvement in runtime safety for embodied agents, offering an adaptive, verifiable, and interpretable solution suitable for real-world dynamic environments and robotics applications.

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly capable of executing complex real-world tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to hazardous instructions that may trigger unsafe behaviors. Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality. Code will be released upon acceptance.

### [29] [LLM Personas as a Substitute for Field Experiments in Method Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21080)
*Enoch Hyunwook Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores using LLM-based persona simulations as a cost-effective alternative to field experiments for adaptive methods, proving conditions under which they are valid and providing guidelines for their effective use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Field experiments are often expensive and slow, creating challenges for iterative method development. This paper seeks to address whether LLM-based persona simulations can serve as a realistic and cost-efficient alternative.

Method: The paper provides a theoretical analysis proving conditions under which persona simulations are equivalent to field experiments. It also introduces an information-theoretic approach to measure the discriminability of the simulated results and provides explicit sample size guidelines.

Result: The study establishes criteria for validity (aggregate-only observation and algorithm-blind evaluation) and shows that the effectiveness of persona benchmarking depends on the number of independent simulations conducted.

Conclusion: Replacing humans with persona simulations in evaluations is feasible under certain conditions and scales with sample size to achieve reliable benchmarking for adaptive methods.

Abstract: Field experiments (A/B tests) are often the most credible benchmark for methods in societal systems, but their cost and latency create a major bottleneck for iterative method development. LLM-based persona simulation offers a cheap synthetic alternative, yet it is unclear whether replacing humans with personas preserves the benchmark interface that adaptive methods optimize against. We prove an if-and-only-if characterization: when (i) methods observe only the aggregate outcome (aggregate-only observation) and (ii) evaluation depends only on the submitted artifact and not on the algorithm's identity or provenance (algorithm-blind evaluation), swapping humans for personas is just panel change from the method's point of view, indistinguishable from changing the evaluation population (e.g., New York to Jakarta). Furthermore, we move from validity to usefulness: we define an information-theoretic discriminability of the induced aggregate channel and show that making persona benchmarking as decision-relevant as a field experiment is fundamentally a sample-size question, yielding explicit bounds on the number of independent persona evaluations required to reliably distinguish meaningfully different methods at a chosen resolution.

Motivation: The study aims to address overlooked vulnerabilities in LLMs, specifically their inability to grasp user intent and context in malicious interactions, which can lead to exploitation of safety mechanisms.

Method: The authors empirically analyzed state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek, using techniques like emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification to bypass safety mechanisms.

Result: The analysis uncovered systematic vulnerabilities in most LLMs, with reasoning-enabled configurations worsening exploitability. However, Claude Opus 4.1 showed better performance by prioritizing intent recognition in certain situations.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for a fundamental shift in LLM design, emphasizing the need for contextual understanding and intent recognition as inherent safety features instead of relying on reactive, post-hoc mechanisms.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) safety approaches focus on explicitly harmful content while overlooking a critical vulnerability: the inability to understand context and recognize user intent. This creates exploitable vulnerabilities that malicious users can systematically leverage to circumvent safety mechanisms. We empirically evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our analysis demonstrates the circumvention of reliable safety mechanisms through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques. Notably, reasoning-enabled configurations amplified rather than mitigated the effectiveness of exploitation, increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate the underlying intent. The exception was Claude Opus 4.1, which prioritized intent detection over information provision in some use cases. This pattern reveals that current architectural designs create systematic vulnerabilities. These limitations require paradigmatic shifts toward contextual understanding and intent recognition as core safety capabilities rather than post-hoc protective mechanisms.

### [31] [A Real-World Evaluation of LLM Medication Safety Reviews in NHS Primary Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21127)
*Oliver Normand,Esther Borsi,Mitch Fruin,Lauren E Walker,Jamie Heagerty,Chris C. Holmes,Anthony J Avery,Iain E Buchan,Harry Coppock*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates a large language model (LLM)-based medication safety review system on NHS primary care data, identifying key weaknesses like contextual reasoning failures that must be addressed before safe deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to evaluate the real-world application of LLMs in a critical domain (medication safety in clinical care) and understand their performance and limitations in handling clinically complex data.

Method: A retrospective study was conducted on patient data from NHS Cheshire and Merseyside, involving 277 patients after exclusions. Expert clinicians reviewed system-identified issues and proposed interventions to analyze the LLM's performance.

Result: The LLM demonstrated high sensitivity (100%) in identifying the presence of clinical issues but low accuracy (46.9%) in correctly recognizing all issues and providing appropriate interventions. Failures were attributed to contextual reasoning issues such as overconfidence, misapplication of guidelines, and misunderstanding of healthcare delivery.

Conclusion: This paper underscores the critical challenges of deploying LLMs in clinical settings. LLMs require improved contextual reasoning, larger-scale evaluations, and deeper insights into their behavior before safe real-world application.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often match or exceed clinician-level performance on medical benchmarks, yet very few are evaluated on real clinical data or examined beyond headline metrics. We present, to our knowledge, the first evaluation of an LLM-based medication safety review system on real NHS primary care data, with detailed characterisation of key failure behaviours across varying levels of clinical complexity. In a retrospective study using a population-scale EHR spanning 2,125,549 adults in NHS Cheshire and Merseyside, we strategically sampled patients to capture a broad range of clinical complexity and medication safety risk, yielding 277 patients after data-quality exclusions. An expert clinician reviewed these patients and graded system-identified issues and proposed interventions. Our primary LLM system showed strong performance in recognising when a clinical issue is present (sensitivity 100\% [95\% CI 98.2--100], specificity 83.1\% [95\% CI 72.7--90.1]), yet correctly identified all issues and interventions in only 46.9\% [95\% CI 41.1--52.8] of patients. Failure analysis reveals that, in this setting, the dominant failure mechanism is contextual reasoning rather than missing medication knowledge, with five primary patterns: overconfidence in uncertainty, applying standard guidelines without adjusting for patient context, misunderstanding how healthcare is delivered in practice, factual errors, and process blindness. These patterns persisted across patient complexity and demographic strata, and across a range of state-of-the-art models and configurations. We provide 45 detailed vignettes that comprehensively cover all identified failure cases. This work highlights shortcomings that must be addressed before LLM-based clinical AI can be safely deployed. It also begs larger-scale, prospective evaluations and deeper study of LLM behaviours in clinical contexts.

Method: The authors introduce NotSoTiny, a benchmark based on hundreds of real hardware designs. It employs an automated pipeline to remove duplicates, verify correctness, and update the designs to avoid data contamination in line with Tiny Tapeout's release schedule.

Result: The evaluation indicates that NotSoTiny tasks are more challenging and effective than existing benchmarks, showcasing its potential in assessing advanced RTL generation by LLMs.

Conclusion: NotSoTiny successfully addresses limitations of RTL benchmarks, offering a more robust tool for evaluating and improving LLM capabilities in hardware design.

Abstract: LLMs have shown early promise in generating RTL code, yet evaluating their capabilities in realistic setups remains a challenge. So far, RTL benchmarks have been limited in scale, skewed toward trivial designs, offering minimal verification rigor, and remaining vulnerable to data contamination. To overcome these limitations and to push the field forward, this paper introduces NotSoTiny, a benchmark that assesses LLM on the generation of structurally rich and context-aware RTL. Built from hundreds of actual hardware designs produced by the Tiny Tapeout community, our automated pipeline removes duplicates, verifies correctness and periodically incorporates new designs to mitigate contamination, matching Tiny Tapeout release schedule. Evaluation results show that NotSoTiny tasks are more challenging than prior benchmarks, emphasizing its effectiveness in overcoming current limitations of LLMs applied to hardware design, and in guiding the improvement of such promising technology.

### [34] [Uncovering Competency Gaps in Large Language Models and Their Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20638)
*Matyas Bohacek,Nino Scherrer,Nicholas Dufour,Thomas Leung,Christoph Bregler,Stephanie C. Y. Chan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies gaps in the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) caused by inherent weaknesses in the models and biases in benchmarks. It proposes a method using sparse autoencoders to uncover these gaps and highlights areas for improvement in both LLMs and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation benchmarks for LLMs often obscure specific areas where these models are weak or where the benchmarks themselves have imbalanced coverage. The authors aim to uncover these hidden issues and improve understanding of LLM performance.

Method: The authors propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to uncover model and benchmark gaps. By analyzing SAE concept activations and computing saliency-weighted performance scores, their method evaluates LLMs based on internal representations and enables detailed comparisons.

Result: The method revealed that the evaluated models struggled with concepts related to refuting sycophantic behavior, safety, and asserting boundaries while benchmarks themselves overly focused on obedience and instruction-following. These findings align with prior research, uncovered without manual supervision.

Conclusion: This representation-grounded evaluation complements conventional metrics by offering concept-level insights into LLM performance and benchmark coverage. The approach helps in understanding gaps and how benchmarks can better reflect their intended capabilities.

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) relies heavily on standardized benchmarks. These benchmarks provide useful aggregated metrics for a given capability, but those aggregated metrics can obscure (i) particular sub-areas where the LLMs are weak ("model gaps") and (ii) imbalanced coverage in the benchmarks themselves ("benchmark gaps"). We propose a new method that uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to automatically uncover both types of gaps. By extracting SAE concept activations and computing saliency-weighted performance scores across benchmark data, the method grounds evaluation in the model's internal representations and enables comparison across benchmarks. As examples demonstrating our approach, we applied the method to two popular open-source models and ten benchmarks. We found that these models consistently underperformed on concepts that stand in contrast to sycophantic behaviors (e.g., politely refusing a request or asserting boundaries) and concepts connected to safety discussions. These model gaps align with observations previously surfaced in the literature; our automated, unsupervised method was able to recover them without manual supervision. We also observed benchmark gaps: many of the evaluated benchmarks over-represented concepts related to obedience, authority, or instruction-following, while missing core concepts that should fall within their intended scope. In sum, our method offers a representation-grounded approach to evaluation, enabling concept-level decomposition of benchmark scores. Rather than replacing conventional aggregated metrics, CG complements them by providing a concept-level decomposition that can reveal why a model scored as it did and how benchmarks could evolve to better reflect their intended scope.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SA-DiffuSeq improves diffusion-based text generation methods through sparse attention to optimize scalability and efficiency for long documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods face challenges in computational and memory efficiency for long sequence text generation.

Method: SA-DiffuSeq integrates sparse attention combined with a tailored soft absorbing state to stabilize diffusion trajectories and enhance modeling precision for extended sequences.

Result: Experiments show SA-DiffuSeq outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion baselines in training efficiency and sampling speed, excelling particularly in long sequence tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating structured sparsity into diffusion models is effective for scalable and high-quality long text generation applications.

Abstract: Diffusion based approaches to long form text generation suffer from prohibitive computational cost and memory overhead as sequence length increases. We introduce SA-DiffuSeq, a diffusion framework that integrates sparse attention to fundamentally improve scalability for long document modeling. By selectively allocating attention within the diffusion process, SA-DiffuSeq significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining semantic coherence and generation quality. A key component of our method is a soft absorbing state tailored to sparse attention dynamics, which stabilizes diffusion trajectories and accelerates sequence reconstruction. This design improves sampling efficiency and enhances precision in long range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA-DiffuSeq consistently surpasses state of the art diffusion baselines in both training efficiency and sampling speed, with especially strong gains on extended sequences. These properties make SA-DiffuSeq well suited for demanding long form applications such as scientific writing, large scale code generation, and multi turn long context dialogue. Overall, our results indicate that incorporating structured sparsity into diffusion models is a promising direction for efficient and expressive long text generation.

*Gül Sena Altıntaş,Malikeh Ehghaghi,Brian Lester,Fengyuan Liu,Wanru Zhao,Marco Ciccone,Colin Raffel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces TokSuite, a framework to analyze tokenization's impact on language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to clarify the role of tokenization in language model performance, which is insufficiently studied due to difficulty in isolation measurements.

Method: Authors train 14 identical language models with varying tokenizers, using controlled datasets and benchmarks to assess impact of tokenization on real-world tasks.

Result: This research revealed distinct strengths and weaknesses of popular tokenizers, while allowing robust analysis.

Conclusion: TokSuite provides tools to isolate and understand tokenization's effects on language models, enabling informed research and development.

Abstract: Tokenizers provide the fundamental basis through which text is represented and processed by language models (LMs). Despite the importance of tokenization, its role in LM performance and behavior is poorly understood due to the challenge of measuring the impact of tokenization in isolation. To address this need, we present TokSuite, a collection of models and a benchmark that supports research into tokenization's influence on LMs. Specifically, we train fourteen models that use different tokenizers but are otherwise identical using the same architecture, dataset, training budget, and initialization. Additionally, we curate and release a new benchmark that specifically measures model performance subject to real-world perturbations that are likely to influence tokenization. Together, TokSuite allows robust decoupling of the influence of a model's tokenizer, supporting a series of novel findings that elucidate the respective benefits and shortcomings of a wide range of popular tokenizers.

*Ziyi Zhu,Olivier Tieleman,Caitlin A. Stamatis,Luka Smyth,Thomas D. Hull,Daniel R. Cahn,Matteo Malgaroli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adversarial training framework to improve the realism of user simulators for task-oriented dialogue systems, particularly in mental health domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to train and evaluate task-oriented dialogue systems using realistic user simulations and expose system failure modes reliably while mimicking human behavior.

Method: An adversarial setup is used with a generator (user simulator) and a discriminator interacting iteratively to enhance realism, alignment, and diversity in simulating user behavior.

Result: Fine-tuned simulators outperform base models in identifying system flaws, and adversarial training further improves distributional alignment and prediction accuracy. Simulators exhibit strong correlation with real failure rates across chatbot configurations.

Conclusion: Adversarial training presents a promising methodology for developing realistic, robust user simulators, enabling effective pre-deployment evaluation in task-oriented dialogue systems, particularly in mental health support contexts.

Abstract: Realistic user simulation is crucial for training and evaluating task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, yet creating simulators that accurately replicate human behavior remains challenging. A key property of effective simulators is their ability to expose failure modes of the systems they evaluate. We present an adversarial training framework that iteratively improves user simulator realism through a competitive dynamic between a generator (user simulator) and a discriminator. Applied to mental health support chatbots, our approach demonstrates that fine-tuned simulators dramatically outperform zero-shot base models at surfacing system issues, and adversarial training further enhances diversity, distributional alignment, and predictive validity. The resulting simulator achieves a strong correlation between simulated and real failure occurrence rates across diverse chatbot configurations while maintaining low distributional divergence of failure modes. Discriminator accuracy decreases drastically after three adversarial iterations, suggesting improved realism. These results provide evidence that adversarial training is a promising approach for creating realistic user simulators in mental health support TOD domains, enabling rapid, reliable, and cost-effective system evaluation before deployment.

### [38] [Large Language Models Approach Expert Pedagogical Quality in Math Tutoring but Differ in Instructional and Linguistic Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20780)
*Ramatu Oiza Abdulsalam,Segun Aroyehun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates how closely large language models (LLMs) align with expert human tutors in mathematics instruction, finding LLMs approach expert quality but differ in strategies and language use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to evaluate whether large language models can replicate the instructional behavior and effectiveness of expert human tutors in mathematics, addressing a gap in understanding their alignment with professional tutoring strategies.

Method: A turn-level comparison was conducted, where expert human tutors, novice tutors, and several large language models responded to identical math tutoring scenarios. Various instructional strategies and linguistic features (like readability, politeness, and strategy use) were analyzed and compared.

Result: The study found that LLMs generally reach expert levels of perceived pedagogical quality but differ from human tutors by underusing certain strategies (e.g., restating and revoicing) and overusing others (e.g., politeness). Statistical analyses revealed that specific characteristics positively or negatively impacted perceived pedagogical quality.

Conclusion: Large language models display pedagogical quality comparable to expert tutors but rely on different techniques. This highlights the importance of analyzing strategies and language patterns to better align intelligent tutoring systems with expert teaching practices.

Abstract: Recent work has explored the use of large language models for generating tutoring responses in mathematics, yet it remains unclear how closely their instructional behavior aligns with expert human practice. We examine this question using a controlled, turn-level comparison in which expert human tutors, novice human tutors, and multiple large language models respond to the same set of math remediation conversation turns. We examine both instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics of tutoring responses, including restating and revoicing, pressing for accuracy, lexical diversity, readability, politeness, and agency. We find that large language models approach expert levels of perceived pedagogical quality on average but exhibit systematic differences in their instructional and linguistic profiles. In particular, large language models tend to underuse restating and revoicing strategies characteristic of expert human tutors, while producing longer, more lexically diverse, and more polite responses. Statistical analyses show that restating and revoicing, lexical diversity, and pressing for accuracy are positively associated with perceived pedagogical quality, whereas higher levels of agentic and polite language are negatively associated. Overall, recent large language models exhibit levels of perceived pedagogical quality comparable to expert human tutors, while relying on different instructional and linguistic strategies. These findings underscore the value of analyzing instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics when evaluating tutoring responses across human tutors and intelligent tutoring systems.

*Shariqah Hossain,Lalana Kagal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how model editing algorithms can improve machine unlearning, showing better performance than traditional methods in certain cases but also highlighting limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and performance degradation in current machine unlearning methods, especially for large language models.

Method: Investigating and adapting model editing algorithms (ROME, IKE, WISE) for unlearning purposes, introducing new editing targets.

Result: Model editing approaches can surpass baseline unlearning methods depending on the setting, but both approaches face challenges in fully unlearning information without affecting overall performance.

Conclusion: Model editing techniques show promise for machine unlearning but require further refinement to balance forgetting specificity with overall model stability.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove unwanted information from a model, but many methods are inefficient for LLMs with large numbers of parameters or fail to fully remove the intended information without degrading performance on knowledge that should be retained. Model editing algorithms solve a similar problem of changing information in models, but they focus on redirecting inputs to a new target rather than removing that information altogether. In this work, we explore the editing algorithms ROME, IKE, and WISE and design new editing targets for an unlearning setting. Through this investigation, we show that model editing approaches can exceed baseline unlearning methods in terms of quality of forgetting depending on the setting. Like traditional unlearning techniques, they struggle to encapsulate the scope of what is to be unlearned without damage to the overall model performance.

### [40] [Measuring Mechanistic Independence: Can Bias Be Removed Without Erasing Demographics?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20796)
*Zhengyang Shan,Aaron Mueller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines whether AI language models can be debiased while still preserving their ability to detect demographic attributes, using a multi-task evaluation setup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models often exhibit demographic biases, which can lead to harmful stereotypes and ethical concerns. This paper aims to separate demographic bias from demographic recognition capabilities and propose methods to address bias while retaining useful functionalities.

Method: Using Gemma-2-9B, sparse autoencoder feature ablations were applied with attribution-based and correlation-based methods to measure and mitigate bias in demographic-related tasks.

Result: Attribution-based ablations successfully mitigated race and gender biases while preserving name recognition, while correlation-based ablations were better suited to address education biases. However, removing attribution features in education tasks inadvertently increased bias due to 'prior collapse.'

Conclusion: Demographic bias stems from task-specific methods rather than inherent demographic markers, and inference-time interventions specific to task dimensions can effectively debias models without reducing their overall demographic recognition capabilities.

Abstract: We investigate how independent demographic bias mechanisms are from general demographic recognition in language models. Using a multi-task evaluation setup where demographics are associated with names, professions, and education levels, we measure whether models can be debiased while preserving demographic detection capabilities. We compare attribution-based and correlation-based methods for locating bias features. We find that targeted sparse autoencoder feature ablations in Gemma-2-9B reduce bias without degrading recognition performance: attribution-based ablations mitigate race and gender profession stereotypes while preserving name recognition accuracy, whereas correlation-based ablations are more effective for education bias. Qualitative analysis further reveals that removing attribution features in education tasks induces ``prior collapse'', thus increasing overall bias. This highlights the need for dimension-specific interventions. Overall, our results show that demographic bias arises from task-specific mechanisms rather than absolute demographic markers, and that mechanistic inference-time interventions can enable surgical debiasing without compromising core model capabilities.

*Nathaniël de Leeuw,Marceau Nahon,Mathis Reymond,Raja Chatila,Mehdi Khamassi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the symbolic reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing semantic deceptions to test their abstraction and manipulation of unfamiliar symbols. Results show these models struggle with symbolic tasks when misled by semantic associations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities when exposed to novel and deceptive symbolic representations, particularly concerning their reliance on semantic associations.

Method: The authors created experiments using novel symbolic representations for digits and operators and introduced semantic deceptions to test LLMs' abilities for abstraction and resistance to misleading semantic cues. Four LLMs were tested.

Result: The experiments revealed that LLMs often fail at symbolic manipulations when semantic deceptions are introduced, showing a reliance on surface-level semantics. Even with instructions, residual semantic effects impair performance.

Conclusion: LLMs have significant limitations in their symbolic reasoning capabilities, highlighting their over-reliance on semantic associations. These findings caution against assuming reasoning abilities in LLMs, particularly in critical decision-making contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in situations where human values are at stake, such as decision-making tasks that involve reasoning when performed by humans. We investigate the so-called reasoning capabilities of LLMs over novel symbolic representations by introducing an experimental framework that tests their ability to process and manipulate unfamiliar symbols. We introduce semantic deceptions: situations in which symbols carry misleading semantic associations due to their form, such as being embedded in specific contexts, designed to probe whether LLMs can maintain symbolic abstraction or whether they default to exploiting learned semantic associations. We redefine standard digits and mathematical operators using novel symbols, and task LLMs with solving simple calculations expressed in this altered notation. The objective is: (1) to assess LLMs' capacity for abstraction and manipulation of arbitrary symbol systems; (2) to evaluate their ability to resist misleading semantic cues that conflict with the task's symbolic logic. Through experiments with four LLMs we show that semantic cues can significantly deteriorate reasoning models' performance on very simple tasks. They reveal limitations in current LLMs' ability for symbolic manipulations and highlight a tendency to over-rely on surface-level semantics, suggesting that chain-of-thoughts may amplify reliance on statistical correlations. Even in situations where LLMs seem to correctly follow instructions, semantic cues still impact basic capabilities. These limitations raise ethical and societal concerns, undermining the widespread and pernicious tendency to attribute reasoning abilities to LLMs and suggesting how LLMs might fail, in particular in decision-making contexts where robust symbolic reasoning is essential and should not be compromised by residual semantic associations inherited from the model's training.

TL;DR: This paper introduces EssayCBM, a transparent essay grading framework that evaluates writing via concept-level analysis rather than direct grading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in understanding how automated systems assess essays and provide an interpretable and accountable grading process.

Method: EssayCBM employs an encoder to predict scores for eight writing concepts related to essay quality, which are used as inputs for a lightweight network to determine a final grade.

Result: EssayCBM performs comparably to black-box models while providing detailed, actionable feedback on writing concepts via a user-friendly interface.

Conclusion: EssayCBM enhances grading transparency and empowers educators with the ability to interpret and adjust grades, promoting accountable assessment.

Abstract: Understanding how automated grading systems evaluate essays remains a significant challenge for educators and students, especially when large language models function as black boxes. We introduce EssayCBM, a rubric-aligned framework that prioritizes interpretability in essay assessment. Instead of predicting grades directly from text, EssayCBM evaluates eight writing concepts, such as Thesis Clarity and Evidence Use, through dedicated prediction heads on an encoder. These concept scores form a transparent bottleneck, and a lightweight network computes the final grade using only concepts. Instructors can adjust concept predictions and instantly view the updated grade, enabling accountable human-in-the-loop evaluation. EssayCBM matches black-box performance while offering actionable, concept-level feedback through an intuitive web interface.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MediEval, a benchmark for evaluating medical LLMs on knowledge grounding and contextual consistency using EHRs and a unified knowledge base. It also presents Counterfactual Risk-Aware Fine-tuning (CoRFu) for safer and more accurate LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs show limited adoption in medicine due to concerns about reliability and safety. Existing evaluations fail to provide a holistic assessment combining knowledge accuracy and contextual reasoning.

Method: The paper develops MediEval, which uses EHRs linked to a knowledge base for creating diverse medical statements. It also introduces CoRFu, a fine-tuning method to address unsafe confusions via an asymmetric penalty.

Result: Critical LLM failure modes, such as hallucinations and truth inversion, are identified. CoRFu achieves a +16.4 macro-F1 improvement and prevents truth inversion errors.

Conclusion: The proposed MediEval benchmark and CoRFu method enhance both the evaluation and safety of medical LLMs, addressing gaps in existing approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to medicine, yet their adoption is limited by concerns over reliability and safety. Existing evaluations either test factual medical knowledge in isolation or assess patient-level reasoning without verifying correctness, leaving a critical gap. We introduce MediEval, a benchmark that links MIMIC-IV electronic health records (EHRs) to a unified knowledge base built from UMLS and other biomedical vocabularies. MediEval generates diverse factual and counterfactual medical statements within real patient contexts, enabling systematic evaluation across a 4-quadrant framework that jointly considers knowledge grounding and contextual consistency. Using this framework, we identify critical failure modes, including hallucinated support and truth inversion, that current proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific LLMs frequently exhibit. To address these risks, we propose Counterfactual Risk-Aware Fine-tuning (CoRFu), a DPO-based method with an asymmetric penalty targeting unsafe confusions. CoRFu improves by +16.4 macro-F1 points over the base model and eliminates truth inversion errors, demonstrating both higher accuracy and substantially greater safety.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates existing retrieval quality metrics and introduces a new measure for handling unknown quantities of relevant documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the common issue in realistic retrieval systems where recall cannot be computed due to unknown total relevant documents.

Method: Experiments are conducted across multiple datasets with few relevant documents, correlating retrieval metrics with LLM-based response quality judgments, and proposing a new quality measure.

Result: The introduced measure performs effectively without needing the total number of relevant documents.

Conclusion: The novel retrieval quality measure provides a solution for unknown relevant document counts and shows reliable performance.

Abstract: In realistic retrieval settings with large and evolving knowledge bases, the total number of documents relevant to a query is typically unknown, and recall cannot be computed. In this paper, we evaluate several established strategies for handling this limitation by measuring the correlation between retrieval quality metrics and LLM-based judgments of response quality, where responses are generated from the retrieved documents. We conduct experiments across multiple datasets with a relatively low number of relevant documents (2-15). We also introduce a simple retrieval quality measure that performs well without requiring knowledge of the total number of relevant documents.

### [47] [Architectural Trade-offs in Small Language Models Under Compute Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20877)
*Shivraj Singh Bhatti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates optimal architectural choices for small language models under compute constraints, emphasizing trade-offs in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how architectural decisions and training budgets impact the performance and efficiency of small language models.

Method: Systematic construction of language models by sequentially adding elements like nonlinearities and self-attention, and benchmarking their performance on datasets such as Tiny Shakespeare, Penn Treebank (PTB), and WikiText-2.

Result: Attention-based models outperform MLPs in per-FLOP efficiency on small-scale setups. Increasing depth or context without sufficient tuning harms performance. Transfer of large model techniques (like RoPE) doesn't guarantee success in small models.

Conclusion: Optimizing small language models requires carefully balancing architectural choices and compute budgets, as blindly applying methods from large models may not work.

Abstract: We present a systematic empirical study of small language models under strict compute constraints, analyzing how architectural choices and training budget interact to determine performance. Starting from a linear next-token predictor, we progressively introduce nonlinearities, self-attention, and multi-layer transformer architectures, evaluating each on character-level modeling of Tiny Shakespeare and word-level modeling of Penn Treebank (PTB) and WikiText-2. We compare models using test negative log-likelihood (NLL), parameter count, and approximate training FLOPs to characterize accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our results show that attention-based models dominate MLPs in per-FLOP efficiency even at small scale, while increasing depth or context without sufficient optimization can degrade performance. We further examine rotary positional embeddings (RoPE), finding that architectural techniques successful in large language models do not necessarily transfer to small-model regimes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies reasoning distillation, analyzing the origins and performance of distilled models under test-time contexts, and introduces a novel framework for tracing and improving reasoning distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unclear generalization capability of reasoning distilled models, which may not consistently replicate teacher model behaviors in novel test-time contexts.

Method: The authors propose a cross-model Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing framework, which traces the origins of actions taken by the distilled model by comparing it with teacher and original student predictions. They further suggest a teacher-guided data selection method to improve distillation.

Result: The study demonstrates that distilled models produce actions originating from the teacher model at test time, explaining their performance. The proposed framework and data selection method improve distillation outcomes, validated across various teacher and student models.

Conclusion: The new framework highlights the importance of tracing action provenance in reasoning distillation, improving the field's understanding and effectiveness. It provides a principled basis for selecting training data and optimizing distillation models for better generalization.

Abstract: Reasoning distillation has attracted increasing attention. It typically leverages a large teacher model to generate reasoning paths, which are then used to fine-tune a student model so that it mimics the teacher's behavior in training contexts. However, previous approaches have lacked a detailed analysis of the origins of the distilled model's capabilities. It remains unclear whether the student can maintain consistent behaviors with the teacher in novel test-time contexts, or whether it regresses to its original output patterns, raising concerns about the generalization of distillation models. To analyse this question, we introduce a cross-model Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing framework. For each action (e.g., a sentence) produced by the distilled model, we obtain the predictive probabilities assigned by the teacher, the original student, and the distilled model under the same context. By comparing these probabilities, we classify each action into different categories. By systematically disentangling the provenance of each action, we experimentally demonstrate that, in test-time contexts, the distilled model can indeed generate teacher-originated actions, which correlate with and plausibly explain observed performance on distilled model. Building on this analysis, we further propose a teacher-guided data selection method. Unlike prior approach that rely on heuristics, our method directly compares teacher-student divergences on the training data, providing a principled selection criterion. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple representative teacher models and diverse student models. The results highlight the utility of our provenance-tracing framework and underscore its promise for reasoning distillation. We hope to share Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing and our insights into reasoning distillation with the community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces FEND, a multi-modal framework integrating speech and text for detecting Alzheimer's, depression, and autism spectrum disorder across multiple languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in multi-lingual generalization and the lack of a unified evaluation framework for detecting neuropsychiatric disorders using linguistic and acoustic biomarkers.

Method: The authors propose FEND, which leverages multi-modal fusion across 13 datasets in 5 languages to evaluate performance in detecting neuropsychiatric disorders.

Result: Multi-modal fusion performs well in detecting Alzheimer's and depression but struggles with ASD due to dataset variability. Modality imbalance and task/language heterogeneity affect performance.

Conclusion: FEND provides a unified, lifespan-inclusive framework for assessing neuropsychiatric disorders, offering benchmarks and insights to guide fair and reproducible research.

Abstract: Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are characterized by linguistic and acoustic abnormalities, offering potential biomarkers for early detection. Despite the promise of multi-modal approaches, challenges like multi-lingual generalization and the absence of a unified evaluation framework persist. To address these gaps, we propose FEND (Foundation model-based Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Disorders), a comprehensive multi-modal framework integrating speech and text modalities for detecting AD, depression, and ASD across the lifespan. Leveraging 13 multi-lingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, Greek, French, and Dutch, we systematically evaluate multi-modal fusion performance. Our results show that multi-modal fusion excels in AD and depression detection but underperforms in ASD due to dataset heterogeneity. We also identify modality imbalance as a prevalent issue, where multi-modal fusion fails to surpass the best mono-modal models. Cross-corpus experiments reveal robust performance in task- and language-consistent scenarios but noticeable degradation in multi-lingual and task-heterogeneous settings. By providing extensive benchmarks and a detailed analysis of performance-influencing factors, FEND advances the field of automated, lifespan-inclusive, and multi-lingual neuropsychiatric disorder assessment. We encourage researchers to adopt the FEND framework for fair comparisons and reproducible research.

### [50] [Neural Probe-Based Hallucination Detection for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20949)
*Shize Liang,Hongzhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural network-based framework using MLP probes for token-level hallucination detection in large language models (LLMs) and demonstrates superior performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of hallucination in large language models, as current detection methods either generate high-confidence errors or depend on inefficient retrieval systems.

Method: Leverages lightweight MLP probes for nonlinear modeling, incorporates a multi-objective joint loss for stable detection, and uses Bayesian optimization to determine optimal probe layer positions.

Result: MLP probes outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, recall, and low false-positive rates on datasets like LongFact, HealthBench, and TriviaQA.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a practical and efficient solution for hallucination detection, significantly improving accuracy and reliability in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) excel at text generation and knowledge question-answering tasks, but they are prone to generating hallucinated content, severely limiting their application in high-risk domains. Current hallucination detection methods based on uncertainty estimation and external knowledge retrieval suffer from the limitation that they still produce erroneous content at high confidence levels and rely heavily on retrieval efficiency and knowledge coverage. In contrast, probe methods that leverage the model's hidden-layer states offer real-time and lightweight advantages. However, traditional linear probes struggle to capture nonlinear structures in deep semantic spaces.To overcome these limitations, we propose a neural network-based framework for token-level hallucination detection. By freezing language model parameters, we employ lightweight MLP probes to perform nonlinear modeling of high-level hidden states. A multi-objective joint loss function is designed to enhance detection stability and semantic disambiguity. Additionally, we establish a layer position-probe performance response model, using Bayesian optimization to automatically search for optimal probe insertion layers and achieve superior training results.Experimental results on LongFact, HealthBench, and TriviaQA demonstrate that MLP probes significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, recall, and detection capability under low false-positive conditions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper extends Chain-of-Thought prompting to biological sequences like proteins and RNA by introducing reflection pretraining, enabling models to perform intermediate reasoning steps with auxiliary tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of applying CoT-style reasoning to non-natural language domains, such as protein and RNA language models, due to their restricted token spaces and expressiveness.

Method: The method involves defining the concept of language expressiveness and introducing reflection pretraining to extend token expressiveness and enable intermediate reasoning with auxiliary 'thinking tokens' in biological sequence models.

Result: Using reflection pretraining, the paper demonstrates both theoretically and experimentally the enhanced expressiveness and reasoning capacity of protein models, achieving self-correction and performance improvements over standard methods.

Conclusion: Reflection pretraining successfully adapts CoT-style reasoning to protein language models by overcoming expressiveness limitations, improving reasoning and problem-solving capabilities in biological sequences.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced task-solving capabilities in natural language processing with large language models. Unlike standard prompting, CoT encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps, non-answer tokens, that help guide the model toward more accurate final outputs. These intermediate steps enable more complex reasoning processes such as error correction, memory management, future planning, and self-reflection. However, applying CoT to non-natural language domains, such as protein and RNA language models, is not yet possible, primarily due to the limited expressiveness of their token spaces (e.g., amino acid tokens). In this work, we propose and define the concept of language expressiveness: the ability of a given language, using its tokens and grammar, to encode information. We show that the limited expressiveness of protein language severely restricts the applicability of CoT-style reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce reflection pretraining, for the first time in a biological sequence model, which enables the model to engage in intermediate reasoning through the generation of auxiliary "thinking tokens" beyond simple answer tokens. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our augmented token set significantly enhances biological language expressiveness, thereby improving the overall reasoning capacity of the model. Experimentally, our pretraining approach teaches protein models to self-correct and leads to substantial performance gains compared to standard pretraining.

Result: A dataset (MedMistake-All) featuring 3,390 faulty QA pairs was created, with 211 pairs validated by experts (MedMistake-Bench). Twelve advanced LLMs were evaluated, and GPT, Claude, and Grok models demonstrated strong performance.

Conclusion: The study offers a novel resource, MedMistake, which assists in systematically identifying and addressing LLM errors in clinical contexts, bolstering evaluation and development of safer AI models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated in clinical settings using multi-dimensional rubrics which quantify reasoning quality, safety, and patient-centeredness. Yet, replicating specific mistakes in other LLM models is not straightforward and often requires manual effort. We introduce MedMistake, an automatic pipeline that extracts mistakes LLMs make in patient-doctor conversations and converts them into a benchmark of single-shot QA pairs. Our pipeline (1) creates complex, conversational data between an LLM patient and LLM doctor, (2) runs an evaluation with a committee of 2 LLM judges across a variety of dimensions and (3) creates simplified single-shot QA scenarios from those mistakes. We release MedMistake-All, a dataset of 3,390 single-shot QA pairs where GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro are currently failing to answer correctly, as judged by two LLM judges. We used medical experts to validate a subset of 211/3390 questions (MedMistake-Bench), which we used to run a final evaluation of 12 frontier LLMs: Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek-Chat, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-5, GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Grok 4, Grok 4.1, Mistral Large. We found that GPT models, Claude and Grok obtained the best performance on MedMistake-Bench. We release both the doctor-validated benchmark (MedMistake-Bench), as well as the full dataset (MedMistake-All) at https://huggingface.co/datasets/TheLumos/MedicalMistakeBenchmark.

### [54] [Distilling the Essence: Efficient Reasoning Distillation via Sequence Truncation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21002)
*Wei-Rui Chen,Vignesh Kothapalli,Ata Fatahibaarzi,Hejian Sang,Shao Tang,Qingquan Song,Zhipeng Wang,Muhammad Abdul-Mageed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores distilling reasoning capabilities from a large language model (LLM) to a smaller student model, revealing selective focus on specific reasoning tokens reduces computational cost while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to minimize computational expense while distilling reasoning abilities from LLMs, especially in areas where lengthy reasoning sequences are involved.

Method: They examine the effects of supervising different token segments in reasoning distillation and propose selective distillation on chain-of-thought (CoT) tokens. Additionally, they introduce a truncation protocol to optimize computation-quality tradeoffs.

Result: Selective training on the first 50% of tokens retained 94% of the original performance on math benchmarks, while halving training time, memory usage, and FLOPs.

Conclusion: Early reasoning tokens are crucial for effective distillation, presenting a straightforward approach to achieve computation-quality tradeoffs in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Distilling the reasoning capabilities from a large language model (LLM) to a smaller student model often involves training on substantial amounts of reasoning data. However, distillation over lengthy sequences with prompt (P), chain-of-thought (CoT), and answer (A) segments makes the process computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate how the allocation of supervision across different segments (P, CoT, A) affects student performance. Our analysis shows that selective knowledge distillation over only the CoT tokens can be effective when the prompt and answer information is encompassed by it. Building on this insight, we establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs as a function of sequence length. We observe that training on only the first $50\%$ of tokens of every training sequence can retain, on average, $\approx94\%$ of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about $50\%$ each. These findings suggest that reasoning distillation benefits from prioritizing early reasoning tokens and provides a simple lever for computation-quality tradeoffs.

*Xiaofeng Shi,Qian Kou,Yuduo Li,Hua Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study introduces SFTKey, a two-stage fine-tuning process for improving accuracy in Large Language Models by focusing on both Chain-of-Thought reasoning and final answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance fine-tuning processes for LLMs to ensure accurate complex reasoning and balanced attention between lengthy reasoning components and concise, critical outputs like final answers.

Method: Propose a two-stage training process: standard supervised fine-tuning (for output format) followed by fine-tuning focused on the final, crucial answer portion.

Result: Extensive experiments show over 5% accuracy improvement using SFTKey compared to conventional fine-tuning, while maintaining proper format generation across benchmarks and model families.

Conclusion: SFTKey successfully balances reasoning sequence learning and answer optimization, marking progress in LLM fine-tuning strategies for better performance and evaluation outcomes.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) component has become significant for complex reasoning tasks. However, in conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), the model could allocate disproportionately more attention to CoT sequences with excessive length. This reduces focus on the much shorter but essential Key portion-the final answer, whose correctness directly determines task success and evaluation quality. To address this limitation, we propose SFTKey, a two-stage training scheme. In the first stage, conventional SFT is applied to ensure proper output format, while in the second stage, only the Key portion is fine-tuned to improve accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families demonstrate that SFTKey achieves an average accuracy improvement exceeding 5\% over conventional SFT, while preserving the ability to generate correct formats. Overall, this study advances LLM fine-tuning by explicitly balancing CoT learning with additional optimization on answer-relevant tokens.

### [56] [Semantic Refinement with LLMs for Graph Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21106)
*Safal Thapaliya,Zehong Wang,Jiazheng Li,Ziming Li,Yanfang Ye,Chuxu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAS, a framework that refines semantics using a feedback loop between a graph neural network and a large language model, achieving improved results on diverse graph datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph domains exhibit variability in their predictive signals, creating challenges for models with fixed inductive bias. Current approaches focus on adding inductive bias to models, which limits their generalizability across different graph types.

Method: The DAS framework incorporates a fixed graph neural network and a large language model in a feedback loop where the GNN guides LLM-based semantic refinement, which is then fed back into updating the graph learner.

Result: Experiments show DAS enhances performance in structure-dominated graphs and retains competitive results in semantics-rich graphs, validating its data-centric adaptation for heterogeneous graph domains.

Conclusion: The data-centric approach in DAS addresses structure-semantics heterogeneity effectively, showing a promising direction for graph representation learning.

Abstract: Graph-structured data exhibit substantial heterogeneity in where their predictive signals originate: in some domains, node-level semantics dominate, while in others, structural patterns play a central role. This structure-semantics heterogeneity implies that no graph learning model with a fixed inductive bias can generalize optimally across diverse graph domains. However, most existing methods address this challenge from the model side by incrementally injecting new inductive biases, which remains fundamentally limited given the open-ended diversity of real-world graphs. In this work, we take a data-centric perspective and treat node semantics as a task-adaptive variable. We propose a Data-Adaptive Semantic Refinement framework DAS for graph representation learning, which couples a fixed graph neural network (GNN) and a large language model (LLM) in a closed feedback loop. The GNN provides implicit supervisory signals to guide the semantic refinement of LLM, and the refined semantics are fed back to update the same graph learner. We evaluate our approach on both text-rich and text-free graphs. Results show consistent improvements on structure-dominated graphs while remaining competitive on semantics-rich graphs, demonstrating the effectiveness of data-centric semantic adaptation under structure-semantics heterogeneity.

*Eduard Stefan Dinuta,Iustin Sirbu,Traian Rebedea*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores enhancing safety classifiers for Large Language Models (LLMs) using semi-supervised learning techniques that utilize both labeled and unlabeled data, emphasizing task-specific augmentations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving robust safety for LLMs is increasingly critical given their expanding capacities, but current methods face challenges such as reliance on large-scale labeled data, susceptibility to labeling errors, and dependence on synthetic data.

Method: The authors propose employing semi-supervised learning techniques that integrate labeled and unlabeled data, along with task-specific augmentations, to enhance safety classifier performance for LLMs.

Result: The use of semi-supervised techniques and task-specific augmentations has been shown to yield significant improvements in addressing safety tasks in prompts and model responses.

Conclusion: Semi-supervised approaches, particularly those incorporating tailored augmentations, are effective in overcoming current limitations in safety training for LLMs, making safety classifiers more robust.

Abstract: Safety for Large Language Models (LLMs) has been an ongoing research focus since their emergence and is even more relevant nowadays with the increasing capacity of those models. Currently, there are several guardrails in place for all public LLMs and multiple proposed datasets for training safety classifiers. However, training these safety classifiers relies on large quantities of labeled data, which can be problematic to acquire, prone to labeling errors, or often include synthetic data. To address these issues, we suggest a different approach: utilizing semi-supervised learning techniques, which leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, to improve the performance on the safety task. We analyze the improvements that these techniques can offer for both prompts given to Large Language Models and the responses to those requests. Moreover, since augmentation is the central part of semi-supervised algorithms, we demonstrate the importance of using task-specific augmentations, which significantly increase the performance when compared to general-purpose augmentation techniques.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces ClarifyMT-Bench to evaluate LLMs' clarity in multi-turn dialogues with diverse ambiguity scenarios and also proposes a solution, ClarifyAgent, for improving performance in such interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM clarification benchmarks focus on single-turn or cooperative users and fail to represent realistic multi-turn and ambiguous interactions.

Method: The authors created ClarifyMT-Bench using a five-dimensional ambiguity taxonomy, six user personas, and a hybrid LLM-human pipeline for generating 6,120 dialogues. They assessed ten LLMs and discovered under-clarification tendencies.

Result: LLMs struggle with increasing dialogue depth and exhibit under-clarification bias. ClarifyAgent was proposed as an improvement, breaking clarification into perception, forecasting, tracking, and planning, improving robustness in ambiguous dialogues.

Conclusion: ClarifyMT-Bench serves as a reproducible benchmark for studying when LLMs should clarify or answer, offering insights into handling ambiguity in practical settings, with ClarifyAgent showing significant promise.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as conversational assistants in open-domain, multi-turn settings, where users often provide incomplete or ambiguous information. However, existing LLM-focused clarification benchmarks primarily assume single-turn interactions or cooperative users, limiting their ability to evaluate clarification behavior in realistic settings. We introduce \textbf{ClarifyMT-Bench}, a benchmark for multi-turn clarification grounded in a five-dimensional ambiguity taxonomy and a set of six behaviorally diverse simulated user personas. Through a hybrid LLM-human pipeline, we construct 6,120 multi-turn dialogues capturing diverse ambiguity sources and interaction patterns. Evaluating ten representative LLMs uncovers a consistent under-clarification bias: LLMs tend to answer prematurely, and performance degrades as dialogue depth increases. To mitigate this, we propose \textbf{ClarifyAgent}, an agentic approach that decomposes clarification into perception, forecasting, tracking, and planning, substantially improving robustness across ambiguity conditions. ClarifyMT-Bench establishes a reproducible foundation for studying when LLMs should ask, when they should answer, and how to navigate ambiguity in real-world human-LLM interactions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpidR-Adapt, a method for data-efficient speech adaptation in new languages, achieving significant results with minimal data compared to standard training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency gap between infants' rapid speech acquisition and the data-intensive requirements of self-supervised speech models, aiming for biologically inspired, data-efficient learning.

Method: The method involves casting low-resource speech learning as a meta-learning problem using a multi-task adaptive pre-training protocol (MAdaPT), bi-level optimization framework, and a novel heuristic solution for scalability and computational efficiency.

Result: SpidR-Adapt shows rapid improvements in speech performance metrics with less than one hour of target-language audio, achieving over 100 times the data efficiency of traditional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed SpidR-Adapt demonstrates a practical, architecture-agnostic solution for biologically inspired, data-efficient speech representation learning. The associated code and checkpoints are made public.

Abstract: Human infants, with only a few hundred hours of speech exposure, acquire basic units of new languages, highlighting a striking efficiency gap compared to the data-hungry self-supervised speech models. To address this gap, this paper introduces SpidR-Adapt for rapid adaptation to new languages using minimal unlabeled data. We cast such low-resource speech representation learning as a meta-learning problem and construct a multi-task adaptive pre-training (MAdaPT) protocol which formulates the adaptation process as a bi-level optimization framework. To enable scalable meta-training under this framework, we propose a novel heuristic solution, first-order bi-level optimization (FOBLO), avoiding heavy computation costs. Finally, we stabilize meta-training by using a robust initialization through interleaved supervision which alternates self-supervised and supervised objectives. Empirically, SpidR-Adapt achieves rapid gains in phonemic discriminability (ABX) and spoken language modeling (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC), improving over in-domain language models after training on less than 1h of target-language audio, over $100\times$ more data-efficient than standard training. These findings highlight a practical, architecture-agnostic path toward biologically inspired, data-efficient representations. We open-source the training code and model checkpoints at https://github.com/facebookresearch/spidr-adapt.

*Divij Dudeja,Mayukha Pal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SMART introduces a hierarchical processing model for better understanding and extracting information from dense engineering manuals, outperforming GPT-2 and BERT in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of processing and understanding dense and lengthy engineering manuals using current transformer models, which treat the material as flat streams of tokens, resulting in inefficiencies and errors.

Method: SMART model employs a hierarchical structure: (1) A syntax-aware Fact Extractor (Tree LSTM) to extract relations, (2) A compact indexed memory MANN to store and retrieve indexed vectors, and (3) A lightweight 6-layer Transformer to utilize the extracted and retrieved facts for responses.

Result: SMART uses 64%-69% fewer parameters than GPT-2 and BERT while achieving 21.3% higher accuracy. It also offers dual inference paths for rapid response to known and new documents, reducing errors and hallucinations in real-world applications.

Conclusion: SMART provides a more practical, accurate, and computationally efficient solution to process technical and complex engineering manuals compared to conventional small transformer models.

Abstract: The user of Engineering Manuals (EM) finds it difficult to read EM s because they are long, have a dense format which includes written documents, step by step procedures, and standard parameter lists for engineering equipment. Off the shelf transformers, especially compact ones, treat this material as a flat stream of tokens. This approach leads to confident but incorrect numeric answers and forces the models to memorize separate facts inefficiently. SMART (Structured Memory and Reasoning Transformer) offers a different and practical solution to the above problem. SMART structures its processing by using a hierarchical approach, and is based upon three main job categories (1) A syntax-aware Fact Extractor (Grammarian) Tree LSTM which extracts facts as subject relation object relations from EM sentences (2) A compact indexed memory MANN (Memory Augmented Neural Network) that indexes these Rational Subject Relation Objects as 384 dimensional vectors that are associated with the source of the information, and (3) A 6 layer Transformer that learns to fuse the previously retrieved facts into its generated response. The entire SMART model utilizes 45.51M parameters, which is 64% less than GPT-2 (124M) and 69% less than BERT (133M), and it achieves a 21.3% higher accuracy than GPT-2, indicating that SMART fits the data better with the least amount of processing requirements. SMART employs dual modes of inference an indexed fast path for known documents (sub-second answer times) and an indexed dynamic path assisted by RAGs for new uploads (FAISS Top 20 results with memory severed at 64 slots). In real world deployment, this framework leads to more well supported results with reduced hallucinations than comparable small transformer models.

*Felix Draxler,Justus Will,Farrin Marouf Sofian,Theofanis Karaletsos,Sameer Singh,Stephan Mandt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Parallel Token Prediction (PTP) is a framework for parallel sequence generation, enabling joint prediction of multiple tokens and reducing latency while maintaining modeling accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the latency bottleneck of autoregressive decoding in language models and avoid independence restrictions posed by existing multi-token prediction approaches.

Method: PTP incorporates the sampling process directly into transformer-based models, allowing for joint token prediction. It is trained via model distillation or inverse autoregressive training without relying on a teaching model.

Result: PTP achieves state-of-the-art speculative decoding results, with Vicuna-7B model accepting over four tokens per step in experiments.

Conclusion: Parallel sequence generation for long sequences can be achieved efficiently with PTP, without compromising the modeling capacity of language models.

Abstract: We propose Parallel Token Prediction (PTP), a universal framework for parallel sequence generation in language models. PTP jointly predicts multiple dependent tokens in a single transformer call by incorporating the sampling procedure into the model. This reduces the latency bottleneck of autoregressive decoding, and avoids the restrictive independence assumptions common in existing multi-token prediction methods. We prove that PTP can represent arbitrary autoregressive sequence distributions. PTP is trained either by distilling an existing model or through inverse autoregressive training without a teacher. Experimentally, we achieve state-of-the-art speculative decoding performance on Vicuna-7B by accepting over four tokens per step on Spec-Bench. The universality of our framework indicates that parallel generation of long sequences is feasible without loss of modeling power.

*Xinhe Wang,Jin Huang,Xingjian Zhang,Tianhao Wang,Jiaqi W. Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates reasoning benchmarks like ARC and argues the performance gap observed in AI models is primarily due to limitations in visual perception, not reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether visual perception or reasoning deficiencies are the primary cause of AI's struggles with ARC-style reasoning benchmarks.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage experimental pipeline: first, converting images into natural-language descriptions (perception), and then inducing and applying rules in a reasoning phase using these descriptions, isolating perception challenges from reasoning capabilities.

Result: Experiments across three datasets (Mini-ARC, ACRE, Bongard-LOGO) reveal perception capability accounts for most performance gaps, with manual analysis showing 80% of errors stemming from perception issues.

Conclusion: Performance issues in AI for ARC-style tasks are largely due to perception challenges. The study calls for evaluation methods separating perception and reasoning to more accurately measure progress in AI reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Reasoning benchmarks such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) and ARC-AGI are widely used to assess progress in artificial intelligence and are often interpreted as probes of core, so-called ``fluid'' reasoning abilities. Despite their apparent simplicity for humans, these tasks remain challenging for frontier vision-language models (VLMs), a gap commonly attributed to deficiencies in machine reasoning. We challenge this interpretation and hypothesize that the gap arises primarily from limitations in visual perception rather than from shortcomings in inductive reasoning.
  To verify this hypothesis, we introduce a two-stage experimental pipeline that explicitly separates perception and reasoning. In the perception stage, each image is independently converted into a natural-language description, while in the reasoning stage a model induces and applies rules using these descriptions. This design prevents leakage of cross-image inductive signals and isolates reasoning from perception bottlenecks. Across three ARC-style datasets, Mini-ARC, ACRE, and Bongard-LOGO, we show that the perception capability is the dominant factor underlying the observed performance gap by comparing the two-stage pipeline with against standard end-to-end one-stage evaluation. Manual inspection of reasoning traces in the VLM outputs further reveals that approximately 80 percent of model failures stem from perception errors. Together, these results demonstrate that ARC-style benchmarks conflate perceptual and reasoning challenges and that observed performance gaps may overstate deficiencies in machine reasoning. Our findings underscore the need for evaluation protocols that disentangle perception from reasoning when assessing progress in machine intelligence.

Abstract: We present C2LLM - Contrastive Code Large Language Models, a family of code embedding models in both 0.5B and 7B sizes. Building upon Qwen-2.5-Coder backbones, C2LLM adopts a Pooling by Multihead Attention (PMA) module for generating sequence embedding from token embeddings, effectively 1) utilizing the LLM's causal representations acquired during pretraining, while also 2) being able to aggregate information from all tokens in the sequence, breaking the information bottleneck in EOS-based sequence embeddings, and 3) supporting flexible adaptation of embedding dimension, serving as an alternative to MRL. Trained on three million publicly available data, C2LLM models set new records on MTEB-Code among models of similar sizes, with C2LLM-7B ranking 1st on the overall leaderboard.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the sensitivity of Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) to decoding order by introducing Denoising Entropy, a metric to measure predictive uncertainty and guide generation, resulting in improved output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked Diffusion Models, while flexible, struggle with output quality variability due to decoding order. The aim is to formalize this problem and address it.

Method: The authors introduce Denoising Entropy as a metric for predictive uncertainty and propose two entropy-guided algorithms: a post-hoc selection method and a real-time guidance strategy.

Result: The proposed methods significantly improve MDM generation quality, with enhanced performance on tasks like reasoning, planning, and coding.

Conclusion: Denoising Entropy is a powerful tool that transforms predictive uncertainty into a controllable advantage in MDMs, improving their overall robustness and utility.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) offer flexible, non-autoregressive generation, but this freedom introduces a challenge: final output quality is highly sensitive to the decoding order. We are the first to formalize this issue, attributing the variability in output quality to the cumulative predictive uncertainty along a generative path. To quantify this uncertainty, we introduce Denoising Entropy, a computable metric that serves as an internal signal for evaluating generative process. Leveraging this metric, we propose two algorithms designed to optimize the decoding path: a post-hoc selection method and a real-time guidance strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our entropy-guided methods significantly improve generation quality, consistently boosting accuracy on challenging reasoning, planning, and code benchmarks. Our work establishes Denoising Entropy as a principled tool for understanding and controlling generation, effectively turning the uncertainty in MDMs from a liability into a key advantage for discovering high-quality solutions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VL4Gaze, a benchmark dataset for evaluating gaze understanding in vision-language models (VLMs), showing that task-specific supervision improves gaze interpretation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaze understanding is crucial for scene interpretation, yet remains unexplored in existing VLMs. There is also no benchmark to evaluate gaze understanding or ascertain its potential emergence from general-purpose VLM training.

Method: The authors developed VL4Gaze, a dataset with 489K automatically generated question-answer pairs derived from 124K images. This facilitates a unified VQA framework for gaze understanding across four tasks: gaze object description, gaze direction description, gaze point location, and ambiguous question recognition. They evaluate commercial and open-source VLMs under in-context learning and fine-tuning settings.

Result: VLMs generally struggle with gaze semantics and spatial localization in the absence of task-specific supervision. However, training on VL4Gaze significantly improves performance across all tasks.

Conclusion: Targeted, multi-task supervision is essential for enhancing VLMs' ability to understand gaze-related information. The authors also plan to release their dataset and code to promote further research.

Abstract: Human gaze provides essential cues for interpreting attention, intention, and social interaction in visual scenes, yet gaze understanding remains largely unexplored in current vision-language models (VLMs). While recent VLMs achieve strong scene-level reasoning across a range of visual tasks, there exists no benchmark that systematically evaluates or trains them for gaze interpretation, leaving open the question of whether gaze understanding can emerge from general-purpose vision-language pre-training. To address this gap, we introduce VL4Gaze, the first large-scale benchmark designed to investigate, evaluate, and unlock the potential of VLMs for gaze understanding. VL4Gaze contains 489K automatically generated question-answer pairs across 124K images and formulates gaze understanding as a unified VQA problem through four complementary tasks: (1) gaze object description, (2) gaze direction description, (3) gaze point location, and (4) ambiguous question recognition. We comprehensively evaluate both commercial and open-source VLMs under in-context learning and fine-tuning settings. The results show that even large-scale VLMs struggle to reliably infer gaze semantics and spatial localization without task-specific supervision. In contrast, training on VL4Gaze brings substantial and consistent improvements across all tasks, highlighting the importance of targeted multi-task supervision for developing gaze understanding capabilities in VLMs. We will release the dataset and code to support further research and development in this direction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address trash detection challenges on constrained hardware and improve the accuracy and efficiency of models for edge devices and IoT applications.

Method: The method involves building an iterative hardware-aware neural architecture search framework, utilizing a Once-for-All-style ResDets supernet with backbone and neck/head optimization, iterative evolutionary search, and an accuracy predictor.

Result: The TrashDets family achieves mAP50 values from 11.4 to 19.5 with parameter scales from 1.2M to 30.5M. Specialized variants demonstrate efficiency gains with reduced energy (88%) and latency (78%) on hardware-specific deployments.

Conclusion: TrashDet provides scalable detector options for TinyML applications, improving both accuracy and resource efficiency for constrained hardware environments.

Abstract: This paper addresses trash detection on the TACO dataset under strict TinyML constraints using an iterative hardware-aware neural architecture search framework targeting edge and IoT devices. The proposed method constructs a Once-for-All-style ResDets supernet and performs iterative evolutionary search that alternates between backbone and neck/head optimization, supported by a population passthrough mechanism and an accuracy predictor to reduce search cost and improve stability. This framework yields a family of deployment-ready detectors, termed TrashDets. On a five-class TACO subset (paper, plastic, bottle, can, cigarette), the strongest variant, TrashDet-l, achieves 19.5 mAP50 with 30.5M parameters, improving accuracy by up to 3.6 mAP50 over prior detectors while using substantially fewer parameters. The TrashDet family spans 1.2M to 30.5M parameters with mAP50 values between 11.4 and 19.5, providing scalable detector options for diverse TinyML deployment budgets on resource-constrained hardware. On the MAX78002 microcontroller with the TrashNet dataset, two specialized variants, TrashDet-ResNet and TrashDet-MBNet, jointly dominate the ai87-fpndetector baseline, with TrashDet-ResNet achieving 7525~$μ$J energy per inference at 26.7 ms latency and 37.45 FPS, and TrashDet-MBNet improving mAP50 by 10.2%; together they reduce energy consumption by up to 88%, latency by up to 78%, and average power by up to 53% compared to existing TinyML detectors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OccuFly, a LiDAR-free, camera-based aerial semantic scene completion (SSC) benchmark for UAV-based 3D perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous UAV applications require robust 3D scene understanding, but existing SSC research largely focuses on ground-based scenarios and relies on LiDAR sensors, which are unsuitable for UAVs.

Method: OccuFly utilizes traditional 3D reconstruction for camera-based data generation and automates label transfer from 2D masks to 3D point clouds, reducing manual annotation efforts.

Result: The paper establishes a benchmark for aerial SSC using the OccuFly dataset, demonstrating limitations of current models for elevated viewpoints and varied scenarios.

Conclusion: OccuFly advances aerial SSC research by addressing LiDAR limitations, offering a comprehensive dataset, and identifying challenges for UAV-based 3D perception.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is crucial for 3D perception in mobile robotics, as it enables holistic scene understanding by jointly estimating dense volumetric occupancy and per-voxel semantics. Although SSC has been widely studied in terrestrial domains such as autonomous driving, aerial scenarios like autonomous flying remain largely unexplored, thereby limiting progress on downstream applications. Furthermore, LiDAR sensors represent the primary modality for SSC data generation, which poses challenges for most uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) due to flight regulations, mass and energy constraints, and the sparsity of LiDAR-based point clouds from elevated viewpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce OccuFly, the first real-world, camera-based aerial SSC benchmark, captured at altitudes of 50m, 40m, and 30m during spring, summer, fall, and winter. OccuFly covers urban, industrial, and rural scenarios, provides 22 semantic classes, and the data format adheres to established conventions to facilitate seamless integration with existing research. Crucially, we propose a LiDAR-free data generation framework based on camera modality, which is ubiquitous on modern UAVs. By utilizing traditional 3D reconstruction, our framework automates label transfer by lifting a subset of annotated 2D masks into the reconstructed point cloud, thereby substantially minimizing manual 3D annotation effort. Finally, we benchmark the state-of-the-art on OccuFly and highlight challenges specific to elevated viewpoints, yielding a comprehensive vision benchmark for holistic aerial 3D scene understanding.

### [68] [NULLBUS: Multimodal Mixed-Supervision for Breast Ultrasound Segmentation via Nullable Global-Local Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20783)
*Raja Mallina,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NullBUS, a framework designed for breast ultrasound segmentation that uses mixed supervision from both prompted and non-prompted data, achieving high segmentation performance on public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in improving lesion segmentation in breast ultrasound images for better diagnosis and treatment. Existing methods face challenges due to the unavailability of reliable metadata across datasets, reducing robustness.

Method: The NullBUS framework employs a novel mechanism called nullable prompts, which are learnable null embeddings with presence masks. This approach allows the model to alternate between image-only and text/image-based prompts, adapting to the availability of metadata.

Result: NullBUS achieves superior performance with a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.8568 and a mean Dice coefficient of 0.9103 across three public breast ultrasound datasets under mixed prompt availability.

Conclusion: NullBUS proves to be an effective and robust solution for breast ultrasound segmentation, especially when datasets have mixed metadata availability. Its results set a new standard for integrating multimodal supervision.

Abstract: Breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation provides lesion boundaries essential for computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning. While promptable methods can improve segmentation performance and tumor delineation when text or spatial prompts are available, many public BUS datasets lack reliable metadata or reports, constraining training to small multimodal subsets and reducing robustness. We propose NullBUS, a multimodal mixed-supervision framework that learns from images with and without prompts in a single model. To handle missing text, we introduce nullable prompts, implemented as learnable null embeddings with presence masks, enabling fallback to image-only evidence when metadata are absent and the use of text when present. Evaluated on a unified pool of three public BUS datasets, NullBUS achieves a mean IoU of 0.8568 and a mean Dice of 0.9103, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance under mixed prompt availability.

*Reeshad Khan amd John Gauch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework that integrates optics, sensors, and segmentation models to improve autonomous driving perception through a RAW-to-task pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiencies in traditional autonomous driving pipelines that decouple camera design from perception, leading to loss of information and adaptive challenges.

Method: A task-driven co-design framework optimizing optics, sensor modeling, noise processes, and segmentation networks in an end-to-end pipeline.

Result: Consistent improvements in mIoU on KITTI-360, demonstrating enhanced robustness for edge deployable models.

Conclusion: Co-optimization of optics, sensors, and networks provides a reliable and efficient path for advancing autonomous driving perception.

Abstract: Traditional autonomous driving pipelines decouple camera design from downstream perception, relying on fixed optics and handcrafted ISPs that prioritize human viewable imagery rather than machine semantics. This separation discards information during demosaicing, denoising, or quantization, while forcing models to adapt to sensor artifacts. We present a task-driven co-design framework that unifies optics, sensor modeling, and lightweight semantic segmentation networks into a single end-to-end RAW-to-task pipeline. Building on DeepLens[19], our system integrates realistic cellphone-scale lens models, learnable color filter arrays, Poisson-Gaussian noise processes, and quantization, all optimized directly for segmentation objectives. Evaluations on KITTI-360 show consistent mIoU improvements over fixed pipelines, with optics modeling and CFA learning providing the largest gains, especially for thin or low-light-sensitive classes. Importantly, these robustness gains are achieved with a compact ~1M-parameter model running at ~28 FPS, demonstrating edge deployability. Visual and quantitative analyses further highlight how co-designed sensors adapt acquisition to semantic structure, sharpening boundaries and maintaining accuracy under blur, noise, and low bit-depth. Together, these findings establish full-stack co-optimization of optics, sensors, and networks as a principled path toward efficient, reliable, and deployable perception in autonomous systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CHAMMI-75 dataset offers diverse microscopy images for developing adaptive cellular morphology models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cellular morphology models are limited by reliance on single imaging types, restricting reuse across studies.

Method: Curated CHAMMI-75, a dataset from 75 studies, for examining channel-adaptive models.

Result: Using CHAMMI-75 enhances performance in multi-channel bioimaging tasks due to diverse microscopy modalities.

Conclusion: CHAMMI-75 enables future advancements in adaptive and versatile cellular morphology models for biological research.

Abstract: Quantifying cell morphology using images and machine learning has proven to be a powerful tool to study the response of cells to treatments. However, models used to quantify cellular morphology are typically trained with a single microscopy imaging type. This results in specialized models that cannot be reused across biological studies because the technical specifications do not match (e.g., different number of channels), or because the target experimental conditions are out of distribution. Here, we present CHAMMI-75, an open access dataset of heterogeneous, multi-channel microscopy images from 75 diverse biological studies. We curated this resource from publicly available sources to investigate cellular morphology models that are channel-adaptive and can process any microscopy image type. Our experiments show that training with CHAMMI-75 can improve performance in multi-channel bioimaging tasks primarily because of its high diversity in microscopy modalities. This work paves the way to create the next generation of cellular morphology models for biological studies.

*Putu Indah Githa Cahyani,Komang David Dananjaya Suartana,Novanto Yudistira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive visual preprocessing method to enhance efficiency in vision-language models (VLMs) by dynamically adjusting image resolution and coverage, yielding significant computational savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of high inference latency and computational costs in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), especially for high-resolution visual inputs, and aims to achieve more efficient deployment.

Method: A content-aware adaptive visual preprocessing approach is developed that adjusts input resolution and cropping dynamically based on image characteristics. This method integrates with FastVLM without altering its architecture or requiring retraining.

Result: The method reduced per-image inference time by over 50%, decreased visual token count by more than 55%, and improved efficiency-oriented metrics on the DocVQA dataset.

Conclusion: Input-aware preprocessing offers a lightweight and effective solution to enhance the deployment efficiency of VLMs, without compromising on architectural integrity or retraining, proving its practical value in real-world applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on multimodal reasoning tasks, but their deployment remains challenging due to high inference latency and computational cost, particularly when processing high-resolution visual inputs. While recent architectures such as FastVLM improve efficiency through optimized vision encoders, existing pipelines still rely on static visual preprocessing, leading to redundant computation for visually simple inputs. In this work, we propose an adaptive visual preprocessing method that dynamically adjusts input resolution and spatial coverage based on image content characteristics. The proposed approach combines content-aware image analysis, adaptive resolution selection, and content-aware cropping to reduce visual redundancy prior to vision encoding. Importantly, the method is integrated with FastVLM without modifying its architecture or requiring retraining. We evaluate the proposed method on a subset of the DocVQA dataset in an inference-only setting, focusing on efficiency-oriented metrics. Experimental results show that adaptive preprocessing reduces per-image inference time by over 50\%, lowers mean full generation time, and achieves a consistent reduction of more than 55\% in visual token count compared to the baseline pipeline. These findings demonstrate that input-aware preprocessing is an effective and lightweight strategy for improving deployment-oriented efficiency of vision-language models. To facilitate reproducibility, our implementation is provided as a fork of the FastVLM repository, incorporating the files for the proposed method, and is available at https://github.com/kmdavidds/mlfastlm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores automated pollen recognition using YOLOv8s and MobileNetV3L on hybrid optical and holographic microscopy datasets, improving DIHM image recognition via GAN-based augmentation, though challenges remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the challenge of recognizing pollen in holographic microscopy images, which are impeded by noise, artifacts, and disparities from bright-field images, thereby enhancing fully automated workflows.

Method: The researchers trained YOLOv8s for detection and MobileNetV3L for classification on a dual-modality dataset, implemented bounding box expansion, and used Wasserstein GANs with spectral normalization for synthetic data augmentation.

Result: In optical microscopy data, detection mAP50 was 91.3% and classification accuracy 97%. For DIHM images, results were lower, but GAN-based data augmentation improved detection performances from 8.15% to 15.4%.

Conclusion: Although substantial challenges persist, GAN-augmented approaches show promise in advancing fully automated analysis of DIHM images in veterinary imaging.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on fully automated pollen recognition across both conventional optical and digital in-line holographic microscopy (DIHM) images of sample slides. Visually recognizing pollen in unreconstructed holographic images remains challenging due to speckle noise, twin-image artifacts and substantial divergence from bright-field appearances. We establish the performance baseline by training YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for classification on a dual-modality dataset of automatically annotated optical and affinely aligned DIHM images. On optical data, detection mAP50 reaches 91.3% and classification accuracy reaches 97%, whereas on DIHM data, we achieve only 8.15% for detection mAP50 and 50% for classification accuracy. Expanding the bounding boxes of pollens in DIHM images over those acquired in aligned optical images achieves 13.3% for detection mAP50 and 54% for classification accuracy. To improve object detection in DIHM images, we employ a Wasserstein GAN with spectral normalization (WGAN-SN) to create synthetic DIHM images, yielding an FID score of 58.246. Mixing real-world and synthetic data at the 1.0 : 1.5 ratio for DIHM images improves object detection up to 15.4%. These results demonstrate that GAN-based augmentation can reduce the performance divide, bringing fully automated DIHM workflows for veterinary imaging a small but important step closer to practice.

*Md Zabirul Islam,Md Motaleb Hossen Manik,Ge Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALIVE is a system that transforms video lectures into interactive learning experiences using AI techniques for real-time avatar explanations and content-aware retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video lectures lack real-time interactivity, limiting learners who need clarification without external searches. ALIVE aims to resolve this limitation.

Method: ALIVE uses local hardware to integrate speech transcription, refinement via language models, neural talking-head synthesis, content-aware retrieval, and real-time multimodal interaction tools.

Result: ALIVE demonstrated accuracy in retrieval, responsiveness, and user engagement in a medical imaging course while maintaining privacy by operating locally.

Conclusion: The paper showcases ALIVE as a method to enhance video-based learning using local AI technologies, paving the way for better interactive educational environments.

Abstract: Traditional lecture videos offer flexibility but lack mechanisms for real-time clarification, forcing learners to search externally when confusion arises. Recent advances in large language models and neural avatars provide new opportunities for interactive learning, yet existing systems typically lack lecture awareness, rely on cloud-based services, or fail to integrate retrieval and avatar-delivered explanations in a unified, privacy-preserving pipeline.
  We present ALIVE, an Avatar-Lecture Interactive Video Engine that transforms passive lecture viewing into a dynamic, real-time learning experience. ALIVE operates fully on local hardware and integrates (1) Avatar-delivered lecture generated through ASR transcription, LLM refinement, and neural talking-head synthesis; (2) A content-aware retrieval mechanism that combines semantic similarity with timestamp alignment to surface contextually relevant lecture segments; and (3) Real-time multimodal interaction, enabling students to pause the lecture, ask questions through text or voice, and receive grounded explanations either as text or as avatar-delivered responses.
  To maintain responsiveness, ALIVE employs lightweight embedding models, FAISS-based retrieval, and segmented avatar synthesis with progressive preloading. We demonstrate the system on a complete medical imaging course, evaluate its retrieval accuracy, latency characteristics, and user experience, and show that ALIVE provides accurate, content-aware, and engaging real-time support.
  ALIVE illustrates how multimodal AI-when combined with content-aware retrieval and local deployment-can significantly enhance the pedagogical value of recorded lectures, offering an extensible pathway toward next-generation interactive learning environments.

*Haotian Lv,Chao Li,Jiangbo Dai,Yuhui Zhang,Zepeng Fan,Yiqiu Tan,Dawei Wang,Binglei Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a cutting-edge 3D pipeline detection framework based on optimized deep learning and multi-view feature analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D GPR-based underground pipeline detection methods struggle with weak feature correlation, low accuracy for small-scale targets, and reduced robustness in complex urban scenarios.

Method: A three-view joint analysis strategy involving B/C/D-Scan evaluation, the DCO-YOLO framework for enhanced feature extraction, and a 3D-DIoU spatial feature matching algorithm are proposed to improve pipeline detection.

Result: Experiments on urban pipeline data achieved significant improvements, with detection accuracy of 96.2%, recall of 93.3%, and mAP of 96.7%, exceeding baseline models.

Conclusion: Integrating deep learning with physical 3D GPR attributes provides a reliable framework for efficient underground pipeline recognition and localization.

Abstract: To address the issues of weak correlation between multi-view features, low recognition accuracy of small-scale targets, and insufficient robustness in complex scenarios in underground pipeline detection using 3D GPR, this paper proposes a 3D pipeline intelligent detection framework. First, based on a B/C/D-Scan three-view joint analysis strategy, a three-dimensional pipeline three-view feature evaluation method is established by cross-validating forward simulation results obtained using FDTD methods with actual measurement data. Second, the DCO-YOLO framework is proposed, which integrates DySample, CGLU, and OutlookAttention cross-dimensional correlation mechanisms into the original YOLOv11 algorithm, significantly improving the small-scale pipeline edge feature extraction capability. Furthermore, a 3D-DIoU spatial feature matching algorithm is proposed, which integrates three-dimensional geometric constraints and center distance penalty terms to achieve automated association of multi-view annotations. The three-view fusion strategy resolves inherent ambiguities in single-view detection. Experiments based on real urban underground pipeline data show that the proposed method achieves accuracy, recall, and mean average precision of 96.2%, 93.3%, and 96.7%, respectively, in complex multi-pipeline scenarios, which are 2.0%, 2.1%, and 0.9% higher than the baseline model. Ablation experiments validated the synergistic optimization effect of the dynamic feature enhancement module and Grad-CAM++ heatmap visualization demonstrated that the improved model significantly enhanced its ability to focus on pipeline geometric features. This study integrates deep learning optimization strategies with the physical characteristics of 3D GPR, offering an efficient and reliable novel technical framework for the intelligent recognition and localization of underground pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeRV360 is a new method for efficiently decoding 360-degree videos by focusing only on the viewport selected by the user.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NeRV methods for video compression are memory-intensive and slow, especially for high-resolution 360-degree videos, making them impractical for real-time applications.

Method: NeRV360 introduces a viewport-specific decoding process that incorporates a spatial-temporal affine transform to conditionally decode videos based on the user's viewpoint and time.

Result: Experiments show NeRV360 reduces memory usage 7-fold and increases decoding speed 2.5 times compared to prior methods, while providing better image quality.

Conclusion: NeRV360 improves efficiency and practicality for high-res 360-degree video applications via conditional, viewport-targeted decoding.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations for videos (NeRV) have shown strong potential for video compression. However, applying NeRV to high-resolution 360-degree videos causes high memory usage and slow decoding, making real-time applications impractical. We propose NeRV360, an end-to-end framework that decodes only the user-selected viewport instead of reconstructing the entire panoramic frame. Unlike conventional pipelines, NeRV360 integrates viewport extraction into decoding and introduces a spatial-temporal affine transform module for conditional decoding based on viewpoint and time. Experiments on 6K-resolution videos show that NeRV360 achieves a 7-fold reduction in memory consumption and a 2.5-fold increase in decoding speed compared to HNeRV, a representative prior work, while delivering better image quality in terms of objective metrics.

*Tingfeng Xian,Wenlve Zhou,Zhiheng Zhou,Zhelin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges in the Cross-Modality Ship Re-Identification (CMS Re-ID) task and proposes a novel Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method called Domain Representation Injection (DRI) to efficiently bridge modality gaps without relying on large paired datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of significant modality discrepancies in CMS Re-ID, particularly in achieving accurate maritime target tracking under different conditions, without the dependency on constructing large-scale paired datasets for pre-training.

Method: The proposed method, Domain Representation Injection (DRI), keeps Vision Foundation Models fully frozen while using a lightweight Offset Encoder and a Modulator to extract and adaptively inject domain-specific representation into intermediate layers via additive fusion. This reshapes feature distributions to fit downstream tasks with limited trainable parameters.

Result: The method achieves State-of-the-Art results with minimal parameters, attaining 57.9% and 60.5% mAP on the HOSS-ReID dataset using only 1.54M and 7.05M parameters, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed DRI strategy effectively addresses modality discrepancies in CMS Re-ID, providing a parameter-efficient solution that achieves impressive performance without compromising the VFM's general knowledge.

Abstract: Cross-Modality Ship Re-Identification (CMS Re-ID) is critical for achieving all-day and all-weather maritime target tracking, yet it is fundamentally challenged by significant modality discrepancies. Mainstream solutions typically rely on explicit modality alignment strategies; however, this paradigm heavily depends on constructing large-scale paired datasets for pre-training. To address this, grounded in the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we explore the potential of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) in bridging modality gaps. Recognizing the suboptimal performance of existing generic Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods that operate within the weight space, particularly on limited-capacity models, we shift the optimization perspective to the feature space and propose a novel PEFT strategy termed Domain Representation Injection (DRI). Specifically, while keeping the VFM fully frozen to maximize the preservation of general knowledge, we design a lightweight, learnable Offset Encoder to extract domain-specific representations rich in modality and identity attributes from raw inputs. Guided by the contextual information of intermediate features at different layers, a Modulator adaptively transforms these representations. Subsequently, they are injected into the intermediate layers via additive fusion, dynamically reshaping the feature distribution to adapt to the downstream task without altering the VFM's pre-trained weights. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance with minimal trainable parameters. For instance, on the HOSS-ReID dataset, we attain 57.9\% and 60.5\% mAP using only 1.54M and 7.05M parameters, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/TingfengXian/DRI.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new Dual-Graph Spatiotemporal Attention Network (DGSAN) to enhance pulmonary nodule classification for lung cancer early detection, surpassing traditional methods using effective multimodal information fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve early detection and diagnosis of lung cancer by addressing inefficiencies in current multimodal and multi-temporal information fusion methods.

Method: Introduced the Dual-Graph Spatiotemporal Attention Network (DGSAN) with three key components: a Global-Local Feature Encoder, a Dual-Graph Construction method, and a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Graph Fusion Module.

Result: Experimental results on the NLST-cmst and CSTL-derived datasets show that DGSAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and computational efficiency for pulmonary nodule classification.

Conclusion: The proposed DGSAN approach significantly advances the accuracy and efficiency in classifying pulmonary nodules, supporting more effective early detection of lung cancer.

Abstract: Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Early detection and diagnosis of pulmonary nodules are essential for improving patient survival rates. Although previous research has integrated multimodal and multi-temporal information, outperforming single modality and single time point, the fusion methods are limited to inefficient vector concatenation and simple mutual attention, highlighting the need for more effective multimodal information fusion. To address these challenges, we introduce a Dual-Graph Spatiotemporal Attention Network, which leverages temporal variations and multimodal data to enhance the accuracy of predictions. Our methodology involves developing a Global-Local Feature Encoder to better capture the local, global, and fused characteristics of pulmonary nodules. Additionally, a Dual-Graph Construction method organizes multimodal features into inter-modal and intra-modal graphs. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Graph Fusion Module is introduced to refine feature integration. We also compiled a novel multimodal dataset named the NLST-cmst dataset as a comprehensive source of support for related research. Our extensive experiments, conducted on both the NLST-cmst and curated CSTL-derived datasets, demonstrate that our DGSAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classifying pulmonary nodules with exceptional computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a benchmark to evaluate Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on low-bitrate compressed images and proposes a solution to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked issue of VLMs’ ability to interpret low-bitrate compressed images as they primarily focus on high-bitrate compressed images.

Method: The authors developed a benchmark with over one million compressed images, analyzed performance gaps, and created a universal VLM adaptor to mitigate the identified generalization gap.

Result: The introduced adaptor improved VLM performance on images compressed across diverse codecs and bitrates by 10%-30%.

Conclusion: The benchmark and the proposed solution provide valuable insights into enhancing VLMs for low-bitrate compressed images and bridging the performance gap.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and the growing demand for their applications, efficient compression of the image inputs has become increasingly important. Existing VLMs predominantly digest and understand high-bitrate compressed images, while their ability to interpret low-bitrate compressed images has yet to be explored by far. In this paper, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the ability of VLM against compressed images, varying existing widely used image codecs and diverse set of tasks, encompassing over one million compressed images in our benchmark. Next, we analyse the source of performance gap, by categorising the gap from a) the information loss during compression and b) generalisation failure of VLM. We visualize these gaps with concrete examples and identify that for compressed images, only the generalization gap can be mitigated. Finally, we propose a universal VLM adaptor to enhance model performance on images compressed by existing codecs. Consequently, we demonstrate that a single adaptor can improve VLM performance across images with varying codecs and bitrates by 10%-30%. We believe that our benchmark and enhancement method provide valuable insights and contribute toward bridging the gap between VLMs and compressed images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanoGrounder is a 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) framework using panoramic renderings and pretrained 2D vision-language models (VLMs) for enhanced reasoning and state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DVG models struggle with generalization due to limited datasets and reasoning capabilities of traditional methods, calling for a more robust and generalizable framework.

Method: The proposed framework uses panoramic renderings with 3D features and pretrained 2D VLMs in a three-stage process: viewpoint placement, text grounding on panoramas, and prediction fusion into a 3D bounding box.

Result: PanoGrounder achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets, with superior generalization on unseen 3D datasets and varied text queries.

Conclusion: Panoramic representations effectively enhance vision-language reasoning and generalization in 3DVG, making PanoGrounder a promising solution for bridging vision-language perception and robotics.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) is a critical bridge from vision-language perception to robotics, requiring both language understanding and 3D scene reasoning. Traditional supervised models leverage explicit 3D geometry but exhibit limited generalization, owing to the scarcity of 3D vision-language datasets and the limited reasoning capabilities compared to modern vision-language models (VLMs). We propose PanoGrounder, a generalizable 3DVG framework that couples multi-modal panoramic representation with pretrained 2D VLMs for strong vision-language reasoning. Panoramic renderings, augmented with 3D semantic and geometric features, serve as an intermediate representation between 2D and 3D, and offer two major benefits: (i) they can be directly fed to VLMs with minimal adaptation and (ii) they retain long-range object-to-object relations thanks to their 360-degree field of view. We devise a three-stage pipeline that places a compact set of panoramic viewpoints considering the scene layout and geometry, grounds a text query on each panoramic rendering with a VLM, and fuses per-view predictions into a single 3D bounding box via lifting. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on ScanRefer and Nr3D, and demonstrates superior generalization to unseen 3D datasets and text rephrasings.

*Yingying Wang,Rongjin Zhuang,Hui Zheng,Xuanhua He,Ke Cao,Xiaotong Tu,Xinghao Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SMC-Mamba, a framework for general image fusion that enhances downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation by integrating complementary information across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a general image fusion framework that balances performance improvement across diverse tasks while maintaining low complexity, addressing a gap in non-task-specific fusion methods.

Method: The paper proposes SMC-Mamba, consisting of two modules: MAFE for detail preservation and global representation enhancement, and MCCM for dynamic collaboration among modalities and feature integration. A bi-level self-supervised contrastive learning loss (BSCL) is introduced to improve performance without extra computational cost.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method surpasses SOTA algorithms in various fusion tasks, including infrared-visible, medical, multi-focus, and multi-exposure fusion, and enhances downstream visual tasks.

Conclusion: SMC-Mamba demonstrates strong capabilities in general image fusion, offering improved performance with reduced complexity while being effective across various modalities and downstream applications.

Abstract: Image fusion integrates complementary information from different modalities to generate high-quality fused images, thereby enhancing downstream tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Unlike task-specific techniques that primarily focus on consolidating inter-modal information, general image fusion needs to address a wide range of tasks while improving performance without increasing complexity. To achieve this, we propose SMC-Mamba, a Self-supervised Multiplex Consensus Mamba framework for general image fusion. Specifically, the Modality-Agnostic Feature Enhancement (MAFE) module preserves fine details through adaptive gating and enhances global representations via spatial-channel and frequency-rotational scanning. The Multiplex Consensus Cross-modal Mamba (MCCM) module enables dynamic collaboration among experts, reaching a consensus to efficiently integrate complementary information from multiple modalities. The cross-modal scanning within MCCM further strengthens feature interactions across modalities, facilitating seamless integration of critical information from both sources. Additionally, we introduce a Bi-level Self-supervised Contrastive Learning Loss (BSCL), which preserves high-frequency information without increasing computational overhead while simultaneously boosting performance in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) image fusion algorithms in tasks such as infrared-visible, medical, multi-focus, and multi-exposure fusion, as well as downstream visual tasks.

Result: Experiments on ScanNet and LeRF show that their framework provides superior segmentation quality over state-of-the-art methods, achieving ~43.7x speedup on 512-D feature maps.

Conclusion: Q-Render and GS-Net offer an efficient and high-fidelity solution for open-vocabulary segmentation in 3D domains, enhancing both performance and segmentation quality.

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision have successfully extended Open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) to the 3D domain by leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). Despite this progress, efficiently rendering the high-dimensional features required for open-vocabulary queries poses a significant challenge. Existing methods employ codebooks or feature compression, causing information loss, thereby degrading segmentation quality. To address this limitation, we introduce Quantile Rendering (Q-Render), a novel rendering strategy for 3D Gaussians that efficiently handles high-dimensional features while maintaining high fidelity. Unlike conventional volume rendering, which densely samples all 3D Gaussians intersecting each ray, Q-Render sparsely samples only those with dominant influence along the ray. By integrating Q-Render into a generalizable 3D neural network, we also propose Gaussian Splatting Network (GS-Net), which predicts Gaussian features in a generalizable manner. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and LeRF demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while enabling real-time rendering with an approximate ~43.7x speedup on 512-D feature maps. Code will be made publicly available.

*Shengguang Wu,Xiaohan Wang,Yuhui Zhang,Hao Zhu,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Transductive Visual Programming (TVP), a framework for building tools from experience to improve spatial reasoning in 3D tasks, outperforming existing methods and demonstrating strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle with precise geometric calculations in 3D scenes. Existing visual programming approaches rely on fixed or speculative tools, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: TVP starts with basic tools, accumulates solved examples into an Example Library, and then abstracts patterns into higher-level tools within a dynamic Tool Library, enabling increasingly powerful problem-solving capabilities.

Result: TVP achieves state-of-the-art performance on Omni3D-Bench, surpassing GPT-4o by 22% and existing visual programming systems by 11%. Its tools are used 5x more frequently and show strong generalization to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: Experience-driven transductive tool creation, as demonstrated by TVP, is an effective paradigm for evolving visual programming agents to handle complex spatial reasoning tasks. Code is made publicly available.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D scenes requires precise geometric calculations that challenge vision-language models. Visual programming addresses this by decomposing problems into steps calling specialized tools, yet existing methods rely on either fixed toolsets or speculative tool induction before solving problems, resulting in suboptimal programs and poor utilization of induced tools. We present Transductive Visual Programming (TVP), a novel framework that builds new tools from its own experience rather than speculation. TVP first solves problems using basic tools while accumulating experiential solutions into an Example Library, then abstracts recurring patterns from these programs into reusable higher-level tools for an evolving Tool Library. This allows TVP to tackle new problems with increasingly powerful tools learned from experience. On Omni3D-Bench, TVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming GPT-4o by 22% and the previous best visual programming system by 11%. Our transductively learned tools are used 5x more frequently as core program dependency than inductively created ones, demonstrating more effective tool discovery and reuse. The evolved tools also show strong generalization to unseen spatial tasks, achieving superior performance on benchmarks from SpatialScore-Hard collection without any testset-specific modification. Our work establishes experience-driven transductive tool creation as a powerful paradigm for building self-evolving visual programming agents that effectively tackle challenging spatial reasoning tasks. We release our code at https://transductive-visualprogram.github.io/.

*Hongxing Fan,Shuyu Zhao,Jiayang Ao,Lu Sheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework for amodal completion that explicitly separates semantic planning from visual synthesis, offering robust single-pass synthesis and evaluation metrics for invisible object inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for more reliable approaches to amodal completion that maintain both semantic coherence and structural integrity, addressing the limitations of existing progressive methods.

Method: The study proposes a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework comprising semantic planning and visual synthesis agents. It includes mechanisms like a Verification Agent for error correction and a Diverse Hypothesis Generator for handling ambiguity in invisible regions.

Result: Experiments show that the new framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods in amodal completion across multiple datasets, offering higher semantic consistency and robust evaluation.

Conclusion: With novel mechanisms and the MAC-Score metric, the framework enhances structural and semantic coherence in amodal completion, advancing research in invisible object inference and evaluation.

Abstract: Amodal completion, the task of inferring invisible object parts, faces significant challenges in maintaining semantic consistency and structural integrity. Prior progressive approaches are inherently limited by inference instability and error accumulation. To tackle these limitations, we present a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework that explicitly decouples Semantic Planning from Visual Synthesis. By employing specialized agents for upfront reasoning, our method generates a structured, explicit plan before pixel generation, enabling visually and semantically coherent single-pass synthesis. We integrate this framework with two critical mechanisms: (1) a self-correcting Verification Agent that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to rectify visible region segmentation and identify residual occluders strictly within the Semantic Planning phase, and (2) a Diverse Hypothesis Generator that addresses the ambiguity of invisible regions by offering diverse, plausible semantic interpretations, surpassing the limited pixel-level variations of standard random seed sampling. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of traditional metrics in assessing inferred invisible content, we introduce the MAC-Score (MLLM Amodal Completion Score), a novel human-aligned evaluation metric. Validated against human judgment and ground truth, these metrics establish a robust standard for assessing structural completeness and semantic consistency with visible context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets.

*Ruiqi Liu,Yi Han,Zhengbo Zhang,Liwei Yao,Zhiyuan Yan,Jialiang Shen,ZhiJin Chen,Boyi Sun,Lubin Weng,Jing Dong,Yan Wang,Shu Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting generative model images under real-world conditions by proposing a novel detection paradigm called Real-centric Envelope Modeling (REM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of existing detectors, which overfit to generator-specific artifacts and are sensitive to real-world degradations, especially as generative models evolve and images undergo multi-round post-processing.

Method: The authors propose REM that introduces feature-level perturbations during self-reconstruction to generate near-real samples and uses an envelope estimator to define boundaries around real image distributions. A new benchmark, RealChain, is created to test performance under real-world degradation.

Result: REM outperformed state-of-the-art methods with a 7.5% average improvement across eight benchmarks, and demonstrated exceptional robustness in detecting synthetic images under severely degraded real-world conditions in the RealChain benchmark.

Conclusion: The paper establishes that REM effectively addresses real-world conditions for synthetic image detection, offering a more robust and generalizable approach for this task.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models has intensified the need for reliable and robust detection under real-world conditions. However, existing detectors often overfit to generator-specific artifacts and remain highly sensitive to real-world degradations. As generative architectures evolve and images undergo multi-round cross-platform sharing and post-processing (chain degradations), these artifact cues become obsolete and harder to detect. To address this, we propose Real-centric Envelope Modeling (REM), a new paradigm that shifts detection from learning generator artifacts to modeling the robust distribution of real images. REM introduces feature-level perturbations in self-reconstruction to generate near-real samples, and employs an envelope estimator with cross-domain consistency to learn a boundary enclosing the real image manifold. We further build RealChain, a comprehensive benchmark covering both open-source and commercial generators with simulated real-world degradation. Across eight benchmark evaluations, REM achieves an average improvement of 7.5% over state-of-the-art methods, and notably maintains exceptional generalization on the severely degraded RealChain benchmark, establishing a solid foundation for synthetic image detection under real-world conditions. The code and the RealChain benchmark will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

### [85] [SPOT!: Map-Guided LLM Agent for Unsupervised Multi-CCTV Dynamic Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20975)
*Yujin Noh,Inho Jake Park,Chigon Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPOT, a map-guided LLM agent for vehicle tracking across multi-CCTV setups, addressing blind spots and trajectory issues without prior training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CCTV-based vehicle tracking struggles with blind spots and trajectory discontinuation due to limited coverage and ID switching.

Method: The method organizes spatial information using map-guided LLM agents to predict vehicle movement using chunking, beam search, and real-world coordinate transformations.

Result: Experiments using the CARLA simulator demonstrated improved vehicle trajectory prediction, maintaining continuity across blind spots.

Conclusion: SPOT reliably predicts vehicle movements even in multi-CCTV blind spots, exceeding existing methods in accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: CCTV-based vehicle tracking systems face structural limitations in continuously connecting the trajectories of the same vehicle across multiple camera environments. In particular, blind spots occur due to the intervals between CCTVs and limited Fields of View (FOV), which leads to object ID switching and trajectory loss, thereby reducing the reliability of real-time path prediction. This paper proposes SPOT (Spatial Prediction Over Trajectories), a map-guided LLM agent capable of tracking vehicles even in blind spots of multi-CCTV environments without prior training. The proposed method represents road structures (Waypoints) and CCTV placement information as documents based on 2D spatial coordinates and organizes them through chunking techniques to enable real-time querying and inference. Furthermore, it transforms the vehicle's position into the actual world coordinate system using the relative position and FOV information of objects observed in CCTV images. By combining map spatial information with the vehicle's moving direction, speed, and driving patterns, a beam search is performed at the intersection level to derive candidate CCTV locations where the vehicle is most likely to enter after the blind spot. Experimental results based on the CARLA simulator in a virtual city environment confirmed that the proposed method accurately predicts the next appearing CCTV even in blind spot sections, maintaining continuous vehicle trajectories more effectively than existing techniques.

*Zeqing Song,Zhongmiao Yan,Junyuan Deng,Songpengcheng Xia,Xiang Mu,Jingyi Xu,Qi Wu,Ling Pei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces XGrid-Mapping, a hybrid grid framework combining explicit and implicit representations for more effective and efficient large-scale LiDAR mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve large-scale LiDAR mapping by addressing the inefficiencies of dense and voxel-guided methods while leveraging both geometric structures and dense scene richness.

Method: The authors designed XGrid-Mapping, which combines a sparse grid for geometry and an implicit dense grid for richness, organized using the VDB structure and submaps. They also employ a distillation-based overlap alignment strategy and a dynamic removal module.

Result: XGrid-Mapping outperforms state-of-the-art methods in mapping quality and efficiency, demonstrating robust and scalable performance in large-scale incremental mapping.

Conclusion: The proposed XGrid-Mapping framework successfully bridges the gap between mapping quality and computational efficiency for robust autonomous system development.

Abstract: Large-scale incremental mapping is fundamental to the development of robust and reliable autonomous systems, as it underpins incremental environmental understanding with sequential inputs for navigation and decision-making. LiDAR is widely used for this purpose due to its accuracy and robustness. Recently, neural LiDAR mapping has shown impressive performance; however, most approaches rely on dense implicit representations and underutilize geometric structure, while existing voxel-guided methods struggle to achieve real-time performance. To address these challenges, we propose XGrid-Mapping, a hybrid grid framework that jointly exploits explicit and implicit representations for efficient neural LiDAR mapping. Specifically, the strategy combines a sparse grid, providing geometric priors and structural guidance, with an implicit dense grid that enriches scene representation. By coupling the VDB structure with a submap-based organization, the framework reduces computational load and enables efficient incremental mapping on a large scale. To mitigate discontinuities across submaps, we introduce a distillation-based overlap alignment strategy, in which preceding submaps supervise subsequent ones to ensure consistency in overlapping regions. To further enhance robustness and sampling efficiency, we incorporate a dynamic removal module. Extensive experiments show that our approach delivers superior mapping quality while overcoming the efficiency limitations of voxel-guided methods, thereby outperforming existing state-of-the-art mapping methods.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel data synthesis pipeline to enhance rare lesion diagnosis in chest radiography using diffusion models and advanced learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses diagnostic challenges caused by rare pulmonary anomalies in chest radiography, which hinder generative methods due to insufficient data for rare lesions.

Method: A diffusion model trained on normal X-rays is employed to generate augmented training data by inpainting diseased X-rays to preserve rare lesion classes, paired with LKG and PIL strategies for stable fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments on public lung datasets MIMIC and CheXpert showcase significant performance improvements in diagnostic accuracy using the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The method reliably enhances diagnostic precision for long-tailed pulmonary anomalies, marking a new benchmark in chest radiography analysis.

Abstract: Long-tailed pulmonary anomalies in chest radiography present formidable diagnostic challenges. Despite the recent strides in diffusion-based methods for enhancing the representation of tailed lesions, the paucity of rare lesion exemplars curtails the generative capabilities of these approaches, thereby leaving the diagnostic precision less than optimal. In this paper, we propose a novel data synthesis pipeline designed to augment tail lesions utilizing a copious supply of conventional normal X-rays. Specifically, a sufficient quantity of normal samples is amassed to train a diffusion model capable of generating normal X-ray images. This pre-trained diffusion model is subsequently utilized to inpaint the head lesions present in the diseased X-rays, thereby preserving the tail classes as augmented training data. Additionally, we propose the integration of a Large Language Model Knowledge Guidance (LKG) module alongside a Progressive Incremental Learning (PIL) strategy to stabilize the inpainting fine-tuning process. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on the public lung datasets MIMIC and CheXpert demonstrate that the proposed method sets a new benchmark in performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PUFM++ introduces an advanced flow-matching framework to improve point cloud upsampling along three dimensions: geometric fidelity, robustness to noisy and incomplete inputs, and compatibility with surface-based tasks. It incorporates a two-stage strategy, adaptive sampling, on-manifold constraints, and hierarchical feature interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative modeling shows promising results for upsampling point clouds, but gaps still exist in handling sparse, noisy, and incomplete inputs while maintaining high fidelity.

Method: PUFM++ employs a two-stage flow matching strategy alongside adaptive time scheduling for faster sampling, on-manifold constraints for accurate alignment, and a recurrent interface network (RIN) for enhanced feature interplay.

Result: PUFM++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in point cloud upsampling, showcasing superior visual and quantitative results on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: PUFM++ is effective in improving dense reconstructions from sparse point clouds, making it ideal for tasks requiring high-quality surface alignment and robustness against imperfections.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have demonstrated strong promise for high-quality point cloud upsampling. In this work, we present PUFM++, an enhanced flow-matching framework for reconstructing dense and accurate point clouds from sparse, noisy, and partial observations. PUFM++ improves flow matching along three key axes: (i) geometric fidelity, (ii) robustness to imperfect input, and (iii) consistency with downstream surface-based tasks. We introduce a two-stage flow-matching strategy that first learns a direct, straight-path flow from sparse inputs to dense targets, and then refines it using noise-perturbed samples to approximate the terminal marginal distribution better. To accelerate and stabilize inference, we propose a data-driven adaptive time scheduler that improves sampling efficiency based on interpolation behavior. We further impose on-manifold constraints during sampling to ensure that generated points remain aligned with the underlying surface. Finally, we incorporate a recurrent interface network~(RIN) to strengthen hierarchical feature interactions and boost reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world scans show that PUFM++ sets a new state of the art in point cloud upsampling, delivering superior visual fidelity and quantitative accuracy across a wide range of tasks.

*Xiangzuo Wu,Chengwei Ren,Jun Zhou,Xiu Li,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a feed-forward multi-view inverse rendering method for consistent geometry and material recovery across viewpoints, using attention mechanisms and a strategy for real-world generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive multi-view optimization or fail to ensure consistency across views. This paper aims to solve these problems by introducing a fast and consistent feed-forward approach for multi-view inverse rendering.

Method: The method uses a feed-forward framework that predicts albedo, metallic, roughness, shading, and normals from RGB sequences while utilizing attention mechanisms to ensure intra-view and inter-view coherence. It incorporates a consistency-based fine-tuning strategy to improve real-world generalization.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with improved multi-view consistency, material/normal estimation, and robust generalization to real-world data, as shown via experiments on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: This framework effectively addresses limitations of single-view and multi-view approaches by providing fast, accurate, and consistent multi-view inverse rendering that generalizes well to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-view inverse rendering aims to recover geometry, materials, and illumination consistently across multiple viewpoints. When applied to multi-view images, existing single-view approaches often ignore cross-view relationships, leading to inconsistent results. In contrast, multi-view optimization methods rely on slow differentiable rendering and per-scene refinement, making them computationally expensive and hard to scale. To address these limitations, we introduce a feed-forward multi-view inverse rendering framework that directly predicts spatially varying albedo, metallic, roughness, diffuse shading, and surface normals from sequences of RGB images. By alternating attention across views, our model captures both intra-view long-range lighting interactions and inter-view material consistency, enabling coherent scene-level reasoning within a single forward pass. Due to the scarcity of real-world training data, models trained on existing synthetic datasets often struggle to generalize to real-world scenes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a consistency-based finetuning strategy that leverages unlabeled real-world videos to enhance both multi-view coherence and robustness under in-the-wild conditions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of multi-view consistency, material and normal estimation quality, and generalization to real-world imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NExT-Vid, a novel autoregressive visual generative pretraining framework for modeling images and videos using masked next-frame prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current visual generative pretraining methods such as poor temporal understanding, inaccurate semantic localization, and low-quality generation.

Method: NExT-Vid utilizes a context-isolated autoregressive predictor and a conditioned flow-matching decoder to improve semantic representation and generation quality.

Result: Experiments on large-scale pretrained models show NExT-Vid surpasses previous methods in visual representation learning and downstream classification.

Conclusion: NExT-Vid effectively advances autoregressive visual pretraining, providing stronger visual representations and better performance across classification tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in pretraining general foundation models have significantly improved performance across diverse downstream tasks. While autoregressive (AR) generative models like GPT have revolutionized NLP, most visual generative pretraining methods still rely on BERT-style masked modeling, which often disregards the temporal information essential for video analysis. The few existing autoregressive visual pretraining methods suffer from issues such as inaccurate semantic localization and poor generation quality, leading to poor semantics. In this work, we propose NExT-Vid, a novel autoregressive visual generative pretraining framework that utilizes masked next-frame prediction to jointly model images and videos. NExT-Vid introduces a context-isolated autoregressive predictor to decouple semantic representation from target decoding, and a conditioned flow-matching decoder to enhance generation quality and diversity. Through context-isolated flow-matching pretraining, our approach achieves strong representations. Extensive experiments on large-scale pretrained models demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms previous generative pretraining methods for visual representation learning via attentive probing in downstream classification.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Granular-ball Guided Masking (GBGM) method for structure-aware data augmentation to enhance robustness and accuracy in deep learning models, especially under limited or non-ideal data conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address dependency on large-scale labeled data and overfitting issues faced by deep learning models when data availability is limited or distributions shift.

Method: Granular-ball Guided Masking (GBGM) uses Granular-ball Computing (GBC) for structurally aware data augmentation, applying a hierarchical masking process to preserve semantic and structural regions while discarding redundant ones.

Result: Experiments across benchmarks showed improvement in classification accuracy and masked image reconstruction with GBGM integrating well into CNNs and Vision Transformers.

Conclusion: GBGM is a simple, effective, and broadly applicable strategy for enhancing structural awareness in data augmentation while improving model performance.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in computer vision, but they still rely heavily on large-scale labeled data and tend to overfit when data are limited or distributions shift. Data augmentation, particularly mask-based information dropping, can enhance robustness by forcing models to explore complementary cues; however, existing approaches often lack structural awareness and may discard essential semantics. We propose Granular-ball Guided Masking (GBGM), a structure-aware augmentation strategy guided by Granular-ball Computing (GBC). GBGM adaptively preserves semantically rich, structurally important regions while suppressing redundant areas through a coarse-to-fine hierarchical masking process, producing augmentations that are both representative and discriminative. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in classification accuracy and masked image reconstruction, confirming the effectiveness and broad applicability of the proposed method. Simple and model-agnostic, it integrates seamlessly into CNNs and Vision Transformers and provides a new paradigm for structure-aware data augmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in video editing using pretrained text-to-image models, particularly temporal inconsistency issues and high computational overheads, which limit advancements in video editing.

Method: The method involves integrating the Mamba linear time-series module into a pretrained Stable Diffusion-based model, replacing temporal attention with global frame-level attention. Additional modifications include low-rank approximation for query and key matrices, and weighted averaging techniques to improve computational efficiency and generative performance.

Result: The proposed approach shows promising results in editing diverse aspects of real-world videos, such as attributes, subjects, and locations, while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: FluencyVE demonstrates that integrating linear time-series modules and novel modifications can enable efficient and high-quality video editing, showing potential for widespread application in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have achieved unprecedented success in image generation and editing. However, extending this success to video editing remains challenging. Recent video editing efforts have adapted pretrained text-to-image models by adding temporal attention mechanisms to handle video tasks. Unfortunately, these methods continue to suffer from temporal inconsistency issues and high computational overheads. In this study, we propose FluencyVE, which is a simple yet effective one-shot video editing approach. FluencyVE integrates the linear time-series module, Mamba, into a video editing model based on pretrained Stable Diffusion models, replacing the temporal attention layer. This enables global frame-level attention while reducing the computational costs. In addition, we employ low-rank approximation matrices to replace the query and key weight matrices in the causal attention, and use a weighted averaging technique during training to update the attention scores. This approach significantly preserves the generative power of the text-to-image model while effectively reducing the computational burden. Experiments and analyses demonstrate promising results in editing various attributes, subjects, and locations in real-world videos.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of an efficient defense mechanism to protect portrait videos from the privacy concerns raised by 3D-field TFG methods, which can misuse personal portraits.

Method: The proposed method perturbs the 3D information acquisition process by introducing a similarity-guided parameter sharing mechanism for efficiency and a multi-scale dual-domain attention module for optimized spatial-frequency perturbations.

Result: The framework demonstrated strong defense capabilities, achieving a 47x speed improvement over the fastest baseline, maintaining high video fidelity, and showing robustness to scaling and purification attacks.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective and efficient defense solution protecting videos against 3D-field TFG misuse, validated through extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: State-of-the-art 3D-field video-referenced Talking Face Generation (TFG) methods synthesize high-fidelity personalized talking-face videos in real time by modeling 3D geometry and appearance from reference portrait video. This capability raises significant privacy concerns regarding malicious misuse of personal portraits. However, no efficient defense framework exists to protect such videos against 3D-field TFG methods. While image-based defenses could apply per-frame 2D perturbations, they incur prohibitive computational costs, severe video quality degradation, failing to disrupt 3D information for video protection. To address this, we propose a novel and efficient video defense framework against 3D-field TFG methods, which protects portrait video by perturbing the 3D information acquisition process while maintain high-fidelity video quality. Specifically, our method introduces: (1) a similarity-guided parameter sharing mechanism for computational efficiency, and (2) a multi-scale dual-domain attention module to jointly optimize spatial-frequency perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework exhibits strong defense capability and achieves a 47x acceleration over the fastest baseline while maintaining high fidelity. Moreover, it remains robust against scaling operations and state-of-the-art purification attacks, and the effectiveness of our design choices is further validated through ablation studies.

TL;DR: The study proposes a novel latent diffusion-based model for infrared-to-visible face recognition, achieving enhanced image quality and identity feature preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing facial recognition models perform poorly on infrared images due to domain shifts, and current generative methods face issues of distortion and feature loss.

Method: The paper introduces a latent diffusion-based model with a multi-attribute classifier and the Self-attn Mamba module to enhance image restoration and cross-modal feature modeling.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both image quality and identity preservation on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses challenges in infrared-to-visible face recognition, improving both the quality of generated images and the preservation of identity features.

Abstract: Modern surveillance systems increasingly rely on multi-wavelength sensors and deep neural networks to recognize faces in infrared images captured at night. However, most facial recognition models are trained on visible light datasets, leading to substantial performance degradation on infrared inputs due to significant domain shifts. Early feature-based methods for infrared face recognition proved ineffective, prompting researchers to adopt generative approaches that convert infrared images into visible light images for improved recognition. This paradigm, known as Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR), faces challenges such as model and modality discrepancies, leading to distortion and feature loss in generated images. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel latent diffusion-based model designed to generate high-quality visible face images from thermal inputs while preserving critical identity features. A multi-attribute classifier is incorporated to extract key facial attributes from visible images, mitigating feature loss during infrared-to-visible image restoration. Additionally, we propose the Self-attn Mamba module, which enhances global modeling of cross-modal features and significantly improves inference speed. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both image quality and identity preservation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Next-Scale Prediction (NSP), a self-supervised image denoising method addressing the balance between removing noise and preserving fine details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this work is to solve the antagonistic trade-off between decorrelating spatially structured noise and preserving high-frequency details in real-world image denoising.

Method: NSP utilizes cross-scale training pairs, feeding low-resolution sub-images to predict high-resolution targets, combining noise decorrelation and detail preservation effectively.

Result: NSP achieves state-of-the-art results for self-supervised denoising on real-world benchmarks and enables super-resolution for noisy images without requiring additional modifications or retraining.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that NSP resolves the historic challenge between removing correlated noise and retaining fine structures, outperforming existing methods in self-supervised denoising.

Abstract: Self-supervised real-world image denoising remains a fundamental challenge, arising from the antagonistic trade-off between decorrelating spatially structured noise and preserving high-frequency details. Existing blind-spot network (BSN) methods rely on pixel-shuffle downsampling (PD) to decorrelate noise, but aggressive downsampling fragments fine structures, while milder downsampling fails to remove correlated noise. To address this, we introduce Next-Scale Prediction (NSP), a novel self-supervised paradigm that decouples noise decorrelation from detail preservation. NSP constructs cross-scale training pairs, where BSN takes low-resolution, fully decorrelated sub-images as input to predict high-resolution targets that retain fine details. As a by-product, NSP naturally supports super-resolution of noisy images without retraining or modification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSP achieves state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising performance on real-world benchmarks, significantly alleviating the long-standing conflict between noise decorrelation and detail preservation.

Conclusion: KOREATECH-CGH advances ML-CGH research by providing a robust dataset for training and evaluation, along with improved fidelity methods, enabling next-generation holography systems.

Abstract: Machine learning-based computer-generated holography (ML-CGH) has advanced rapidly in recent years, yet progress is constrained by the limited availability of high-quality, large-scale hologram datasets. To address this, we present KOREATECH-CGH, a publicly available dataset comprising 6,000 pairs of RGB-D images and complex holograms across resolutions ranging from 256*256 to 2048*2048, with depth ranges extending to the theoretical limits of the angular spectrum method for wide 3D scene coverage. To improve hologram quality at large depth ranges, we introduce amplitude projection, a post-processing technique that replaces amplitude components of hologram wavefields at each depth layer while preserving phase. This approach enhances reconstruction fidelity, achieving 27.01 dB PSNR and 0.87 SSIM, surpassing a recent optimized silhouette-masking layer-based method by 2.03 dB and 0.04 SSIM, respectively. We further validate the utility of KOREATECH-CGH through experiments on hologram generation and super-resolution using state-of-the-art ML models, confirming its applicability for training and evaluating next-generation ML-CGH systems.

*Zhijie Wang,Liangtian He,Qinghua Zhang,Jifei Miao,Liang-Jian Deng,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reweighted logarithmic norm for low-rank matrix completion to overcome limitations of nuclear norm regularization, solving the optimization problem efficiently with ADMM. Experimental results show superior performance in image inpainting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LRMC methods, which utilize nuclear norm surrogates, suffer from excessive shrinkage of singular values, leading to suboptimal solutions.

Method: A novel reweighted logarithmic norm is proposed as a nonconvex surrogate for the rank function. ADMM is utilized to efficiently solve the optimization problem.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art LRMC techniques in image inpainting, excelling in both visual quality and quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: The reweighted logarithmic norm serves as a more effective surrogate, enabling improved optimization for LRMC tasks and yielding better experimental performance.

Abstract: Low-rank matrix completion (LRMC) has demonstrated remarkable success in a wide range of applications. To address the NP-hard nature of the rank minimization problem, the nuclear norm is commonly used as a convex and computationally tractable surrogate for the rank function. However, this approach often yields suboptimal solutions due to the excessive shrinkage of singular values. In this letter, we propose a novel reweighted logarithmic norm as a more effective nonconvex surrogate, which provides a closer approximation than many existing alternatives. We efficiently solve the resulting optimization problem by employing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Experimental results on image inpainting demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art LRMC approaches, both in terms of visual quality and quantitative metrics.

*Zibin Liu,Banglei Guan,Yang Shang,Shunkun Liang,Zhenbao Yu,Qifeng Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for 6DoF object pose tracking utilizing event cameras to overcome challenges faced by traditional cameras, achieving superior accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camera-based pose tracking methods face difficulties such as motion blur, noise, occlusion, and lighting variations, driving the need for utilizing event cameras with advantages like high dynamic range and low latency.

Method: The authors propose an optical flow-guided 6DoF pose tracking system using event cameras, combining a 2D-3D hybrid feature extraction approach, optical flow computation, and iterative pose optimization.

Result: Their experiments on both simulated and real event data show that their method surpasses current event-based methods in accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enhances 6DoF pose tracking by leveraging event cameras, demonstrating significant improvements over existing techniques.

Abstract: Object pose tracking is one of the pivotal technologies in multimedia, attracting ever-growing attention in recent years. Existing methods employing traditional cameras encounter numerous challenges such as motion blur, sensor noise, partial occlusion, and changing lighting conditions. The emerging bio-inspired sensors, particularly event cameras, possess advantages such as high dynamic range and low latency, which hold the potential to address the aforementioned challenges. In this work, we present an optical flow-guided 6DoF object pose tracking method with an event camera. A 2D-3D hybrid feature extraction strategy is firstly utilized to detect corners and edges from events and object models, which characterizes object motion precisely. Then, we search for the optical flow of corners by maximizing the event-associated probability within a spatio-temporal window, and establish the correlation between corners and edges guided by optical flow. Furthermore, by minimizing the distances between corners and edges, the 6DoF object pose is iteratively optimized to achieve continuous pose tracking. Experimental results of both simulated and real events demonstrate that our methods outperform event-based state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness.

*Kaustubh Kundu,Hrishav Bakul Barua,Lucy Robertson-Bell,Zhixi Cai,Kalin Stefanov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DexAvatar, a framework for reconstructing high-quality 3D hand and body poses from monocular sign language videos, achieving significant improvements over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sign language generation heavily relies on data-driven methods requiring accurate 2D and 3D pose data, but available datasets predominantly contain 2D keypoints with poor-quality 3D reconstructions due to issues like noise and motion blur.

Method: DexAvatar introduces a framework using learned 3D hand and body priors to reconstruct bio-mechanically accurate 3D movements from monocular sign language videos.

Result: DexAvatar achieves a 35.11% improvement in motion capture accuracy over state-of-the-art methods in the SGNify motion capture dataset.

Conclusion: DexAvatar offers a promising approach to enhance the quality of sign language motion capture, facilitating better generative sign language models and addressing key challenges in 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: The trend in sign language generation is centered around data-driven generative methods that require vast amounts of precise 2D and 3D human pose data to achieve an acceptable generation quality. However, currently, most sign language datasets are video-based and limited to automatically reconstructed 2D human poses (i.e., keypoints) and lack accurate 3D information. Furthermore, existing state-of-the-art for automatic 3D human pose estimation from sign language videos is prone to self-occlusion, noise, and motion blur effects, resulting in poor reconstruction quality. In response to this, we introduce DexAvatar, a novel framework to reconstruct bio-mechanically accurate fine-grained hand articulations and body movements from in-the-wild monocular sign language videos, guided by learned 3D hand and body priors. DexAvatar achieves strong performance in the SGNify motion capture dataset, the only benchmark available for this task, reaching an improvement of 35.11% in the estimation of body and hand poses compared to the state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents UniPath, a framework for semantic-driven pathology image generation, which addresses challenges like data scarcity, semantic control, and terminological heterogeneity. It achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper stems from the gap between advanced understanding models in computational pathology and the limited capabilities of generative models, particularly the lack of semantic control, terminological challenges, and data scarcity.

Method: The paper introduces the UniPath framework, which employs Multi-Stream Control comprising Raw-Text, High-Level Semantics, and Prototype streams. It uses curated large-scale datasets and extracts diagnostic semantic tokens using frozen pathology MLLMs for better control in generative tasks.

Result: UniPath achieves a Patho-FID of 80.9 (51% better than the second-best) and demonstrates fine-grained semantic control with performance near real-image levels (98.7%). The curated dataset and pre-trained models will be publicly available.

Conclusion: UniPath successfully integrates semantics-driven generation with state-of-the-art performance and provides a framework to bridge the gap between imagery generation and diagnostic-level understanding in computational pathology.

Abstract: In computational pathology, understanding and generation have evolved along disparate paths: advanced understanding models already exhibit diagnostic-level competence, whereas generative models largely simulate pixels. Progress remains hindered by three coupled factors: the scarcity of large, high-quality image-text corpora; the lack of precise, fine-grained semantic control, which forces reliance on non-semantic cues; and terminological heterogeneity, where diverse phrasings for the same diagnostic concept impede reliable text conditioning. We introduce UniPath, a semantics-driven pathology image generation framework that leverages mature diagnostic understanding to enable controllable generation. UniPath implements Multi-Stream Control: a Raw-Text stream; a High-Level Semantics stream that uses learnable queries to a frozen pathology MLLM to distill paraphrase-robust Diagnostic Semantic Tokens and to expand prompts into diagnosis-aware attribute bundles; and a Prototype stream that affords component-level morphological control via a prototype bank. On the data front, we curate a 2.65M image-text corpus and a finely annotated, high-quality 68K subset to alleviate data scarcity. For a comprehensive assessment, we establish a four-tier evaluation hierarchy tailored to pathology. Extensive experiments demonstrate UniPath's SOTA performance, including a Patho-FID of 80.9 (51% better than the second-best) and fine-grained semantic control achieving 98.7% of the real-image. The meticulously curated datasets, complete source code, and pre-trained model weights developed in this study will be made openly accessible to the public.

TL;DR: This paper presents a method named Decomposition and Composition for efficient and effective multimodal action representation learning, addressing computational overhead and performance issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenge of efficiently leveraging the complementarity among diverse modalities in multimodal human action understanding while avoiding computational overhead.

Method: The authors propose a method combining Decomposition (separating fused multimodal features and aligning them with unimodal counterparts) and Composition (integrating unimodal features for self-supervised multimodal representation learning).

Result: The method achieves an excellent balance between computational efficiency and performance, as shown in experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD II datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective in improving multimodal action understanding while maintaining computational efficiency, addressing the core challenge in this domain.

Abstract: Multimodal human action understanding is a significant problem in computer vision, with the central challenge being the effective utilization of the complementarity among diverse modalities while maintaining model efficiency. However, most existing methods rely on simple late fusion to enhance performance, which results in substantial computational overhead. Although early fusion with a shared backbone for all modalities is efficient, it struggles to achieve excellent performance. To address the dilemma of balancing efficiency and effectiveness, we introduce a self-supervised multimodal skeleton-based action representation learning framework, named Decomposition and Composition. The Decomposition strategy meticulously decomposes the fused multimodal features into distinct unimodal features, subsequently aligning them with their respective ground truth unimodal counterparts. On the other hand, the Composition strategy integrates multiple unimodal features, leveraging them as self-supervised guidance to enhance the learning of multimodal representations. Extensive experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD II datasets demonstrate that the proposed method strikes an excellent balance between computational cost and model performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniPR-3D, a novel VPR architecture integrating multi-view information, outperforming single- and multi-view baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VPR methods fail to generalize well across environments and overlook the advantages of multiple views.

Method: UniPR-3D uses a multi-view 3D representation backbone (VGGT) with custom feature aggregators for place recognition. It leverages both 2D and 3D tokens and employs unique aggregation modules and variable-length sequence retrieval.

Result: UniPR-3D achieves state-of-the-art performance in VPR, outperforming traditional methods and demonstrating the strength of geometry-grounded tokens.

Conclusion: The proposed UniPR-3D model successfully combines multi-view and fine-grained feature reasoning to enhance VPR. Its architecture highlights the potential of geometry-based approaches in achieving superior generalization.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has been traditionally formulated as a single-image retrieval task. Using multiple views offers clear advantages, yet this setting remains relatively underexplored and existing methods often struggle to generalize across diverse environments. In this work we introduce UniPR-3D, the first VPR architecture that effectively integrates information from multiple views. UniPR-3D builds on a VGGT backbone capable of encoding multi-view 3D representations, which we adapt by designing feature aggregators and fine-tune for the place recognition task. To construct our descriptor, we jointly leverage the 3D tokens and intermediate 2D tokens produced by VGGT. Based on their distinct characteristics, we design dedicated aggregation modules for 2D and 3D features, allowing our descriptor to capture fine-grained texture cues while also reasoning across viewpoints. To further enhance generalization, we incorporate both single- and multi-frame aggregation schemes, along with a variable-length sequence retrieval strategy. Our experiments show that UniPR-3D sets a new state of the art, outperforming both single- and multi-view baselines and highlighting the effectiveness of geometry-grounded tokens for VPR. Our code and models will be made publicly available on Github https://github.com/dtc111111/UniPR-3D.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for table recognition are slow and lack clarity in their effectiveness. The paper aims to improve efficiency and explainability in extracting structured and unstructured knowledge from tables.

Method: The method introduces a novel multi-task model employing non-causal attention to understand the table structure comprehensively and uses parallel inference to speed up cell content recognition.

Result: The model demonstrates visual and statistical superiority over previous approaches on two significant public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively improves inference speed and delivers clear recognition results, advancing the table recognition domain.

Abstract: The extraction and use of diverse knowledge from numerous documents is a pressing challenge in intelligent information retrieval. Documents contain elements that require different recognition methods. Table recognition typically consists of three subtasks, namely table structure, cell position and cell content recognition. Recent models have achieved excellent recognition with a combination of multi-task learning, local attention, and mutual learning. However, their effectiveness has not been fully explained, and they require a long period of time for inference. This paper presents a novel multi-task model that utilizes non-causal attention to capture the entire table structure, and a parallel inference algorithm for faster cell content inference. The superiority is demonstrated both visually and statistically on two large public datasets.

TL;DR: This paper introduces T2AV-Compass, a unified benchmark for the evaluation of Text-to-Audio-Video generation systems, addressing the fragmented assessment methods with a taxonomy-driven approach and dual-level evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmented and limited evaluation methods for Text-to-Audio-Video (T2AV) systems, which fail to assess cross-modal alignment, instruction following, and realism under complex prompts.

Method: The paper proposes T2AV-Compass, a benchmark with 500 semantically rich and physically plausible prompts generated through a taxonomy-driven pipeline. Evaluation integrates objective metrics (signal-level) and subjective methods using MLLM-as-a-Judge for thorough assessment.

Result: Evaluation of 11 T2AV systems shows significant gaps compared to human-level realism, particularly in audio realism, synchronization, and instruction following, exposing major performance limitations in current models.

Conclusion: T2AV-Compass provides a robust benchmark, indicating substantial room for improvement in T2AV systems and serving as a valuable diagnostic tool for advancing research in this domain.

Abstract: Text-to-Audio-Video (T2AV) generation aims to synthesize temporally coherent video and semantically synchronized audio from natural language, yet its evaluation remains fragmented, often relying on unimodal metrics or narrowly scoped benchmarks that fail to capture cross-modal alignment, instruction following, and perceptual realism under complex prompts. To address this limitation, we present T2AV-Compass, a unified benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of T2AV systems, consisting of 500 diverse and complex prompts constructed via a taxonomy-driven pipeline to ensure semantic richness and physical plausibility. Besides, T2AV-Compass introduces a dual-level evaluation framework that integrates objective signal-level metrics for video quality, audio quality, and cross-modal alignment with a subjective MLLM-as-a-Judge protocol for instruction following and realism assessment. Extensive evaluation of 11 representative T2AVsystems reveals that even the strongest models fall substantially short of human-level realism and cross-modal consistency, with persistent failures in audio realism, fine-grained synchronization, instruction following, etc. These results indicate significant improvement room for future models and highlight the value of T2AV-Compass as a challenging and diagnostic testbed for advancing text-to-audio-video generation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces UniRec-0.1B, a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters, specifically designed for efficient and accurate text and formula recognition across multiple levels, outperforming larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for text and formula recognition are computationally expensive and large in size, creating a demand for a lightweight yet efficient alternative.

Method: The authors proposed UniRec-0.1B, based on the creation of the UniRec40M dataset (comprising 40 million samples) and employed hierarchical supervision training and a semantic-decoupled tokenizer to address structural variability and semantic entanglement.

Result: UniRec-0.1B achieved superior performance compared to both VLMs and domain expert models across multilingual benchmarks, providing a 2-9× speedup in efficiency.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates that UniRec-0.1B effectively balances size, speed, and accuracy for text and formula recognition, offering a highly efficient and practical alternative to traditional VLMs.

Abstract: Text and formulas constitute the core informational components of many documents. Accurately and efficiently recognizing both is crucial for developing robust and generalizable document parsing systems. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive unified recognition of text and formulas. However, they are large-sized and computationally demanding, restricting their usage in many applications. In this paper, we propose UniRec-0.1B, a unified recognition model with only 0.1B parameters. It is capable of performing text and formula recognition at multiple levels, including characters, words, lines, paragraphs, and documents. To implement this task, we first establish UniRec40M, a large-scale dataset comprises 40 million text, formula and their mix samples, enabling the training of a powerful yet lightweight model. Secondly, we identify two challenges when building such a lightweight but unified expert model. They are: structural variability across hierarchies and semantic entanglement between textual and formulaic content. To tackle these, we introduce a hierarchical supervision training that explicitly guides structural comprehension, and a semantic-decoupled tokenizer that separates text and formula representations. Finally, we develop a comprehensive evaluation benchmark covering Chinese and English documents from multiple domains and with multiple levels. Experimental results on this and public benchmarks demonstrate that UniRec-0.1B outperforms both general-purpose VLMs and leading document parsing expert models, while achieving a 2-9$\times$ speedup, validating its effectiveness and efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper presents FreeInpaint, a tuning-free, plug-and-play method for text-guided image inpainting, focusing on improving alignment with textual prompts and visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing inpainting methods that struggle to maintain prompt alignment and visual rationality simultaneously.

Method: The approach involves a prior-guided noise optimization for better alignment of inpainted areas with prompts and a composite guidance objective to enhance denoising and visual coherence.

Result: Extensive experiments show that FreeInpaint is effective and robust across various inpainting diffusion models and metrics.

Conclusion: FreeInpaint significantly improves text-to-image inpainting by optimizing the diffusion process during inference, achieving better fidelity to prompts and visual quality.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting endeavors to generate new content within specified regions of images using textual prompts from users. The primary challenge is to accurately align the inpainted areas with the user-provided prompts while maintaining a high degree of visual fidelity. While existing inpainting methods have produced visually convincing results by leveraging the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, they still struggle to uphold both prompt alignment and visual rationality simultaneously. In this work, we introduce FreeInpaint, a plug-and-play tuning-free approach that directly optimizes the diffusion latents on the fly during inference to improve the faithfulness of the generated images. Technically, we introduce a prior-guided noise optimization method that steers model attention towards valid inpainting regions by optimizing the initial noise. Furthermore, we meticulously design a composite guidance objective tailored specifically for the inpainting task. This objective efficiently directs the denoising process, enhancing prompt alignment and visual rationality by optimizing intermediate latents at each step. Through extensive experiments involving various inpainting diffusion models and evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed FreeInpaint.

Motivation: To assess whether existing VLMs can effectively answer domain-specific marine questions requiring expert knowledge.

Method: Built MarineEval, a detailed benchmark dataset with 2,000 image-based Q&A pairs, ensuring diversity in task and capacity dimensions verified by marine experts.

Result: Benchmarked 17 VLMs, revealing their limited effectiveness in answering domain-specific marine questions and highlighting areas for improvement.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for specialized improvements in VLMs to handle marine domain challenges effectively.

Abstract: We have witnessed promising progress led by large language models (LLMs) and further vision language models (VLMs) in handling various queries as a general-purpose assistant. VLMs, as a bridge to connect the visual world and language corpus, receive both visual content and various text-only user instructions to generate corresponding responses. Though great success has been achieved by VLMs in various fields, in this work, we ask whether the existing VLMs can act as domain experts, accurately answering marine questions, which require significant domain expertise and address special domain challenges/requirements. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and explore the boundary of existing VLMs, we construct the first large-scale marine VLM dataset and benchmark called MarineEval, with 2,000 image-based question-answering pairs. During our dataset construction, we ensure the diversity and coverage of the constructed data: 7 task dimensions and 20 capacity dimensions. The domain requirements are specially integrated into the data construction and further verified by the corresponding marine domain experts. We comprehensively benchmark 17 existing VLMs on our MarineEval and also investigate the limitations of existing models in answering marine research questions. The experimental results reveal that existing VLMs cannot effectively answer the domain-specific questions, and there is still a large room for further performance improvements. We hope our new benchmark and observations will facilitate future research. Project Page: http://marineeval.hkustvgd.com/

TL;DR: The paper introduces TGC-Net, a novel framework to improve text-guided medical segmentation using CLIP, by addressing structural, contextual, and domain-specific issues in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-guided medical segmentation methods suffer from unaligned encoders and limitations in fine-grained anatomical, clinical, and domain-specific text understanding.

Method: The proposed TGC-Net framework includes three key components: (1) Semantic-Structural Synergy Encoder (SSE) for refining image structures, (2) Domain-Augmented Text Encoder (DATE) for integrating medical textual knowledge, and (3) Vision-Language Calibration Module (VLCM) for aligning cross-modal features.

Result: TGC-Net exhibited state-of-the-art segmentation, achieving significant improvements in Dice scores across five datasets of chest X-ray and thoracic CT imaging while using fewer parameters.

Conclusion: TGC-Net successfully addresses key limitations in text-guided medical segmentation, showing its effectiveness in leveraging text-image alignment for accurate segmentation with efficient parameter use.

Abstract: Text-guided medical segmentation enhances segmentation accuracy by utilizing clinical reports as auxiliary information. However, existing methods typically rely on unaligned image and text encoders, which necessitate complex interaction modules for multimodal fusion. While CLIP provides a pre-aligned multimodal feature space, its direct application to medical imaging is limited by three main issues: insufficient preservation of fine-grained anatomical structures, inadequate modeling of complex clinical descriptions, and domain-specific semantic misalignment. To tackle these challenges, we propose TGC-Net, a CLIP-based framework focusing on parameter-efficient, task-specific adaptations. Specifically, it incorporates a Semantic-Structural Synergy Encoder (SSE) that augments CLIP's ViT with a CNN branch for multi-scale structural refinement, a Domain-Augmented Text Encoder (DATE) that injects large-language-model-derived medical knowledge, and a Vision-Language Calibration Module (VLCM) that refines cross-modal correspondence in a unified feature space. Experiments on five datasets across chest X-ray and thoracic CT modalities demonstrate that TGC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer trainable parameters, including notable Dice gains on challenging benchmarks.

To address this gap, we present ORCA, a multi-modal benchmark for marine research comprising 14,647 images from 478 species, with 42,217 bounding box annotations and 22,321 expert-verified instance captions. The dataset provides fine-grained visual and textual annotations that capture morphology-oriented attributes across diverse marine species. To catalyze methodological advances, we evaluate 18 state-of-the-art models on three tasks: object detection (closed-set and open-vocabulary), instance captioning, and visual grounding. Results highlight key challenges, including species diversity, morphological overlap, and specialized domain demands, underscoring the difficulty of marine understanding. ORCA thus establishes a comprehensive benchmark to advance research in marine domain. Project Page: http://orca.hkustvgd.com/.

### [110] [A Turn Toward Better Alignment: Few-Shot Generative Adaptation with Equivariant Feature Rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21174)
*Chenghao Xu,Qi Liu,Jiexi Yan,Muli Yang,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Equivariant Feature Rotation (EFR) to overcome shortcomings in few-shot image generation by adaptively rotating features into an equivariant proxy space for better domain alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot image generation faces the challenge of aligning source and target domain distributions with limited target samples, often leading to distortions or ineffective transfer.

Method: The authors propose Equivariant Feature Rotation (EFR), which uses adaptive rotations within a Lie Group to transform source and target features into a proxy space, maintaining intra-domain structures while aligning features.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that EFR significantly improves generative performance for target domains across commonly used datasets.

Conclusion: EFR effectively addresses domain gap issues in few-shot image generation by leveraging equivariant feature transformations for better domain alignment and knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Few-shot image generation aims to effectively adapt a source generative model to a target domain using very few training images. Most existing approaches introduce consistency constraints-typically through instance-level or distribution-level loss functions-to directly align the distribution patterns of source and target domains within their respective latent spaces. However, these strategies often fall short: overly strict constraints can amplify the negative effects of the domain gap, leading to distorted or uninformative content, while overly relaxed constraints may fail to leverage the source domain effectively. This limitation primarily stems from the inherent discrepancy in the underlying distribution structures of the source and target domains. The scarcity of target samples further compounds this issue by hindering accurate estimation of the target domain's distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose Equivariant Feature Rotation (EFR), a novel adaptation strategy that aligns source and target domains at two complementary levels within a self-rotated proxy feature space. Specifically, we perform adaptive rotations within a parameterized Lie Group to transform both source and target features into an equivariant proxy space, where alignment is conducted. These learnable rotation matrices serve to bridge the domain gap by preserving intra-domain structural information without distortion, while the alignment optimization facilitates effective knowledge transfer from the source to the target domain. Comprehensive experiments on a variety of commonly used datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the generative performance within the targeted domain.

*Chenghao Xu,Guangtao Lyu,Qi Liu,Jiexi Yan,Muli Yang,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a system called NAME for representing human motion sequences with continuous representations, allowing interpolation and extrapolation at arbitrary frame rates. The method employs hierarchical temporal encoding and a custom parametric activation function to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of creating continuous and smooth representations of human motion, enabling interpolation and extrapolation of motion sequences at arbitrary frame rates for better temporal coherence.

Method: The method introduces NAME, a framework based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs), incorporating hierarchical temporal encoding and a parametric activation function using Fourier transformations within an MLP-based decoder.

Result: The evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets validate the robustness and effectiveness of NAME, showcasing its ability to capture intricate temporal patterns and represent complex motion behaviors.

Conclusion: The proposed NAME framework offers a novel approach for continuous human motion representation, enhancing interpolation, inbetweening, and extrapolation in motion sequences at improved accuracy and frame rates.

Abstract: Physical motions are inherently continuous, and higher camera frame rates typically contribute to improved smoothness and temporal coherence. For the first time, we explore continuous representations of human motion sequences, featuring the ability to interpolate, inbetween, and even extrapolate any input motion sequences at arbitrary frame rates. To achieve this, we propose a novel parametric activation-induced hierarchical implicit representation framework, referred to as NAME, based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Our method introduces a hierarchical temporal encoding mechanism that extracts features from motion sequences at multiple temporal scales, enabling effective capture of intricate temporal patterns. Additionally, we integrate a custom parametric activation function, powered by Fourier transformations, into the MLP-based decoder to enhance the expressiveness of the continuous representation. This parametric formulation significantly augments the model's ability to represent complex motion behaviors with high accuracy. Extensive evaluations across several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraShape 1.0 is a scalable 3D diffusion framework for generating high-quality 3D geometry. It uses a two-stage pipeline involving coarse structure synthesis followed by detailed refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve 3D geometry generation quality with better data processing and diffusion models while addressing constraints like limited training resources.

Method: The framework introduces a two-stage generation pipeline: coarse structure synthesis and voxel-based refinement using specialized data processing techniques like RoPE and watertight processing.

Result: UltraShape 1.0 achieves competitive geometric quality relative to existing methods using publicly available datasets, while suffering no compromises despite resource limitations.

Conclusion: The study successfully realizes a scalable solution for 3D geometry generation, offering advances in both data processing quality and generation accuracy, with code/models openly available for research expansion.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce UltraShape 1.0, a scalable 3D diffusion framework for high-fidelity 3D geometry generation. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage generation pipeline: a coarse global structure is first synthesized and then refined to produce detailed, high-quality geometry. To support reliable 3D generation, we develop a comprehensive data processing pipeline that includes a novel watertight processing method and high-quality data filtering. This pipeline improves the geometric quality of publicly available 3D datasets by removing low-quality samples, filling holes, and thickening thin structures, while preserving fine-grained geometric details. To enable fine-grained geometry refinement, we decouple spatial localization from geometric detail synthesis in the diffusion process. We achieve this by performing voxel-based refinement at fixed spatial locations, where voxel queries derived from coarse geometry provide explicit positional anchors encoded via RoPE, allowing the diffusion model to focus on synthesizing local geometric details within a reduced, structured solution space. Our model is trained exclusively on publicly available 3D datasets, achieving strong geometric quality despite limited training resources. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UltraShape 1.0 performs competitively with existing open-source methods in both data processing quality and geometry generation. All code and trained models will be released to support future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark, VisRes Bench, to assess visual reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and reveals their limitations in perceptual and relational reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether VLMs perform genuine visual reasoning or rely heavily on linguistic priors, highlighting gaps in their capabilities.

Method: The study presents VisRes Bench, a benchmark isolating reasoning abilities into three levels: perceptual tasks, single-attribute rule-based inference, and compositional reasoning. It uses over 19,000 controlled task images across these levels.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs exhibit limited capabilities, performing near random on tasks with subtle perceptual perturbations, indicating reliance on pattern recognition over abstract reasoning.

Conclusion: VisRes Bench demonstrates distinct visual reasoning challenges in VLMs and serves as a framework to advance multimodal research in this domain.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning. Yet, the extent to which these models perform visual reasoning as opposed to relying on linguistic priors remains unclear. To address this, we introduce VisRes Bench, a benchmark designed to study visual reasoning in naturalistic settings without contextual language supervision. Analyzing model behavior across three levels of complexity, we uncover clear limitations in perceptual and relational visual reasoning capacities. VisRes isolates distinct reasoning abilities across its levels. Level 1 probes perceptual completion and global image matching under perturbations such as blur, texture changes, occlusion, and rotation; Level 2 tests rule-based inference over a single attribute (e.g., color, count, orientation); and Level 3 targets compositional reasoning that requires integrating multiple visual attributes. Across more than 19,000 controlled task images, we find that state-of-the-art VLMs perform near random under subtle perceptual perturbations, revealing limited abstraction beyond pattern recognition. We conclude by discussing how VisRes provides a unified framework for advancing abstract visual reasoning in multimodal research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EveryWear is a lightweight human motion capture system using everyday wearables, which eliminates calibration and uses real-world data for training to achieve high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations in traditional motion estimation methods, such as poor wearability, high costs, and calibration difficulties, by leveraging common wearables.

Method: The approach combines data from egocentric cameras in smart glasses and inertial sensors in wearables using a teacher-student framework, trained on real-world 3D motion datasets (Ego-Elec).

Result: The proposed method outperforms baseline models in full-body motion estimation, demonstrating its practicality and reliability in diverse real-world settings.

Conclusion: EveryWear showcases a practical solution for accurate motion capture using widely accessible wearables, paving the way for improved adoption in everyday life.

Abstract: While on-body device-based human motion estimation is crucial for applications such as XR interaction, existing methods often suffer from poor wearability, expensive hardware, and cumbersome calibration, which hinder their adoption in daily life. To address these challenges, we present EveryWear, a lightweight and practical human motion capture approach based entirely on everyday wearables: a smartphone, smartwatch, earbuds, and smart glasses equipped with one forward-facing and two downward-facing cameras, requiring no explicit calibration before use. We introduce Ego-Elec, a 9-hour real-world dataset covering 56 daily activities across 17 diverse indoor and outdoor environments, with ground-truth 3D annotations provided by the motion capture (MoCap), to facilitate robust research and benchmarking in this direction. Our approach employs a multimodal teacher-student framework that integrates visual cues from egocentric cameras with inertial signals from consumer devices. By training directly on real-world data rather than synthetic data, our model effectively eliminates the sim-to-real gap that constrains prior work. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models, validating its effectiveness for practical full-body motion estimation.

*Kelvin Li,Chuyi Shang,Leonid Karlinsky,Rogerio Feris,Trevor Darrell,Roei Herzig*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitation of current Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), which rely heavily on text-based reasoning, by introducing a task-agnostic approach for discovering visual reasoning tokens to enhance performance on visually demanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMMs heavily depend on text as a reasoning modality, limiting their effectiveness in handling primarily visual reasoning tasks. Existing supervised methods for adding visual reasoning steps bring challenges like reliance on restrictive priors, high annotation costs, and limited task generalization.

Method: The authors propose a task-agnostic method where LMMs discover and utilize visual reasoning tokens without explicit supervision. These tokens re-encode the image globally and adaptively for the task, avoiding the need for hand-crafted intermediate visual steps.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse vision-centric tasks, including challenges where intermediate annotations are hard to design, while also supporting multi-task instruction tuning.

Conclusion: This task-agnostic mechanism proves to generalize across tasks without explicit visual supervision, advancing the capability of LMMs to handle complex visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: While Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made significant progress, they remain largely text-centric, relying on language as their core reasoning modality. As a result, they are limited in their ability to handle reasoning tasks that are predominantly visual. Recent approaches have sought to address this by supervising intermediate visual steps with helper images, depth maps, or image crops. However, these strategies impose restrictive priors on what "useful" visual abstractions look like, add heavy annotation costs, and struggle to generalize across tasks. To address this critical limitation, we propose a task-agnostic mechanism that trains LMMs to discover and use visual reasoning tokens without explicit supervision. These tokens attend globally and re-encode the image in a task-adaptive way, enabling the model to extract relevant visual information without hand-crafted supervision. Our approach outperforms direct fine-tuning and achieves state-of-the-art results on a diverse range of vision-centric tasks -- including those where intermediate abstractions are hard to specify -- while also generalizing to multi-task instruction tuning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-stage pipeline for image retrieval using natural language queries, emphasizing event-centric entity extraction and multimodal modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to address challenges in real-world image-text retrieval including contextual variability, linguistic challenges, and the need for scalability.

Method: The pipeline uses BM25 for entity-based filtering in the first stage and BEiT-3 models for deep multimodal semantics in the second stage.

Result: The method achieved an mAP of 0.559 on the OpenEvents v1 benchmark, outperforming previous approaches.

Conclusion: Integrating event-based signals with advanced vision-language modeling enhances retrieval accuracy and efficiency for complex scenarios.

Abstract: Retrieving images from natural language descriptions is a core task at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with wide-ranging applications in search engines, media archiving, and digital content management. However, real-world image-text retrieval remains challenging due to vague or context-dependent queries, linguistic variability, and the need for scalable solutions. In this work, we propose a lightweight two-stage retrieval pipeline that leverages event-centric entity extraction to incorporate temporal and contextual signals from real-world captions. The first stage performs efficient candidate filtering using BM25 based on salient entities, while the second stage applies BEiT-3 models to capture deep multimodal semantics and rerank the results. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 benchmark, our method achieves a mean average precision of 0.559, substantially outperforming prior baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining event-guided filtering with long-text vision-language modeling for accurate and efficient retrieval in complex, real-world scenarios.

*Bowen Dang,Lin Wu,Xiaohang Yang,Zheng Yuan,Zhixiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegMo is a framework for generating 3D human motion from text, focusing on fine-grained text-motion alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of fine-grained alignment between text descriptions and motion sequences in existing methods.

Method: SegMo uses a three-module approach: Text Segment Extraction, Motion Segment Extraction, and Fine-grained Text-Motion Alignment through contrastive learning.

Result: SegMo improves upon strong baselines, achieving a TOP 1 score of 0.553 on the HumanML3D test set and supports retrieval tasks like motion grounding.

Conclusion: The proposed fine-grained alignment enhances text-to-motion generation and shows versatility in related tasks using a shared embedding space.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from textual descriptions is an important research problem with broad applications in video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality. Recent methods align the textual description with human motion at the sequence level, neglecting the internal semantic structure of modalities. However, both motion descriptions and motion sequences can be naturally decomposed into smaller and semantically coherent segments, which can serve as atomic alignment units to achieve finer-grained correspondence. Motivated by this, we propose SegMo, a novel Segment-aligned text-conditioned human Motion generation framework to achieve fine-grained text-motion alignment. Our framework consists of three modules: (1) Text Segment Extraction, which decomposes complex textual descriptions into temporally ordered phrases, each representing a simple atomic action; (2) Motion Segment Extraction, which partitions complete motion sequences into corresponding motion segments; and (3) Fine-grained Text-Motion Alignment, which aligns text and motion segments with contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SegMo improves the strong baseline on two widely used datasets, achieving an improved TOP 1 score of 0.553 on the HumanML3D test set. Moreover, thanks to the learned shared embedding space for text and motion segments, SegMo can also be applied to retrieval-style tasks such as motion grounding and motion-to-text retrieval.

TL;DR: DreaMontage is a novel framework for generating seamless, one-shot videos using advanced techniques to ensure smooth transitions and cinematic quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the prohibitive costs and real-world constraints of one-shot filmmaking, while addressing the shortcomings of current video generation approaches that lack smoothness and coherence.

Method: The authors introduced a three-dimensional approach integrating intermediate-conditioning into the DiT architecture, curating a high-quality dataset with specific training strategies, and designing a memory-efficient auto-regressive inference strategy.

Result: DreaMontage achieves visually seamless, expressive, and cohesive one-shot videos with improved computational efficiency.

Conclusion: DreaMontage provides a robust solution for virtual one-shot video creation, enabling users to produce high-quality cinematic experiences from limited visual inputs.

Abstract: The "one-shot" technique represents a distinct and sophisticated aesthetic in filmmaking. However, its practical realization is often hindered by prohibitive costs and complex real-world constraints. Although emerging video generation models offer a virtual alternative, existing approaches typically rely on naive clip concatenation, which frequently fails to maintain visual smoothness and temporal coherence. In this paper, we introduce DreaMontage, a comprehensive framework designed for arbitrary frame-guided generation, capable of synthesizing seamless, expressive, and long-duration one-shot videos from diverse user-provided inputs. To achieve this, we address the challenge through three primary dimensions. (i) We integrate a lightweight intermediate-conditioning mechanism into the DiT architecture. By employing an Adaptive Tuning strategy that effectively leverages base training data, we unlock robust arbitrary-frame control capabilities. (ii) To enhance visual fidelity and cinematic expressiveness, we curate a high-quality dataset and implement a Visual Expression SFT stage. In addressing critical issues such as subject motion rationality and transition smoothness, we apply a Tailored DPO scheme, which significantly improves the success rate and usability of the generated content. (iii) To facilitate the production of extended sequences, we design a Segment-wise Auto-Regressive (SAR) inference strategy that operates in a memory-efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves visually striking and seamlessly coherent one-shot effects while maintaining computational efficiency, empowering users to transform fragmented visual materials into vivid, cohesive one-shot cinematic experiences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robust framework for anomaly detection in brain MRI under varying and incomplete modality conditions, enhancing adaptability and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve anomaly detection in brain MRI considering the scarce abnormal case annotations and varying availability of imaging modalities in clinical settings.

Method: The method involves a dual-pathway DINOv2 encoder with feature alignment for incomplete modalities, INP-based decoder for reconstructing normal patterns, and randomized training to handle any modality configurations.

Result: The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art systems across different datasets and 7 modality configurations, demonstrating its generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: This framework presents a scalable approach for multimodal medical anomaly detection under imperfect clinical conditions.

Abstract: Reliable anomaly detection in brain MRI remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated abnormal cases and the frequent absence of key imaging modalities in real clinical workflows. Existing single-class or multi-class anomaly detection (AD) models typically rely on fixed modality configurations, require repetitive training, or fail to generalize to unseen modality combinations, limiting their clinical scalability. In this work, we present a unified Any-Modality AD framework that performs robust anomaly detection and localization under arbitrary MRI modality availability. The framework integrates a dual-pathway DINOv2 encoder with a feature distribution alignment mechanism that statistically aligns incomplete-modality features with full-modality representations, enabling stable inference even with severe modality dropout. To further enhance semantic consistency, we introduce an Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) extractor and an INP-guided decoder that reconstruct only normal anatomical patterns while naturally amplifying abnormal deviations. Through randomized modality masking and indirect feature completion during training, the model learns to adapt to all modality configurations without re-training. Extensive experiments on BraTS2018, MU-Glioma-Post, and Pretreat-MetsToBrain-Masks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art industrial and medical AD baselines across 7 modality combinations, achieving superior generalization. This study establishes a scalable paradigm for multimodal medical AD under real-world, imperfect modality conditions. Our source code is available at https://github.com/wuchangw/AnyAD.

*Weiqi Li,Zehao Zhang,Liang Lin,Guangrun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Attention-Conditional Diffusion (ACD), a method for improving controllability in video synthesis by aligning attention maps with external signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing methods for video synthesis struggle to provide accurate control over specified conditions, either relying on indirect models or external classifiers that result in adversarial artifacts.

Method: The authors propose ACD, which uses attention supervision in diffusion models, a sparse 3D-aware object layout as a conditioning signal, a Layout ControlNet, and an annotation pipeline for scalable layout integration.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate enhanced alignment with input conditions, improved temporal coherence, and maintained visual fidelity.

Conclusion: The ACD framework establishes a new and effective approach to achieve controllable and high-quality conditional video synthesis.

Abstract: Controllability is a fundamental requirement in video synthesis, where accurate alignment with conditioning signals is essential. Existing classifier-free guidance methods typically achieve conditioning indirectly by modeling the joint distribution of data and conditions, which often results in limited controllability over the specified conditions. Classifier-based guidance enforces conditions through an external classifier, but the model may exploit this mechanism to raise the classifier score without genuinely satisfying the intended condition, resulting in adversarial artifacts and limited effective controllability. In this paper, we propose Attention-Conditional Diffusion (ACD), a novel framework for direct conditional control in video diffusion models via attention supervision. By aligning the model's attention maps with external control signals, ACD achieves better controllability. To support this, we introduce a sparse 3D-aware object layout as an efficient conditioning signal, along with a dedicated Layout ControlNet and an automated annotation pipeline for scalable layout integration. Extensive experiments on benchmark video generation datasets demonstrate that ACD delivers superior alignment with conditioning inputs while preserving temporal coherence and visual fidelity, establishing an effective paradigm for conditional video synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores improving generative modeling of image sequences by factorizing generation into low-resolution coarse sequences followed by high-resolution refinement using Diffusion Transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inefficiencies in the current state-of-the-art methods for generating image sequences, focusing on enhancing synthesis quality, coherence, and efficiency.

Method: The authors propose a two-step generative approach: (1) generating low-resolution image sequences using Diffusion Transformer to capture frame correlations, and (2) super-resolving individual frames for high-resolution details.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior synthesis quality, better sequence coherence, arbitrary-length sequence generation, and twice-as-fast inference speed compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generative modeling of image sequences across datasets with enhanced quality, speed, and generalization.

Abstract: Modern deep learning methods typically treat image sequences as large tensors of sequentially stacked frames. However, is this straightforward representation ideal given the current state-of-the-art (SoTA)? In this work, we address this question in the context of generative models and aim to devise a more effective way of modeling image sequence data. Observing the inefficiencies and bottlenecks of current SoTA image sequence generation methods, we showcase that rather than working with large tensors, we can improve the generation process by factorizing it into first generating the coarse sequence at low resolution and then refining the individual frames at high resolution. We train a generative model solely on grid images comprising subsampled frames. Yet, we learn to generate image sequences, using the strong self-attention mechanism of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to capture correlations between frames. In effect, our formulation extends a 2D image generator to operate as a low-resolution 3D image-sequence generator without introducing any architectural modifications. Subsequently, we super-resolve each frame individually to add the sequence-independent high-resolution details. This approach offers several advantages and can overcome key limitations of the SoTA in this domain. Compared to existing image sequence generation models, our method achieves superior synthesis quality and improved coherence across sequences. It also delivers high-fidelity generation of arbitrary-length sequences and increased efficiency in inference time and training data usage. Furthermore, our straightforward formulation enables our method to generalize effectively across diverse data domains, which typically require additional priors and supervision to model in a generative context. Our method consistently outperforms SoTA in quality and inference speed (at least twice-as-fast) across datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpikeSurgSeg, a real-time, spike-driven video Transformer for efficient surgical scene segmentation, addressing challenges of computational demands and limited labeled surgical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable intelligent, efficient, real-time surgical scene segmentation in resource-constrained surgical environments, overcoming the limitations of computationally intensive deep learning models and scarcity of labeled data.

Method: Proposed SpikeSurgSeg framework uses a spike-driven video Transformer, novel surgical-scene masked autoencoding pretraining for spatiotemporal representation learning, and a lightweight spike-driven segmentation head for efficiency.

Result: SpikeSurgSeg achieves mIoU accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art ANN-based models while reducing inference latency by 8× and achieving 20× acceleration compared to foundation-model baselines.

Conclusion: SpikeSurgSeg is a promising solution for efficient, low-latency surgical scene segmentation, suitable for time-critical, resource-limited surgical environments.

Abstract: Modern surgical systems increasingly rely on intelligent scene understanding to provide timely situational awareness for enhanced intra-operative safety. Within this pipeline, surgical scene segmentation plays a central role in accurately perceiving operative events. Although recent deep learning models, particularly large-scale foundation models, achieve remarkable segmentation accuracy, their substantial computational demands and power consumption hinder real-time deployment in resource-constrained surgical environments. To address this limitation, we explore the emerging SNN as a promising paradigm for highly efficient surgical intelligence. However, their performance is still constrained by the scarcity of labeled surgical data and the inherently sparse nature of surgical video representations. To this end, we propose \textit{SpikeSurgSeg}, the first spike-driven video Transformer framework tailored for surgical scene segmentation with real-time potential on non-GPU platforms. To address the limited availability of surgical annotations, we introduce a surgical-scene masked autoencoding pretraining strategy for SNNs that enables robust spatiotemporal representation learning via layer-wise tube masking. Building on this pretrained backbone, we further adopt a lightweight spike-driven segmentation head that produces temporally consistent predictions while preserving the low-latency characteristics of SNNs. Extensive experiments on EndoVis18 and our in-house SurgBleed dataset demonstrate that SpikeSurgSeg achieves mIoU comparable to SOTA ANN-based models while reducing inference latency by at least $8\times$. Notably, it delivers over $20\times$ acceleration relative to most foundation-model baselines, underscoring its potential for time-critical surgical scene segmentation.

TL;DR: The paper develops a method using multi-scale signal-processing for improved detection of table segment boundaries in noisy or low-resolution images, resulting in better structured data extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with accurately identifying table boundaries, particularly for noisy or low-resolution images, with current transformer-based or mask-based approaches facing limitations like computational cost, noise sensitivity, or resolution issues.

Method: A novel processing workflow is introduced, where row and column transitions are modeled as 1D signals. Gaussian convolution and statistical thresholding suppress noise while maintaining structural edges, mapping signal peaks back to image coordinates for accurate segmentation.

Result: The proposed method increased Cell-Aware Segmentation Accuracy (CASA) on the PubLayNet-1M benchmark from 67% to 76% when integrated with TableNet and PyTesseract OCR, showing robustness to image variations and optimized tabular outputs.

Conclusion: The multi-scale signal-processing method effectively improves table edge detection and tabular data structuring from images, proving useful for noisy and low-resolution input scenarios.

Abstract: Structured data extraction from tables plays a crucial role in document image analysis for scanned documents and digital archives. Although many methods have been proposed to detect table structures and extract cell contents, accurately identifying table segment boundaries (rows and columns) remains challenging, particularly in low-resolution or noisy images. In many real-world scenarios, table data are incomplete or degraded, limiting the adaptability of transformer-based methods to noisy inputs. Mask-based edge detection techniques have shown greater robustness under such conditions, as their sensitivity can be adjusted through threshold tuning; however, existing approaches typically apply masks directly to images, leading to noise sensitivity, resolution loss, or high computational cost. This paper proposes a novel multi-scale signal-processing method for detecting table edges from table masks. Row and column transitions are modeled as one-dimensional signals and processed using Gaussian convolution with progressively increasing variances, followed by statistical thresholding to suppress noise while preserving stable structural edges. Detected signal peaks are mapped back to image coordinates to obtain accurate segment boundaries. Experimental results show that applying the proposed approach to column edge detection improves Cell-Aware Segmentation Accuracy (CASA) a layout-aware metric evaluating both textual correctness and correct cell placement from 67% to 76% on the PubLayNet-1M benchmark when using TableNet with PyTesseract OCR. The method is robust to resolution variations through zero-padding and scaling strategies and produces optimized structured tabular outputs suitable for downstream analysis.

Motivation: Existing approaches for evaluating mobile GUI agents are limited to simple applications and basic metrics, overlooking real-world task complexity.

Method: AndroidLens provides a benchmark with 571 long-latency tasks, static evaluation for anomaly considerations, and dynamic evaluation using milestone-based Average Task Progress.

Result: The best performing models achieve only a 12.7% task success rate and 50.47% ATP, highlighting challenges in adaptive exploration and memory retention.

Conclusion: AndroidLens demonstrates substantial gaps in current mobile GUI agent capabilities and outlines challenges for future improvement.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents can substantially improve productivity by automating frequently executed long-latency tasks on mobile devices. However, existing evaluation benchmarks are still constrained to limited applications, simple tasks, and coarse-grained metrics. To address this, we introduce AndroidLens, a challenging evaluation framework for mobile GUI agents, comprising 571 long-latency tasks in both Chinese and English environments, each requiring an average of more than 26 steps to complete. The framework features: (1) tasks derived from real-world user scenarios across 38 domains, covering complex types such as multi-constraint, multi-goal, and domain-specific tasks; (2) static evaluation that preserves real-world anomalies and allows multiple valid paths to reduce bias; and (3) dynamic evaluation that employs a milestone-based scheme for fine-grained progress measurement via Average Task Progress (ATP). Our evaluation indicates that even the best models reach only a 12.7% task success rate and 50.47% ATP. We also underscore key challenges in real-world environments, including environmental anomalies, adaptive exploration, and long-term memory retention.

Method: TICON employs a shared transformer encoder pretrained with a masked modeling objective to contextualize embeddings from existing tile-level models.

Result: TICON achieves state-of-the-art results on various tile-level and slide-level benchmarks, outperforming models trained on significantly larger datasets.

Conclusion: TICON effectively enhances pathology-specific applications, offering a universal and efficient solution for both local and global analysis in computational pathology.

Abstract: The interpretation of small tiles in large whole slide images (WSI) often needs a larger image context. We introduce TICON, a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that produces rich, contextualized embeddings for ''any'' application in computational pathology. Standard tile encoder-based pipelines, which extract embeddings of tiles stripped from their context, fail to model the rich slide-level information essential for both local and global tasks. Furthermore, different tile-encoders excel at different downstream tasks. Therefore, a unified model is needed to contextualize embeddings derived from ''any'' tile-level foundation model. TICON addresses this need with a single, shared encoder, pretrained using a masked modeling objective to simultaneously unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate that TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many different tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (i.e., HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (i.e., Patho-Bench). Finally, we pretrain an aggregator on TICON to form a slide-level foundation model, using only 11K WSIs, outperforming SoTA slide-level foundation models pretrained with up to 350K WSIs.

### [126] [Fast SAM2 with Text-Driven Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21333)
*Avilasha Mandal,Chaoning Zhang,Fachrina Dewi Puspitasari,Xudong Wang,Jiaquan Zhang,Caiyan Qin,Guoqing Wang,Yang Yang,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a token pruning framework to improve the efficiency of SAM2 in video object segmentation by reducing token density before temporal propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational and memory cost of propagating dense visual tokens in SAM2 pipelines limits their scalability and practical deployment.

Method: Introducing a text-guided token pruning framework that ranks and selects tokens based on visual context, semantics from textual descriptions, and uncertainty cues without altering the segmentation architecture.

Result: The approach achieves up to 42.50% faster inference and 37.41% lower GPU memory usage while preserving competitive segmentation performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Token pruning improves the efficiency and scalability of SAM2, enabling real-time applications with reduced resource consumption.

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), a vision foundation model has significantly advanced in prompt-driven video object segmentation, yet their practical deployment remains limited by the high computational and memory cost of processing dense visual tokens across time. The SAM2 pipelines typically propagate all visual tokens produced by the image encoder through downstream temporal reasoning modules, regardless of their relevance to the target object, resulting in reduced scalability due to quadratic memory attention overhead. In this work, we introduce a text-guided token pruning framework that improves inference efficiency by selectively reducing token density prior to temporal propagation, without modifying the underlying segmentation architecture. Operating after visual encoding and before memory based propagation, our method ranks tokens using a lightweight routing mechanism that integrates local visual context, semantic relevance derived from object-centric textual descriptions (either user-provided or automatically generated), and uncertainty cues that help preserve ambiguous or boundary critical regions. By retaining only the most informative tokens for downstream processing, the proposed approach reduces redundant computation while maintaining segmentation fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging video segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that post-encoder token pruning provides a practical and effective pathway to efficient, prompt-aware video segmentation, achieving up to 42.50 percent faster inference and 37.41 percent lower GPU memory usage compared to the unpruned baseline SAM2, while preserving competitive J and F performance. These results highlight the potential of early token selection to improve the scalability of transformer-based video segmentation systems for real-time and resource-constrained applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video models are limited in scope, focusing narrowly on tasks like question answering or captioning and lacking broad capabilities for real-time streaming tasks.

Method: The paper introduces Streamo-Instruct-465K, a diverse instruction-following dataset, which enables training Streamo on multi-task supervision for streaming video tasks.

Result: Streamo demonstrates strong temporal reasoning and generalization across streaming benchmarks, bridging the gap between offline video models and real-time assistants.

Conclusion: Streamo moves toward unified, intelligent video understanding in continuous streams, pushing boundaries in real-time interaction and versatility.

Abstract: We present Streamo, a real-time streaming video LLM that serves as a general-purpose interactive assistant. Unlike existing online video models that focus narrowly on question answering or captioning, Streamo performs a broad spectrum of streaming video tasks, including real-time narration, action understanding, event captioning, temporal event grounding, and time-sensitive question answering. To develop such versatility, we construct Streamo-Instruct-465K, a large-scale instruction-following dataset tailored for streaming video understanding. The dataset covers diverse temporal contexts and multi-task supervision, enabling unified training across heterogeneous streaming tasks. After training end-to-end on the instruction-following dataset through a streamlined pipeline, Streamo exhibits strong temporal reasoning, responsive interaction, and broad generalization across a variety of streaming benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that Streamo bridges the gap between offline video perception models and real-time multimodal assistants, making a step toward unified, intelligent video understanding in continuous video streams.

### [128] [Beyond Memorization: A Multi-Modal Ordinal Regression Benchmark to Expose Popularity Bias in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21337)
*Li-Zhong Szu-Tu,Ting-Lin Wu,Chia-Jui Chang,He Syu,Yu-Lun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study identifies a popularity bias in vision-language models (VLMs), revealing a reliance on memorization rather than general understanding. A new benchmark dataset, YearGuessr, measures this performance gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the observed bias in VLMs where the models perform significantly better on popular, well-known items, undermining their general reasoning capabilities.

Method: The paper presents the YearGuessr dataset comprising 55,546 building images with annotations such as construction years, GPS data, and page-view counts. It frames the prediction task as ordinal regression and implements novel metrics to evaluate popularity bias.

Result: The benchmark of 30+ models, including the proposed YearCLIP, demonstrates that VLMs perform well on memorized data but struggle with less popular, unrecognized items, highlighting their limitations.

Conclusion: VLMs exhibit critical flaws in reasoning due to their reliance on memorization of popular data. This calls for enhanced model development to address this bias and promote generalizable understanding.

Abstract: We expose a significant popularity bias in state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), which achieve up to 34% higher accuracy on famous buildings compared to ordinary ones, indicating a reliance on memorization over generalizable understanding. To systematically investigate this, we introduce the largest open benchmark for this task: the YearGuessr dataset, a collection of 55,546 building images with multi-modal attributes from 157 countries, annotated with continuous ordinal labels of their construction year (1001-2024), GPS data, and page-view counts as a proxy for popularity. Using this dataset, we frame the construction year prediction task as ordinal regression and introduce popularity-aware interval accuracy metrics to quantify this bias. Our resulting benchmark of 30+ models, including our YearCLIP model, confirms that VLMs excel on popular, memorized items but struggle significantly with unrecognized subjects, exposing a critical flaw in their reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes HiStream, an efficient framework for high-resolution video generation, significantly reducing computational redundancy and achieving faster performance with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of diffusion models limits practical inference for high-resolution video generation, creating a need for an efficient and scalable solution.

Method: HiStream reduces redundancy through spatial, temporal, and timestep compression strategies, including denoising at low resolution, chunk-by-chunk processing, and fewer denoising steps for cached chunks.

Result: HiStream achieves up to 76.2x faster denoising with minimal quality loss compared to the baseline. HiStream+ further improves speed with 107.5x acceleration while balancing quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: The HiStream framework transforms high-resolution video generation into a practical and scalable task, offering a balance between speed and visual quality.

Abstract: High-resolution video generation, while crucial for digital media and film, is computationally bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of diffusion models, making practical inference infeasible. To address this, we introduce HiStream, an efficient autoregressive framework that systematically reduces redundancy across three axes: i) Spatial Compression: denoising at low resolution before refining at high resolution with cached features; ii) Temporal Compression: a chunk-by-chunk strategy with a fixed-size anchor cache, ensuring stable inference speed; and iii) Timestep Compression: applying fewer denoising steps to subsequent, cache-conditioned chunks. On 1080p benchmarks, our primary HiStream model (i+ii) achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while demonstrating up to 76.2x faster denoising compared to the Wan2.1 baseline and negligible quality loss. Our faster variant, HiStream+, applies all three optimizations (i+ii+iii), achieving a 107.5x acceleration over the baseline, offering a compelling trade-off between speed and quality, thereby making high-resolution video generation both practical and scalable.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: RHAPSODY is a middleware designed for hybrid AI-HPC workflows, enabling concurrent execution of diverse tasks and cutting-edge scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid AI-HPC workflows encounter challenges due to varied and conflicting runtime system requirements. Current systems fail to accommodate these diverse needs comprehensively.

Method: RHAPSODY integrates a multi-runtime middleware approach that harmonizes existing runtimes for simulation, inference services, and agentic workflows within a unified job allocation.

Result: RHAPSODY demonstrated minimal runtime overhead, efficient scaling for inference workloads, and optimized coupling of HPC and AI tasks during evaluations on leadership-class HPC systems.

Conclusion: RHAPSODY provides a promising solution for supporting emerging AI-HPC applications at scale by efficiently orchestrating heterogeneous workflows.

Abstract: Hybrid AI-HPC workflows combine large-scale simulation, training, high-throughput inference, and tightly coupled, agent-driven control within a single execution campaign. These workflows impose heterogeneous and often conflicting requirements on runtime systems, spanning MPI executables, persistent AI services, fine-grained tasks, and low-latency AI-HPC coupling. Existing systems typically address only subsets of these requirements, limiting their ability to support emerging AI-HPC applications at scale. We present RHAPSODY, a multi-runtime middleware that enables concurrent execution of heterogeneous AI-HPC workloads through uniform abstractions for tasks, services, resources, and execution policies. Rather than replacing existing runtimes, RHAPSODY composes and coordinates them, allowing simulation codes, inference services, and agentic workflows to coexist within a single job allocation on leadership-class HPC platforms. We evaluate RHAPSODY with Dragon and vLLM on multiple HPC systems using representative heterogeneous, inference-at-scale, and tightly coupled AI-HPC workflows. Our results show that RHAPSODY introduces minimal runtime overhead, sustains increasing heterogeneity at scale, achieves near-linear scaling for high-throughput inference workloads, and data- and control-efficient coupling between AI and HPC tasks in agentic workflows.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a class of stochastic well-structured transition systems to incorporate probabilistic scheduling and examines their computational capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to broaden the scope of well-structured transition systems by integrating probabilistic scheduling rules to better model systems like population protocols and chemical reaction networks.

Method: The paper uses theoretical analysis to extend existing models, introduce stochastic behavior, and analyze computational properties under probabilistic rules.

Result: They demonstrate limitations of phase clocks, terminate computations in polynomial time, and differentiate computational capabilities based on system augmentations.

Conclusion: Augmented stochastic systems with ordering rules compute languages in BPP, whereas unaugmented systems handle symmetric languages in BPL, showcasing distinct computational hierarchies.

Abstract: Extending well-structured transition systems to incorporate a probabilistic scheduling rule, we define a new class of stochastic well-structured transition systems that includes population protocols, chemical reaction networks, and many common gossip models; as well as augmentations of these systems by an oracle that exposes a total order on agents as in population protocols in the comparison model or an equivalence relation as in population protocols with unordered data.
  We show that any implementation of a phase clock in these systems either stops or ticks too fast after polynomially many expected steps, and that any terminating computation in these systems finishes or fails in expected polynomial time. This latter property allows an exact characterization of the computational power of many stochastic well-structured transition systems augmented with a total order or equivalence relation on agents, showing that these compute exactly the languages in BPP, while the corresponding unaugmented systems compute just the symmetric languages in BPL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of large language models and GPU advancements necessitate effective distributed training solutions for heterogeneous GPU setups.

Method: The authors analyze the challenges of 3D parallelism and introduce AutoHet, which adopts asymmetric 3D parallelism and fine-grained workload distribution. They use an optimization model to address device grouping and load balancing.

Result: AutoHet outperforms Megatron-LM and Whale by up to 1.79× in training throughput and improves recovery speed by 4.38× over baseline spot instance systems.

Conclusion: AutoHet effectively optimizes distributed training in heterogeneous GPU environments, enhancing training speed and recovery performance while addressing significant challenges like load balancing and elastic training.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) and the continuous release of new GPU products have significantly increased the demand for distributed training across heterogeneous GPU environments. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the challenges involved in implementing 3D parallelism in such environments, addressing critical issues such as the need for symmetric tensor parallelism, efficient gradient synchronization in asymmetric pipeline parallelism, and the trade-offs between memory utilization and computational efficiency. Building upon these insights, we introduce AutoHet, a novel system that automatically identifies the optimal parallelism plan for distributed training on heterogeneous GPUs. AutoHet supports asymmetric 3D parallelism structures and facilitates fine-grained workload distribution. We propose a theoretical model that frames the device grouping and load balancing as an optimization problem to minimize per-iteration training time, thus effectively balancing computing power and memory usage across GPUs with diverse capabilities. To enable elastic training upon spot instance preemption, AutoHet presents an efficient recovery strategy that prioritizes to retrieve training states from local nodes, and only downloads the missing checkpoints from the cloud storage. Our extensive evaluation, conducted on three large-scale models and utilizing combinations of three different GPU types, demonstrates that AutoHet outperforms existing DNN training systems, achieving up to a 1.79$\times$ speedup in training throughput compared with Megatron-LM and Whale, and a 4.38$\times$ speedup of recovery speed compared to a spot instance baseline.

*Linggao Kong,Yuedong Xu,Lei Jiao,Chuan Xu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of fine-tuning large foundation models cost-effectively by leveraging both spot and on-demand GPU instances. The proposed online algorithms adapt to volatile spot market conditions and improve utility by up to 54.8%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling foundation models increases fine-tuning costs significantly. Utilizing low-cost GPU spot instances, whose prices and availability vary, requires strategies for deadline-aware and cost-efficient scheduling.

Method: The paper formulates an integer programming problem to handle spot and on-demand GPU instances under price and availability fluctuations. It introduces an online allocation algorithm with predictive elements and a non-predictive complementary algorithm. A policy selection algorithm dynamically learns the best-performing policy across varying market and prediction scenarios.

Result: The proposed framework achieves dynamic, cost-efficient scheduling, adapts to market dynamics, and achieves up to 54.8% improvement in utility compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: By combining prediction-based and non-predictive algorithms with adaptive online policy selection, the framework ensures robust and cost-effective fine-tuning under unpredictable GPU instance dynamics.

Abstract: As foundation models grow in size, fine-tuning them becomes increasingly expensive. While GPU spot instances offer a low-cost alternative to on-demand resources, their volatile prices and availability make deadline-aware scheduling particularly challenging. We tackle this difficulty by using a mix of spot and on-demand instances. Distinctively, we show the predictability of prices and availability in a spot instance market, the power of prediction in enabling cost-efficient scheduling and its sensitivity to estimation errors. An integer programming problem is formulated to capture the use of mixed instances under both the price and availability dynamics. We propose an online allocation algorithm with prediction based on the committed horizon control approach that leverages a \emph{commitment level} to enforce the partial sequence of decisions. When this prediction becomes inaccurate, we further present a complementary online algorithm without predictions. An online policy selection algorithm is developed that learns the best policy from a pool constructed by varying the parameters of both algorithms. We prove that the prediction-based algorithm achieves tighter performance bounds as prediction error decreases, while the policy selection algorithm possesses a regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$. Experimental results demonstrate that our online framework can adaptively select the best policy under varying spot market dynamics and prediction quality, consistently outperforming baselines and improving utility by up to 54.8\%.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mesh-Attention, a new distributed attention algorithm for LLMs that improves scalability by reducing communication traffic, achieving up to 3.4x speedup and 85.4% communication volume reduction in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address scalability limitations in distributed attention for LLMs, as existing methods like Ring-Attention are hindered by excessive communication traffic.

Method: Mesh-Attention redefines distributed attention with a matrix-based model, using two-dimensional computation tiles and a greedy scheduling algorithm to optimize communication efficiency among GPUs.

Result: Mesh-Attention achieves up to 3.4x speedup and reduces communication volume by up to 85.4% on large-scale systems with 256 GPUs, showcasing its enhanced performance.

Conclusion: Mesh-Attention is a scalable and efficient alternative to existing distributed attention methods, making it suitable for large-scale LLM deployments by achieving superior communication-computation balance and scalability.

Abstract: Distributed attention is a fundamental problem for scaling context window for Large Language Models (LLMs). The state-of-the-art method, Ring-Attention, suffers from scalability limitations due to its excessive communication traffic. This paper proposes a new distributed attention algorithm, Mesh-Attention, by rethinking the design space of distributed attention with a new matrix-based model. Our method assigns a two-dimensional tile -- rather than one-dimensional row or column -- of computation blocks to each GPU to achieve higher efficiency through lower communication-computation (CommCom) ratio. The general approach covers Ring-Attention as a special case, and allows the tuning of CommCom ratio with different tile shapes. Importantly, we propose a greedy algorithm that can efficiently search the scheduling space within the tile with restrictions that ensure efficient communication among GPUs. The theoretical analysis shows that Mesh-Attention leads to a much lower communication complexity and exhibits good scalability comparing to other current algorithms.
  Our extensive experiment results show that Mesh-Attention can achieve up to 3.4x speedup (2.9x on average) and reduce the communication volume by up to 85.4% (79.0% on average) on 256 GPUs. Our scalability results further demonstrate that Mesh-Attention sustains superior performance as the system scales, substantially reducing overhead in large-scale deployments. The results convincingly confirm the advantage of Mesh-Attention.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Hypergraphs effectively model complex networks with higher-order interactions, but analyzing dynamic properties such as triad counts is computationally challenging. ESCHER, a GPU-based solution, addresses this by efficiently managing hypergraph evolution and triad counting tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional graph models cannot sufficiently capture intricate group interaction patterns within large and dynamic networks, leading to the need for hypergraph-based computational tools.

Method: The researchers developed ESCHER, a GPU-centric parallel data structure, alongside a triad-count framework. This minimizes redundant computation and leverages dynamic update capabilities.

Result: Empirical testing on various datasets shows ESCHER achieves significant speedups (up to 104.5x, 473.7x, and 112.5x) compared to existing methods across triad categories.

Conclusion: ESCHER successfully addresses computational challenges in analyzing dynamic large-scale hypergraphs, proving to be a highly efficient and scalable solution.

Abstract: Higher-order interactions beyond pairwise relationships in large complex networks are often modeled as hypergraphs. Analyzing hypergraph properties such as triad counts is essential, as hypergraphs can reveal intricate group interaction patterns that conventional graphs fail to capture. In real-world scenarios, these networks are often large and dynamic, introducing significant computational challenges. Due to the absence of specialized software packages and data structures, the analysis of large dynamic hypergraphs remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this gap, we propose ESCHER, a GPU-centric parallel data structure for Efficient and Scalable Hypergraph Evolution Representation, designed to manage large scale hypergraph dynamics efficiently. We also design a hypergraph triad-count update framework that minimizes redundant computation while fully leveraging the capabilities of ESCHER for dynamic operations. We validate the efficacy of our approach across multiple categories of hypergraph triad counting, including hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triads. Empirical results on both large real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving speedups of up to 104.5x, 473.7x, and 112.5x for hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triad types, respectively.

### [137] [Learning Evolving Latent Strategies for Multi-Agent Language Systems without Model Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20629)
*Wenlong Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-agent language framework for strategy evolution through an external latent space, bypassing direct parameter fine-tuning of the language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current strategies in language models often rely on static representation or fine-tuning, limiting adaptability and scalability in dynamic or multi-round interactions.

Method: The study proposes a dual-loop architecture: a behavior loop adjusts actions using environmental rewards, and a language loop updates external latent vectors based on semantic reflections from generated texts.

Result: The findings reveal agents developing stable, structured strategic styles over extended interactions, with clear latent space convergence and emergent abilities to adapt even to emotional agents without shared rewards.

Conclusion: Using external latent spaces without fine-tuning model parameters provides scalable and interpretable strategic adaptation for language agents, proving effective in dynamic and collaborative environments.

Abstract: This study proposes a multi-agent language framework that enables continual strategy evolution without fine-tuning the language model's parameters. The core idea is to liberate the latent vectors of abstract concepts from traditional static semantic representations, allowing them to be continuously updated through environmental interaction and reinforcement feedback. We construct a dual-loop architecture: the behavior loop adjusts action preferences based on environmental rewards, while the language loop updates the external latent vectors by reflecting on the semantic embeddings of generated text.
  Together, these mechanisms allow agents to develop stable and disentangled strategic styles over long-horizon multi-round interactions. Experiments show that agents' latent spaces exhibit clear convergence trajectories under reflection-driven updates, along with structured shifts at critical moments. Moreover, the system demonstrates an emergent ability to implicitly infer and continually adapt to emotional agents, even without shared rewards. These results indicate that, without modifying model parameters, an external latent space can provide language agents with a low-cost, scalable, and interpretable form of abstract strategic representation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the instability and drift in sentiment prediction models when applied to real-world social media data during dynamic and unpredictable events.

Method: Performed temporal drift analysis using transformer models with statistical validation and introduced four drift metrics to quantify model instability.

Result: Found drops in accuracy up to 23.4%, confidence reductions of 13.0%, and validated robust detection metrics exceeding industry thresholds.

Conclusion: The approach allows real-time drift detection in sentiment models without retraining and provides insights for improving model reliability during unpredictable events.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive zero-training temporal drift analysis of transformer-based sentiment models validated on authentic social media data from major real-world events. Through systematic evaluation across three transformer architectures and rigorous statistical validation on 12,279 authentic social media posts, we demonstrate significant model instability with accuracy drops reaching 23.4% during event-driven periods. Our analysis reveals maximum confidence drops of 13.0% (Bootstrap 95% CI: [9.1%, 16.5%]) with strong correlation to actual performance degradation. We introduce four novel drift metrics that outperform embedding-based baselines while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for production deployment. Statistical validation across multiple events confirms robust detection capabilities with practical significance exceeding industry monitoring thresholds. This zero-training methodology enables immediate deployment for real-time sentiment monitoring systems and provides new insights into transformer model behavior during dynamic content periods.

*Yuma Ichikawa,Naoya Takagi,Takumi Nakagawa,Yuzi Kanazawa,Akira Sakai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHOTON presents a new hierarchical autoregressive model structure to improve inference throughput and memory efficiency for long-context tasks compared to standard Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers face latency and memory-bound constraints during inference due to their method of scanning tokens horizontally and maintaining an expanding sequence of token states.

Method: PHOTON uses a hierarchical model design with bottom-up encoding for compressing tokens into low-resolution states and top-down decoding for reconstructing token-level representations efficiently.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows PHOTON outperforms Transformer-based models in throughput-quality trade-offs, and achieves up to 1000× improvement in decode-time throughput per memory unit.

Conclusion: PHOTON presents a significant improvement for long-context decoding tasks, reducing KV-cache traffic and optimizing memory usage.

Abstract: Transformers operate as horizontal token-by-token scanners; at each generation step, the model attends to an ever-growing sequence of token-level states. This access pattern increases prefill latency and makes long-context decoding increasingly memory-bound, as KV-cache reads and writes dominate inference throughput rather than arithmetic computation. We propose Parallel Hierarchical Operation for Top-down Networks (PHOTON), a hierarchical autoregressive model that replaces flat scanning with vertical, multi-resolution context access. PHOTON maintains a hierarchy of latent streams: a bottom-up encoder progressively compresses tokens into low-rate contextual states, while lightweight top-down decoders reconstruct fine-grained token representations. Experimental results show that PHOTON is superior to competitive Transformer-based language models regarding the throughput-quality trade-off, offering significant advantages in long-context and multi-query tasks. This reduces decode-time KV-cache traffic, yielding up to $10^{3}\times$ higher throughput per unit memory.

Conclusion: Reframing LLMs as knowledge curators offers a scalable, interpretable, and practical solution for AI-driven decision-support in oncology, significantly improving predictive accuracy by enhancing the quality of semantic representation in sparse clinical data environments.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of treatment outcomes in lung cancer remains challenging due to the sparsity, heterogeneity, and contextual overload of real-world electronic health data. Traditional models often fail to capture semantic information across multimodal streams, while large-scale fine-tuning approaches are impractical in clinical workflows. We introduce a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as Goal-oriented Knowledge Curators (GKC) to convert laboratory, genomic, and medication data into high-fidelity, task-aligned features. Unlike generic embeddings, GKC produces representations tailored to the prediction objective and operates as an offline preprocessing step that integrates naturally into hospital informatics pipelines. Using a lung cancer cohort (N=184), we benchmarked GKC against expert-engineered features, direct text embeddings, and an end-to-end transformer. Our approach achieved a mean AUROC of 0.803 (95% CI: 0.799-0.807) and outperformed all baselines. An ablation study further confirmed the complementary value of combining all three modalities. These results show that the quality of semantic representation is a key determinant of predictive accuracy in sparse clinical data settings. By reframing LLMs as knowledge curation engines rather than black-box predictors, this work demonstrates a scalable, interpretable, and workflow-compatible pathway for advancing AI-driven decision support in oncology.

### [141] [Real Time Detection and Quantitative Analysis of Spurious Forgetting in Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20634)
*Weiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses catastrophic forgetting in large language models by introducing a framework to measure and mitigate shallow task alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address performance degradation in large language models due to task alignment disruption, which causes spurious forgetting.

Method: Introduced a shallow versus deep alignment framework, offering metrics to quantify alignment, detection methods, analysis tools, and adaptive mitigation strategies.

Result: Experiments demonstrate 86.2-90.6% accuracy in identifying shallow alignment, with improved robustness against forgetting by 3.3-7.1%.

Conclusion: Enhancing task alignment depth is critical to reducing forgetting and improving model performance, supported by quantitative metrics and adaptive techniques.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a fundamental challenge in continual learning for large language models. Recent work revealed that performance degradation may stem from spurious forgetting caused by task alignment disruption rather than true knowledge loss. However, this work only qualitatively describes alignment, relies on post-hoc analysis, and lacks automatic distinction mechanisms.
  We introduce the shallow versus deep alignment framework, providing the first quantitative characterization of alignment depth. We identify that current task alignment approaches suffer from shallow alignment - maintained only over the first few output tokens (approximately 3-5) - making models vulnerable to forgetting. This explains why spurious forgetting occurs, why it is reversible, and why fine-tuning attacks are effective.
  We propose a comprehensive framework addressing all gaps: (1) quantitative metrics (0-1 scale) to measure alignment depth across token positions; (2) real-time detection methods for identifying shallow alignment during training; (3) specialized analysis tools for visualization and recovery prediction; and (4) adaptive mitigation strategies that automatically distinguish forgetting types and promote deep alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures (Qwen2.5-3B to Qwen2.5-32B) demonstrate 86.2-90.6% identification accuracy and show that promoting deep alignment improves robustness against forgetting by 3.3-7.1% over baselines.

### [142] [Managing the Stochastic: Foundations of Learning in Neuro-Symbolic Systems for Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20660)
*Matthew Thompson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework, treating Large Language Models (LLMs) as part of the environment rather than decision-making agents, to improve reliability in code generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the limitations of current AI coding agents, which blend LLM decision-making with system design, leading to failures like gaming tests and hallucinating syntax.

Method: The authors propose a Dual-State Architecture, separating deterministic workflow state from stochastic environment state, with Atomic Action Pairs and Guard Functions ensuring robust verification processes.

Result: The framework was tested on three code generation tasks across 13 LLMs, significantly improving task success rates by up to 66 percentage points with moderate increases in computational costs.

Conclusion: Architectural design constraints, rather than larger parameter scales, can improve the reliability and effectiveness of code generation by leveraging deterministic control and stochastic creativity.

Abstract: Current approaches to AI coding agents appear to blur the lines between the Large Language Model (LLM) and the agent itself, asking the LLM to make decisions best left to deterministic processes. This leads to systems prone to stochastic failures such as gaming unit tests or hallucinating syntax. Drawing on established software engineering practices that provide deterministic frameworks for managing unpredictable processes, this paper proposes setting the control boundary such that the LLM is treated as a component of the environment environment -- preserving its creative stochasticity -- rather than the decision-making agent.
  A \textbf{Dual-State Architecture} is formalized, separating workflow state (deterministic control flow) from environment state (stochastic generation). \textbf{Atomic Action Pairs} couple generation with verification as indivisible transactions, where \textbf{Guard Functions} act as sensing actions that project probabilistic outputs onto observable workflow state. The framework is validated on three code generation tasks across 13 LLMs (1.3B--15B parameters). For qualified instruction-following models, task success rates improved by up to 66 percentage points at 1.2--2.1$\times$ baseline computational cost. The results suggest that architectural constraints can substitute for parameter scale in achieving reliable code generation.

### [143] [SHRP: Specialized Head Routing and Pruning for Efficient Encoder Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20635)
*Zeli Su,Ziyin Zhang,Wenzheng Zhang,Zhou Liu,Guixian Xu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer encoders like BERT face high latency and memory issues, especially for real-time tasks. This paper introduces SHRP, a pruning framework targeting redundant attention heads, achieving substantial compression while retaining notable accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scalability and real-time deployment issues of transformer encoders by reducing their redundancy, specifically in attention modules.

Method: Proposes SHRP (Specialized Head Routing and Pruning), using Expert Attention and a unified Top-1 mechanism for structured pruning of attention heads.

Result: SHRP achieves 93% accuracy with a 48% parameter reduction on BERT while achieving extreme compression (84% accuracy, 4.2x throughput, 11.5% FLOPs) in specific scenarios.

Conclusion: SHRP effectively compresses transformer encoders, enabling scalability and real-time deployment while retaining high model performance, suitable for latency-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Transformer encoders are widely deployed in large-scale web services for natural language understanding tasks such as text classification, semantic retrieval, and content ranking. However, their high inference latency and memory consumption pose significant challenges for real-time serving and scalability. These limitations stem largely from architectural redundancy, particularly in the attention module. The inherent parameter redundancy of the attention mechanism, coupled with the fact that its attention heads operate with a degree of independence, makes it particularly amenable to structured model compression. In this paper, we propose SHRP (Specialized Head Routing and Pruning), a novel structured pruning framework that automatically identifies and removes redundant attention heads while preserving most of the model's accuracy and compatibility. SHRP introduces Expert Attention, a modular design that treats each attention head as an independent expert, followed by a lightweight shared expander feed-forward network that refines their outputs. The framework employs a unified Top-1 usage-driven mechanism to jointly perform dynamic routing during training and deterministic pruning at deployment. Experimental results on the GLUE benchmark using a BERT-base encoder show that SHRP achieves 93% of the original model accuracy while reducing parameters by 48 percent. Under an extreme compression scenario where 11/12 of the layers are pruned, the model still maintains 84% accuracy and delivers a 4.2x throughput gain while reducing computation to as low as 11.5 percent of the original FLOPs, demonstrating its practical utility for large-scale and latency-sensitive web deployments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FEM-Bench is a new benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of language models to generate finite element method (FEM) and scientific code, highlighting gaps in performance and establishing a foundation for tracking advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of rigorous benchmarks for assessing the ability of language models to generate scientifically valid physical models, particularly in computational mechanics.

Method: The researchers introduce FEM-Bench, a benchmark comprising computational tasks derived from graduate-level computational mechanics to evaluate the generation of FEM and related codes by LLMs.

Result: State-of-the-art models like Gemini 3 Pro and GPT-5 show variable performance, with Gemini 3 Pro completing 30 out of 33 tasks at least once in multiple attempts, and GPT-5 achieving a 73.8% success rate in unit test writing.

Conclusion: FEM-Bench provides a structured tool for evaluating AI capabilities in scientific code generation and will evolve to incorporate more complex tasks, ensuring steady progress in this area.

Abstract: As LLMs advance their reasoning capabilities about the physical world, the absence of rigorous benchmarks for evaluating their ability to generate scientifically valid physical models has become a critical gap. Computational mechanics, which develops and applies mathematical models and numerical methods to predict the behavior of physical systems under forces, deformation, and constraints, provides an ideal foundation for structured scientific reasoning evaluation. Problems follow clear mathematical structure, enforce strict physical and numerical constraints, and support objective verification. The discipline requires constructing explicit models of physical systems and reasoning about geometry, spatial relationships, and material behavior, connecting directly to emerging AI goals in physical reasoning and world modeling. We introduce FEM-Bench, a computational mechanics benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate correct finite element method (FEM) and related code. FEM-Bench 2025 contains a suite of introductory but nontrivial tasks aligned with material from a first graduate course on computational mechanics. These tasks capture essential numerical and physical modeling challenges while representing only a small fraction of the complexity present in the discipline. Despite their simplicity, state-of-the-art LLMs do not reliably solve all of them. In a five attempt run, the best performing model at function writing, Gemini 3 Pro, completed 30/33 tasks at least once and 26/33 tasks all five times. The best performing model at unit test writing, GPT-5, had an Average Joint Success Rate of 73.8%. Other popular models showed broad performance variation. FEM-Bench establishes a structured foundation for evaluating AI-generated scientific code, and future iterations will incorporate increasingly sophisticated tasks to track progress as models evolve.

### [145] [Data-Free Pruning of Self-Attention Layers in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20636)
*Dhananjay Saikumar,Blesson Varghese*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper suggests pruning attention sublayers in large language models using a novel method called Gate-Norm, achieving faster inference with minor accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep attention layers in LLMs often mute their contribution, leaving opportunities to simplify these models without impacting performance significantly.

Method: The authors propose Gate-Norm, a weight-only criterion to rank and prune attention sublayers based on query-key coupling, requiring no additional data, fine-tuning, or extra compute.

Result: Gate-Norm successfully prunes 8–16 attention sublayers of a 13B-parameter LLaMA model, achieving up to 1.30x inference throughput improvement while maintaining accuracy within 2% across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Gate-Norm is an efficient, data-free method for compressing LLMs by removing redundant attention sublayers, offering significant speed-ups without major accuracy losses.

Abstract: Many self-attention sublayers in large language models (LLMs) can be removed with little to no loss. We attribute this to the Attention Suppression Hypothesis: during pre-training, some deep attention layers learn to mute their own contribution, leaving the residual stream and the MLP to carry the representation. We propose Gate-Norm, a one-shot, weight-only criterion that ranks attention sublayers by query--key coupling and removes the least coupled ones, requiring no calibration data, no forward passes, no fine-tuning, and no specialized kernels. On 40-layer, 13B-parameter LLaMA models, Gate-Norm prunes the model in under a second. Pruning $8$--$16$ attention sublayers yields up to $1.30\times$ higher inference throughput while keeping average zero-shot accuracy within $2\%$ of the unpruned baseline across BoolQ, RTE, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy/Challenge, and OpenBookQA. Across these settings, Gate-Norm matches data-driven pruning methods in accuracy while being $\sim 1000\times$ faster to score layers, enabling practical, data-free compression of LLMs.

*Suriya R S,Prathamesh Dinesh Joshi,Rajat Dandekar,Raj Dandekar,Sreedath Panat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study incorporates Scientific ML using Neural ODEs and UDEs to address the n-body problem in astrophysics, emphasizing efficiency and interpretability, and demonstrates UDE models require significantly less data for accurate forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine learning models for the n-body problem are data-hungry, interpretable, and fail to embed physical laws. Hence, Scientific ML frameworks using physical principles are pursued for improved forecasting.

Method: The authors utilized Scientific ML frameworks, specifically NODEs and UDEs, implemented via Julia, to model system dynamics. Synthetically noisy data were used to assess forecasting accuracy with minimal training data.

Result: UDE models were found to be significantly more data-efficient, requiring only 20% of the training data for accurate predictions, as compared to Neural ODEs, which required 90%.

Conclusion: Scientific ML frameworks, especially UDEs, offer a robust alternative for forecasting the motion of celestial bodies, addressing traditional ML’s limitations while significantly reducing data requirements.

Abstract: The n body problem, fundamental to astrophysics, simulates the motion of n bodies acting under the effect of their own mutual gravitational interactions. Traditional machine learning models that are used for predicting and forecasting trajectories are often data intensive black box models, which ignore the physical laws, thereby lacking interpretability. Whereas Scientific Machine Learning ( Scientific ML ) directly embeds the known physical laws into the machine learning framework. Through robust modelling in the Julia programming language, our method uses the Scientific ML frameworks: Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) and Universal differential equations (UDEs) to predict and forecast the system dynamics. In addition, an essential component of our analysis involves determining the forecasting breakdown point, which is the smallest possible amount of training data our models need to predict future, unseen data accurately. We employ synthetically created noisy data to simulate real-world observational limitations. Our findings indicate that the UDE model is much more data efficient, needing only 20% of data for a correct forecast, whereas the Neural ODE requires 90%.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Q-RUN, a quantum-inspired data re-uploading network that mimics quantum neural networks' advantages without requiring quantum hardware, outperforming classical models in predictive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of current quantum hardware scalability in quantum neural networks while retaining their expressive advantages.

Method: The paper proposes Q-RUN, incorporating DRQC mathematical principles into classical models to enhance neural network performance using Fourier-expressive features.

Result: Q-RUN achieves superior performance in modeling tasks, reducing error significantly (by one to three orders of magnitude in some cases) while requiring fewer parameters compared to state-of-the-art neural network layers.

Conclusion: Quantum principles can inspire improved AI designs, and Q-RUN can seamlessly enhance neural architectures as a replacement for fully connected layers.

Abstract: Data re-uploading quantum circuits (DRQC) are a key approach to implementing quantum neural networks and have been shown to outperform classical neural networks in fitting high-frequency functions. However, their practical application is limited by the scalability of current quantum hardware. In this paper, we introduce the mathematical paradigm of DRQC into classical models by proposing a quantum-inspired data re-uploading network (Q-RUN), which retains the Fourier-expressive advantages of quantum models without any quantum hardware. Experimental results demonstrate that Q-RUN delivers superior performance across both data modeling and predictive modeling tasks. Compared to the fully connected layers and the state-of-the-art neural network layers, Q-RUN reduces model parameters while decreasing error by approximately one to three orders of magnitude on certain tasks. Notably, Q-RUN can serve as a drop-in replacement for standard fully connected layers, improving the performance of a wide range of neural architectures. This work illustrates how principles from quantum machine learning can guide the design of more expressive artificial intelligence.

*Zachary Izzo,Iain Melvin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses subgroup discovery in survival analysis, focusing on improving Cox models using novel metrics and algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for subgroup discovery in Cox models fall short, necessitating better metrics and algorithms.

Method: The authors propose evaluating existing quality functions, introduce Expected Prediction Entropy (EPE) and Conditional Rank Statistics (CRS), and develop eight algorithms for subgroup discovery.

Result: Theoretical and empirical evaluations confirm the effectiveness of EPE and CRS, with improved recovery of subgroups and model performance in synthetic, real-world, and NASA jet engine data.

Conclusion: The contributions advance Cox survival analysis subgroup discovery, providing practical insights and optimizing model accuracy and fit.

Abstract: We study the problem of subgroup discovery for survival analysis, where the goal is to find an interpretable subset of the data on which a Cox model is highly accurate. Our work is the first to study this particular subgroup problem, for which we make several contributions.
  Subgroup discovery methods generally require a "quality function" in order to sift through and select the most advantageous subgroups. We first examine why existing natural choices for quality functions are insufficient to solve the subgroup discovery problem for the Cox model. To address the shortcomings of existing metrics, we introduce two technical innovations: the *expected prediction entropy (EPE)*, a novel metric for evaluating survival models which predict a hazard function; and the *conditional rank statistics (CRS)*, a statistical object which quantifies the deviation of an individual point to the distribution of survival times in an existing subgroup. We study the EPE and CRS theoretically and show that they can solve many of the problems with existing metrics.
  We introduce a total of eight algorithms for the Cox subgroup discovery problem. The main algorithm is able to take advantage of both the EPE and the CRS, allowing us to give theoretical correctness results for this algorithm in a well-specified setting. We evaluate all of the proposed methods empirically on both synthetic and real data. The experiments confirm our theory, showing that our contributions allow for the recovery of a ground-truth subgroup in well-specified cases, as well as leading to better model fit compared to naively fitting the Cox model to the whole dataset in practical settings. Lastly, we conduct a case study on jet engine simulation data from NASA. The discovered subgroups uncover known nonlinearities/homogeneity in the data, and which suggest design choices which have been mirrored in practice.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MaskOpt, a dataset based on real IC designs, to address inefficiencies in mask optimization methods by leveraging deep learning for context-aware mask optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome scalability and accuracy limitations in mask optimization due to challenges like diffraction, process variability, and insufficiently realistic datasets.

Method: The authors constructed a large-scale benchmark dataset called MaskOpt, derived from 45nm IC designs, preserving standard-cell hierarchy and neighboring geometries. They evaluated multiple deep learning models, comparing performance based on context sensitivity and input configurations.

Result: MaskOpt includes 104,714 metal-layer tiles and 121,952 via-layer tiles with varying context sizes. Evaluated deep learning models highlighted trade-offs, showcasing the critical role of surrounding contexts and cell-aware inputs for optimization.

Conclusion: Integration of realistic datasets like MaskOpt, emphasizing cell and context-aware data, improves mask optimization accuracy, offering benchmarks to refine deep learning methods.

Abstract: As integrated circuit (IC) dimensions shrink below the lithographic wavelength, optical lithography faces growing challenges from diffraction and process variability. Model-based optical proximity correction (OPC) and inverse lithography technique (ILT) remain indispensable but computationally expensive, requiring repeated simulations that limit scalability. Although deep learning has been applied to mask optimization, existing datasets often rely on synthetic layouts, disregard standard-cell hierarchy, and neglect the surrounding contexts around the mask optimization targets, thereby constraining their applicability to practical mask optimization. To advance deep learning for cell- and context-aware mask optimization, we present MaskOpt, a large-scale benchmark dataset constructed from real IC designs at the 45$\mathrm{nm}$ node. MaskOpt includes 104,714 metal-layer tiles and 121,952 via-layer tiles. Each tile is clipped at a standard-cell placement to preserve cell information, exploiting repeated logic gate occurrences. Different context window sizes are supported in MaskOpt to capture the influence of neighboring shapes from optical proximity effects. We evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning models for IC mask optimization to build up benchmarks, and the evaluation results expose distinct trade-offs across baseline models. Further context size analysis and input ablation studies confirm the importance of both surrounding geometries and cell-aware inputs in achieving accurate mask generation.

### [150] [Understanding Scaling Laws in Deep Neural Networks via Feature Learning Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21075)
*Zihan Yao,Ruoyu Wu,Tianxiang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses feature-learning dynamics in deep learning models, introducing Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets to explain training stability and scaling behaviors. It proposes a depth-aware learning-rate correction to mitigate feature-learning collapse in deeper networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning scaling laws offer predictions for improved performance with increased model size, data, and computing power. However, these laws fail to explain training instability and diminishing returns in large models. A deeper understanding of feature learning dynamics at infinite depth and width is needed.

Method: The authors derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for single-layer residual block ResNets at infinite depth and width. They analyze the collapse in feature learning for deeper models, introduce a vanishing mechanism with residual scaling, and propose corrections to avoid feature-learning collapse in-depth settings.

Result: NFD explains when scaling succeeds and diminishes, proving certain assumptions valid at infinite depth, revealing structural reasons for failed depth-muP, and introducing an effective learning-rate correction that enhances ResNet performance in deep scenarios.

Conclusion: This work fills gaps in understanding feature-learning dynamics in deep models, especially for deeper ResNets. The depth-aware correction restores hyperparameter scaling functionality and achieves stronger model performance, providing insights into scaling optimization.

Abstract: The empirical success of deep learning is often attributed to scaling laws that predict consistent gains as model, data, and compute grow; however, large models can exhibit training instability and diminishing returns, suggesting that scaling laws describe what success looks like but not when and why scaling succeeds or fails. A central obstacle is the lack of a rigorous understanding of feature learning at large depth. While muP characterizes feature-learning dynamics in the infinite-width limit and enables hyperparameter transfer across width, its depth extension (depth-muP) breaks down for residual blocks with more than one internal layer. We derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets with single-layer residual blocks, characterizing feature learning via a coupled forward-backward stochastic system in the joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. In this regime, NFD identifies when scaling-law trends persist and explains diminishing returns. It also reveals a vanishing mechanism induced by the 1/sqrt(depth) residual scaling under which the gradient-independence assumption (GIA), known to fail during training at finite depth, becomes provably valid again at infinite depth, yielding an analytically tractable regime for end-to-end feature learning. Motivated by this insight, we study two-layer residual blocks and show that the same mechanism causes feature-learning collapse in the first internal layer at large depth, providing a structural explanation for the empirical failure of depth-muP. Based on this diagnosis, we propose a depth-aware learning-rate correction that counteracts the collapse and empirically restores depth-wise hyperparameter transfer, yielding stronger performance in deeper ResNets.

*Hayeon Jeong,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the Dominant-vs-Dominated (DvD) imbalance in text-to-image diffusion models, where one token in multi-concept prompts suppresses others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reliability and control of text-to-image generation by systematically studying the causes of the DvD imbalance.

Method: The researchers introduce DominanceBench, explore architectural and data causes for DvD, analyze cross-attention dynamics, and perform head ablation studies.

Result: DvD imbalance arises due to training data limitations and distributed attention mechanisms across multiple heads.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into generative collapse and paves the way for more balanced text-to-image generation models.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have drawn significant attention for their ability to generate diverse and high-fidelity images. However, when generating from multi-concept prompts, one concept token often dominates the generation, suppressing the others-a phenomenon we term the Dominant-vs-Dominated (DvD) imbalance. To systematically analyze this imbalance, we introduce DominanceBench and examine its causes from both data and architectural perspectives. Through various experiments, we show that the limited instance diversity in training data exacerbates the inter-concept interference. Analysis of cross-attention dynamics further reveals that dominant tokens rapidly saturate attention, progressively suppressing others across diffusion timesteps. In addition, head ablation studies show that the DvD behavior arises from distributed attention mechanisms across multiple heads. Our findings provide key insights into generative collapse, advancing toward more reliable and controllable text-to-image generation.

*Paul Caillon,Alex Colagrande,Erwan Fagnou,Blaise Delattre,Alexandre Allauzen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of traditional backpropagation by introducing a novel forward-only training algorithm called FOTON, capable of training deep neural networks without a backward pass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing computational cost of traditional backpropagation in training neural networks motivated the search for more scalable alternatives.

Method: The paper analyzes the limitations of prior forward-only approaches and designs a forward-only algorithm equivalent to backpropagation under certain assumptions, introducing FOTON by relaxing the linear assumption.

Result: FOTON outperforms previous frameworks like PEPITA, trains neural networks of any depth without a backward pass, and demonstrates potential for applications in convolutional networks.

Conclusion: The FOTON framework provides a more efficient training method for deep neural networks and opens possibilities for broader applications in advanced architectures.

Abstract: Backpropagation is still the de facto algorithm used today to
  train neural networks.
  With the exponential growth of recent architectures, the
  computational cost of this algorithm also becomes a burden. The
  recent PEPITA and forward-only frameworks have proposed promising
  alternatives, but they failed to scale up to a handful of hidden
  layers, yet limiting their use.
  In this paper, we first analyze theoretically the main limitations of
  these approaches. It allows us the design of a forward-only
  algorithm, which is equivalent to backpropagation under the linear
  and orthogonal assumptions. By relaxing the linear assumption, we
  then introduce FOTON (Forward-Only Training of Orthogonal Networks)
  that bridges the gap with the backpropagation
  algorithm. Experimental results show that it outperforms PEPITA,
  enabling us to train neural networks of any depth, without the need
  for a backward pass.
  Moreover its performance on convolutional networks clearly opens up avenues for its application to more
  advanced architectures. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/p0lcAi/FOTON .

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to generate synthetic clinical records for cardiac rehabilitation, improving data scarcity issues, classifier accuracy, and reducing reliance on high-risk diagnostic procedures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses challenges in cardiac rehabilitation, specifically data limitations like scarcity, unsuitable records, and missing values in medical datasets, aiming to ease analysis and improve clinical solutions.

Method: A Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) is used to synthesize realistic clinical records mimicking real-world data to enhance dataset diversity and size.

Result: The CVAE-generated data is coherent and realistic, improving accuracy in cardiac risk classification and outperforming existing synthetic data generation methods.

Conclusion: This approach helps overcome limitations in medical datasets, boosts model performance for risk prediction, and minimizes risky diagnostic procedures, making it a valuable tool for cardiac rehabilitation and clinical analysis.

Abstract: Cardiac rehabilitation constitutes a structured clinical process involving multiple interdependent phases, individualized medical decisions, and the coordinated participation of diverse healthcare professionals. This sequential and adaptive nature enables the program to be modeled as a business process, thereby facilitating its analysis. Nevertheless, studies in this context face significant limitations inherent to real-world medical databases: data are often scarce due to both economic costs and the time required for collection; many existing records are not suitable for specific analytical purposes; and, finally, there is a high prevalence of missing values, as not all patients undergo the same diagnostic tests. To address these limitations, this work proposes an architecture based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for the synthesis of realistic clinical records that are coherent with real-world observations. The primary objective is to increase the size and diversity of the available datasets in order to enhance the performance of cardiac risk prediction models and to reduce the need for potentially hazardous diagnostic procedures, such as exercise stress testing. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture is capable of generating coherent and realistic synthetic data, whose use improves the accuracy of the various classifiers employed for cardiac risk detection, outperforming state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for synthetic data generation.

### [154] [Does the Data Processing Inequality Reflect Practice? On the Utility of Low-Level Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21315)
*Roy Turgeman,Tom Tirer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether low-level processing before classification can improve accuracy, contrary to the data processing inequality principle. It provides theoretical and empirical evidence supporting pre-classification processing benefits, including denoising and encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to challenge and understand exceptions to the data processing inequality, exploring why and under what conditions low-level preprocessing tasks can improve classification performance, despite technological advancements in deep neural networks.

Method: The authors conduct a theoretical analysis of binary classification using a near-optimal Bayes classifier and prove cases where pre-classification processing improves accuracy. They also perform empirical studies to validate these trends on benchmark datasets.

Result: The study discovers that pre-classification processing can enhance classification accuracy for finite training samples. Empirical validation demonstrates results consistent with theoretical predictions, showing improved performance from preprocessing methods under specific conditions like noise and class balance.

Conclusion: Low-level processing tasks, such as denoising or encoding, can be beneficial before classification, even with modern deep classifiers, depending on factors like training size and noise. The paper supports this through theoretical proofs and empirical evidence.

Abstract: The data processing inequality is an information-theoretic principle stating that the information content of a signal cannot be increased by processing the observations. In particular, it suggests that there is no benefit in enhancing the signal or encoding it before addressing a classification problem. This assertion can be proven to be true for the case of the optimal Bayes classifier. However, in practice, it is common to perform "low-level" tasks before "high-level" downstream tasks despite the overwhelming capabilities of modern deep neural networks. In this paper, we aim to understand when and why low-level processing can be beneficial for classification. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of a binary classification setup, where we consider a classifier that is tightly connected to the optimal Bayes classifier and converges to it as the number of training samples increases. We prove that for any finite number of training samples, there exists a pre-classification processing that improves the classification accuracy. We also explore the effect of class separation, training set size, and class balance on the relative gain from this procedure. We support our theory with an empirical investigation of the theoretical setup. Finally, we conduct an empirical study where we investigate the effect of denoising and encoding on the performance of practical deep classifiers on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we vary the size and class distribution of the training set, and the noise level, and demonstrate trends that are consistent with our theoretical results.

### [155] [Disentangling Fact from Sentiment: A Dynamic Conflict-Consensus Framework for Multimodal Fake News Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20670)
*Weilin Zhou,Zonghao Ying,Junjie Mu,Shengwei Tian,Quanchen Zou,Deyue Zhang,Dongdong Yang,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Conflict-Consensus Framework (DCCF), a novel paradigm for multimodal fake news detection that identifies and amplifies cross-modal contradictions instead of suppressing them, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal fake news detection methods focus on consistency-based fusion, which reduces cross-modal discrepancies. However, this causes over-smoothing and loses critical evidence of fabrication. The study is motivated to overcome this limitation by amplifying these discrepancies.

Method: The proposed DCCF consists of three phases: 1) decoupling inputs into Fact and Sentiment spaces to distinguish objective mismatches from emotional dissonance; 2) applying physics-inspired feature dynamics to extract informative conflicts; and 3) using a conflict-consensus mechanism to contextualize these discrepancies for accurate judgment.

Result: The DCCF outperforms state-of-the-art methods with an average accuracy improvement of 3.52% across three real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The study concludes that amplifying cross-modal contradictions rather than suppressing them is key to improving multimodal fake news detection, and DCCF effectively addresses this need.

Abstract: Prevalent multimodal fake news detection relies on consistency-based fusion, yet this paradigm fundamentally misinterprets critical cross-modal discrepancies as noise, leading to over-smoothing, which dilutes critical evidence of fabrication. Mainstream consistency-based fusion inherently minimizes feature discrepancies to align modalities, yet this approach fundamentally fails because it inadvertently smoothes out the subtle cross-modal contradictions that serve as the primary evidence of fabrication. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Conflict-Consensus Framework (DCCF), an inconsistency-seeking paradigm designed to amplify rather than suppress contradictions. First, DCCF decouples inputs into independent Fact and Sentiment spaces to distinguish objective mismatches from emotional dissonance. Second, we employ physics-inspired feature dynamics to iteratively polarize these representations, actively extracting maximally informative conflicts. Finally, a conflict-consensus mechanism standardizes these local discrepancies against the global context for robust deliberative judgment.Extensive experiments conducted on three real world datasets demonstrate that DCCF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 3.52\%.

### [156] [Measuring all the noises of LLM Evals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21326)
*Sida Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes noise in evaluations of LLMs, proposing methods to measure and mitigate prediction and data noise, enabling more accurate comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To effectively apply statistical methods to LLM evaluations, it’s necessary to address unique noise traits that affect accurate assessment.

Method: The paper introduces the 'all-pairs paired' method, which uses paired analysis across all LLM pairs, measuring noise components through millions of question-level predictions.

Result: They identify distinct predictable noise levels in evaluations, with prediction noise generally exceeding data noise, and demonstrate that averaging predictions enhances results.

Conclusion: The findings help practitioners improve statistical power, assess significance, and conduct controlled experiments to detect smaller effects more reliably.

Abstract: Separating signal from noise is central to experimental science. Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers on a given question, data noise from sampling questions, and their combined total noise following the law of total variance. To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings. These measurements revealed clear patterns. First, each eval exhibits a characteristic and highly predictable total noise level across all model pairs. Second, paired prediction noise typically exceeds paired data noise, which means reducing prediction noise by averaging can significantly increase statistical power. These findings enable practitioners to assess significance without custom testing and to detect much smaller effects in controlled experiments.

*Yuanhao Xi,Xiaohuan Bing,Ramin Yahyapour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyDRA is a fine-tuning framework for mobile Vision Language Models (VLMs) that improves performance with hierarchical and dynamic rank scheduling, without increasing trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational challenges and inefficiencies of training mobile-oriented Vision Language Models (VLMs) using standard LoRA, which has limited capacity to handle both text and image modalities.

Method: HyDRA employs hierarchical optimization by assigning different ranks to layers, as well as fine-grained rank adjustments within layers. It also uses dynamic optimization via a lightweight performance model to determine and adjust ranks automatically during fine-tuning.

Result: HyDRA achieves a 4.7% improvement over baseline models on benchmarks and sometimes surpasses full-parameter fine-tuning, all without increasing the number of trainable parameters.

Conclusion: HyDRA demonstrates that parameter-efficient fine-tuning with adaptive rank optimization yields superior performance for mobile-oriented VLMs, making it a viable solution for resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have undergone significant advancements, particularly with the emergence of mobile-oriented VLMs, which offer a wide range of application scenarios. However, the substantial computational requirements for training these models present a significant obstacle to their practical application. To address this issue, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been proposed. Nevertheless, the standard LoRA with a fixed rank lacks sufficient capability for training mobile VLMs that process both text and image modalities. In this work, we introduce HyDRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework designed to implement hierarchical and dynamic rank scheduling for mobile VLMs. This framework incorporates two essential optimization strategies: (1) hierarchical optimization, which involves a coarse-grained approach that assigns different ranks to various layers, as well as a fine-grained method that adjusts ranks within individual layers, and (2) dynamic adjustment, which employs an end-to-end automatic optimization using a lightweight performance model to determine and adjust ranks during the fine-tuning process. Comprehensive experiments conducted on popular benchmarks demonstrate that HyDRA consistently outperforms the baseline, achieving a 4.7\% improvement across various model sizes without increasing the number of trainable parameters. In some tasks, it even surpasses full-parameter fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates VLM-based reward models under a unified setup, revealing that a simple triplet loss surpasses more complex methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of meaningful comparison in VLM-based reward models due to differing frameworks, data, and conditions.

Method: The authors compare reward models using a unified backbone, finetuning data, and evaluation environments, focusing on objectives.

Result: Under identical conditions, a straightforward triplet loss surpasses recent state-of-the-art VLM-based reward modeling techniques.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that recent performance gains in VLM-based reward models are largely driven by differences in data and architecture, not objectives.

Abstract: Learning generalizable reward functions is a core challenge in embodied intelligence. Recent work leverages contrastive vision language models (VLMs) to obtain dense, domain-agnostic rewards without human supervision. These methods adapt VLMs into reward models through increasingly complex learning objectives, yet meaningful comparison remains difficult due to differences in training data, architectures, and evaluation settings. In this work, we isolate the impact of the learning objective by evaluating recent VLM-based reward models under a unified framework with identical backbones, finetuning data, and evaluation environments. Using Meta-World tasks, we assess modeling accuracy by measuring consistency with ground truth reward and correlation with expert progress. Remarkably, we show that a simple triplet loss outperforms state-of-the-art methods, suggesting that much of the improvements in recent approaches could be attributed to differences in data and architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the stability, robustness, and training performance of multimodal autoencoders, which are essential for handling complex multimodal data.

Method: Theoretical derivation of Lipschitz constants for fusion methods in multimodal autoencoders, followed by introducing a regularized attention-based fusion method and conducting empirical validation experiments.

Result: The proposed fusion method aligns with theoretical predictions and outperforms existing strategies in consistency, convergence speed, and accuracy.

Conclusion: The work establishes a theoretical foundation for multimodal autoencoder fusion while introducing a novel method to enhance their performance and stability during training.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of multimodal autoencoders has gained significant attention due to their potential to handle multimodal complex data types and improve model performance. Understanding the stability and robustness of these models is crucial for optimizing their training, architecture, and real-world applicability. This paper presents an analysis of Lipschitz properties in multimodal autoencoders, combining both theoretical insights and empirical validation to enhance the training stability of these models. We begin by deriving the theoretical Lipschitz constants for aggregation methods within the multimodal autoencoder framework. We then introduce a regularized attention-based fusion method, developed based on our theoretical analysis, which demonstrates improved stability and performance during training. Through a series of experiments, we empirically validate our theoretical findings by estimating the Lipschitz constants across multiple trials and fusion strategies. Our results demonstrate that our proposed fusion function not only aligns with theoretical predictions but also outperforms existing strategies in terms of consistency, convergence speed, and accuracy. This work provides a solid theoretical foundation for understanding fusion in multimodal autoencoders and contributes a solution for enhancing their performance.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for assessing the robustness of neural networks with early exits, optimizing their verification process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the safety and efficiency of AI systems by addressing the verification challenges posed by early exit architectures.

Method: Introduced a robustness property for early exit architectures and developed a baseline algorithm with early stopping and heuristic optimizations for verification using off-the-shelf solvers.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated effectiveness through experiments on benchmarks, achieving inference acceleration and enhanced verifiability compared to standard networks.

Conclusion: Early exit neural networks offer a combined advantage of faster inference and easier verifiability, aiding in balancing accuracy and efficiency for practical deployment.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and efficiency of AI systems is a central goal of modern research. Formal verification provides guarantees of neural network robustness, while early exits improve inference efficiency by enabling intermediate predictions. Yet verifying networks with early exits introduces new challenges due to their conditional execution paths. In this work, we define a robustness property tailored to early exit architectures and show how off-the-shelf solvers can be used to assess it. We present a baseline algorithm, enhanced with an early stopping strategy and heuristic optimizations that maintain soundness and completeness. Experiments on multiple benchmarks validate our framework's effectiveness and demonstrate the performance gains of the improved algorithm. Alongside the natural inference acceleration provided by early exits, we show that they also enhance verifiability, enabling more queries to be solved in less time compared to standard networks. Together with a robustness analysis, we show how these metrics can help users navigate the inherent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

*Brian Lu,Hongyu Zhao,Shuo Sun,Hao Peng,Rui Ding,Hongyuan Mei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies the effectiveness of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) versus supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in generalizing complex reasoning tasks in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the poorly understood conditions under which RLVR produces robust generalization in reasoning tasks, leveraging probabilistic inference on causal graphical models.

Method: Fine-tuning Qwen-2.5-Instruct models (3B-32B scale) by implementing RLVR and SFT approaches, analyzing generalization across axes like probabilistic query level and structural complexity.

Result: RLVR outperformed SFT in generalization, especially for complex queries, when the model initially had strong reasoning competence. It enhances the accuracy and reduces errors in probability calculations.

Conclusion: While RLVR effectively improves causal reasoning subskills, its advantages depend on the model’s initial reasoning competence, highlighting RLVR’s selective efficacy based on training conditions.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, the conditions under which RLVR yields robust generalization remain poorly understood. This paper provides an empirical study of RLVR generalization in the setting of probabilistic inference over causal graphical models. This setting offers two natural axes along which to examine generalization: (i) the level of the probabilistic query -- associational, interventional, or counterfactual -- and (ii) the structural complexity of the query, measured by the size of its relevant subgraph. We construct datasets of causal graphs and queries spanning these difficulty axes and fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models using RLVR or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We vary both the model scale (3B-32B) and the query level included in training. We find that RLVR yields stronger within-level and across-level generalization than SFT, but only for specific combinations of model size and training query level. Further analysis shows that RLVR's effectiveness depends on the model's initial reasoning competence. With sufficient initial competence, RLVR improves an LLM's marginalization strategy and reduces errors in intermediate probability calculations, producing substantial accuracy gains, particularly on more complex queries. These findings show that RLVR can improve specific causal reasoning subskills, with its benefits emerging only when the model has sufficient initial competence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses the risks of information leakage during evaluation of Time Series Foundation Models and introduces TS-Arena, a platform emphasizing a strict temporal split for authentic performance assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) often suffers from issues like information leakage and illegitimate transfer of global patterns, necessitating reliable benchmarking methods.

Method: The authors developed TS-Arena, a platform enforcing strict global temporal splits and pre-registration on live data streams, ensuring evaluation aligns with a genuinely unknown future.

Result: TS-Arena prevents historical contamination and reliably assesses model generalization under realistic constraints, initially demonstrated in the energy sector.

Conclusion: TS-Arena ensures operational integrity for forecasts, offering a sustainable approach to benchmarking TSFMs with an authentic evaluation of their temporal generalization.

Abstract: While Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) offer transformative capabilities for forecasting, they simultaneously risk triggering a fundamental evaluation crisis. This crisis is driven by information leakage due to overlapping training and test sets across different models, as well as the illegitimate transfer of global patterns to test data. While the ability to learn shared temporal dynamics represents a primary strength of these models, their evaluation on historical archives often permits the exploitation of observed global shocks, which violates the independence required for valid benchmarking. We introduce TS-Arena, a platform that restores the operational integrity of forecasting by treating the genuinely unknown future as the definitive test environment. By implementing a pre-registration mechanism on live data streams, the platform ensures that evaluation targets remain physically non-existent during inference, thereby enforcing a strict global temporal split. This methodology establishes a moving temporal frontier that prevents historical contamination and provides an authentic assessment of model generalization. Initially applied within the energy sector, TS-Arena provides a sustainable infrastructure for comparing foundation models under real-world constraints. A prototype of the platform is available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/DAG-UPB/TS-Arena.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Matrix exponential has diverse applications in fields like control theory, quantum mechanics, and generative AI. A need exists for more accurate and computationally efficient methods, especially for modern generative models.

Method: The authors propose a Taylor-based algorithm optimized through rigorous error analysis and dynamic adjustments of Taylor order and scaling factor to meet error tolerances, improving efficiency.

Result: Numerical experiments reveal that the algorithm achieves significant speed improvements and high numerical stability compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: This Taylor-based algorithm is validated as an efficient and stable tool for large-scale matrix exponential computations, particularly aiding high-throughput generative AI workflows.

Abstract: The matrix exponential is a fundamental operator in scientific computing and system simulation, with applications ranging from control theory and quantum mechanics to modern generative machine learning. While Padé approximants combined with scaling and squaring have long served as the standard, recent Taylor-based methods, which utilize polynomial evaluation schemes that surpass the classical Paterson--Stockmeyer technique, offer superior accuracy and reduced computational complexity. This paper presents an optimized Taylor-based algorithm for the matrix exponential, specifically designed for the high-throughput requirements of generative AI flows. We provide a rigorous error analysis and develop a dynamic selection strategy for the Taylor order and scaling factor to minimize computational effort under a prescribed error tolerance. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach provides significant acceleration and maintains high numerical stability compared to existing state-of-the-art implementations. These results establish the proposed method as a highly efficient tool for large-scale generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the interpretability and generalizability of models for predicting properties of complex materials, moving beyond traditional neural networks.

Method: Deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE was applied to analyze data and determine properties of 2D materials with defects. Comparisons were made with graph neural networks.

Result: SEGVAE demonstrated comparable or identical outcomes to graph neural network-based methods in predicting material properties.

Conclusion: Symbolic regression, specifically SEGVAE, offers interpretable, generalizable models that rival the predictive accuracy of graph neural networks in material science applications.

Abstract: Machine learning models have become firmly established across all scientific fields. Extracting features from data and making inferences based on them with neural network models often yields high accuracy; however, this approach has several drawbacks. Symbolic regression is a powerful technique for discovering analytical equations that describe data, providing interpretable and generalizable models capable of predicting unseen data. Symbolic regression methods have gained new momentum with the advancement of neural network technologies and offer several advantages, the main one being the interpretability of results. In this work, we examined the application of the deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE to determine the properties of two-dimensional materials with defects. Comparing the results with state-of-the-art graph neural network-based methods shows comparable or, in some cases, even identical outcomes. We also discuss the applicability of this class of methods in natural sciences.

TL;DR: The paper presents GLiBRL, a novel deep BRL method improving efficiency and accuracy in learning models, and achieving superior results on MetaWorld benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of classical BRL methods that rely on known transition and reward models, making them less applicable in real-world settings.

Method: Proposes GLiBRL, using generalised linear models with learnable basis functions to perform efficient and accurate Bayesian inference for task parameters, avoiding challenges associated with ELBO optimisation.

Result: On MetaWorld ML10/45 benchmarks, GLiBRL significantly outperforms VariBAD, showing up to 2.7x improvement, and achieves competitive performance compared to other leading methods.

Conclusion: GLiBRL demonstrates improved success rates, reduced variance, and consistent performance, addressing inefficiencies in previous deep BRL approaches.

Abstract: Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (BRL) provides a framework for generalisation of Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems from its use of Bayesian task parameters in the transition and reward models. However, classical BRL methods assume known forms of transition and reward models, reducing their applicability in real-world problems. As a result, recent deep BRL methods have started to incorporate model learning, though the use of neural networks directly on the joint data and task parameters requires optimising the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). ELBOs are difficult to optimise and may result in indistinctive task parameters, hence compromised BRL policies. To this end, we introduce a novel deep BRL method, Generalised Linear Models in Deep Bayesian RL with Learnable Basis Functions (GLiBRL), that enables efficient and accurate learning of transition and reward models, with fully tractable marginal likelihood and Bayesian inference on task parameters and model noises. On challenging MetaWorld ML10/45 benchmarks, GLiBRL improves the success rate of one of the state-of-the-art deep BRL methods, VariBAD, by up to 2.7x. Comparing against representative or recent deep BRL / Meta-RL methods, such as MAML, RL2, SDVT, TrMRL and ECET, GLiBRL also demonstrates its low-variance and decent performance consistently.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dual specialist ensemble model to better predict and manage wildfire risks in urban areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wildfire risk models fail to effectively capture the complex dynamics of fire spread in urbanized wildland interfaces.

Method: The research uses a dual specialist framework: a graph neural network (GNN) for environmental contagion and an XGBoost model for structural fragility, combined using logistic stacking.

Result: Applied to the 2025 Eaton Fire, the model showed that environmental factors overwhelmingly influence fire spread, while structural aspects like eaves are key weak points.

Conclusion: This framework enables targeted wildfire mitigation strategies by integrating environmental and structural risk insights, improving urban resilience to wildfires.

Abstract: As wildfires increasingly evolve into urban conflagrations, traditional risk models that treat structures as isolated assets fail to capture the non-linear contagion dynamics characteristic of the wildland urban interface (WUI). This research bridges the gap between mechanistic physics and data driven learning by establishing a novel dual specialist ensemble framework that disentangles vulnerability into two distinct vectors, environmental contagion and structural fragility. The architecture integrates two specialized predictive streams, an environmental specialist, implemented as a graph neural network (GNN) that operationalizes the community as a directed contagion graph weighted by physics informed convection, radiation, and ember probabilities, and enriched with high dimensional Google AlphaEarth Foundation embeddings, and a Structural Specialist, implemented via XGBoost to isolate granular asset level resilience. Applied to the 2025 Eaton Fire, the framework reveals a critical dichotomy in risk drivers. The GNN demonstrates that neighborhood scale environmental pressure overwhelmingly dominates intrinsic structural features in defining propagation pathways, while the XGBoost model identifies eaves as the primary micro scale ingress vector. By synthesizing these divergent signals through logistic stacking, the ensemble achieves robust classification and generates a diagnostic risk topology. This capability empowers decision makers to move beyond binary loss prediction and precisely target mitigation prioritizing vegetation management for high connectivity clusters and structural hardening for architecturally vulnerable nodes thereby operationalizing a proactive, data driven approach to community resilience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high bandwidth usage and privacy concerns in federated learning by improving gradient transmission efficiency and privacy protection.

Method: FedMPDD encodes client gradients via directional derivatives along random vectors, significantly compressing messages to reduce communication overhead while enhancing privacy through geometric properties of projections.

Result: FedMPDD achieves $O(1/\sqrt{K})$ convergence rate, matches FedSGD performance, reduces uplink communication bandwidth, and provides inherent privacy benefits against gradient inversion attacks.

Conclusion: FedMPDD effectively balances utility and privacy in federated learning, offering tunable trade-offs and demonstrating strong experimental validation.

Abstract: This paper introduces \texttt{FedMPDD} (\textbf{Fed}erated Learning via \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{P}rojected \textbf{D}irectional \textbf{D}erivatives), a novel algorithm that simultaneously optimizes bandwidth utilization and enhances privacy in Federated Learning. The core idea of \texttt{FedMPDD} is to encode each client's high-dimensional gradient by computing its directional derivatives along multiple random vectors. This compresses the gradient into a much smaller message, significantly reducing uplink communication costs from $\mathcal{O}(d)$ to $\mathcal{O}(m)$, where $m \ll d$. The server then decodes the aggregated information by projecting it back onto the same random vectors. Our key insight is that averaging multiple projections overcomes the dimension-dependent convergence limitations of a single projection. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing that \texttt{FedMPDD} converges at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$, matching the performance of FedSGD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method provides some inherent privacy against gradient inversion attacks due to the geometric properties of low-rank projections, offering a tunable privacy-utility trade-off controlled by the number of projections. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate our theory and demonstrates our results.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models, despite their advancements, are vulnerable to adversarial threats that can affect performance through imperceptible perturbations, poisoned data, or privacy breaches.

Method: The defense system integrates adversarial training within a mixture-of-experts framework. It utilizes nine pre-trained ResNet-18 models and optimizes these expert models and gating mechanisms in an end-to-end fashion.

Result: The proposed defense system outperforms state-of-the-art defense mechanisms and more complex architectures, showcasing improved robustness.

Conclusion: Integrating adversarial training in a mixture-of-experts framework with simpler backbones like ResNet-18 can enhance machine learning models' robustness against adversarial threats.

Abstract: Machine learning is a powerful tool enabling full automation of a huge number of tasks without explicit programming. Despite recent progress of machine learning in different domains, these models have shown vulnerabilities when they are exposed to adversarial threats. Adversarial threats aim to hinder the machine learning models from satisfying their objectives. They can create adversarial perturbations, which are imperceptible to humans' eyes but have the ability to cause misclassification during inference. Moreover, they can poison the training data to harm the model's performance or they can query the model to steal its sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a defense system, which devises an adversarial training module within mixture-of-experts architecture to enhance its robustness against adversarial threats. In our proposed defense system, we use nine pre-trained experts with ResNet-18 as their backbone. During end-to-end training, the parameters of expert models and gating mechanism are jointly updated allowing further optimization of the experts. Our proposed defense system outperforms state-of-the-art defense systems and plain classifiers, which use a more complex architecture than our model's backbone.

*Pierre Abillama,Changwoo Lee,Juechu Dong,David Blaauw,Dennis Sylvester,Hun-Seok Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of fitting large transformer-based models on single GPUs and mitigating computational costs through Block Low-Rank (BLR) compression techniques, while introducing custom Triton kernels for enhanced performance on memory-constrained devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models are becoming increasingly large, leading to difficulties in fitting and executing them efficiently on single GPUs due to high computational and memory demands.

Method: The authors utilize roofline analysis to identify memory-bound performance issues in multi-token inference with BLR methods. They design custom Triton kernels incorporating partial fusion and memory layout optimizations to enhance efficiency for BLR-based approaches.

Result: The proposed kernels achieve up to 3.76× speedups and 3× model size compression over PyTorch dense baselines, targeting memory-constrained GPUs and demonstrating compatibility with various models such as Llama, GPT-2, DiT, and ViT.

Conclusion: Custom Triton kernels improve inference speed and memory efficiency for BLR methods, enabling deployment of large foundation models on memory-constrained GPUs without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based foundation models have made them the default choice for many tasks, but their rapidly growing size makes fitting a full model on a single GPU increasingly difficult and their computational cost prohibitive. Block low-rank (BLR) compression techniques address this challenge by learning compact representations of weight matrices. While traditional low-rank (LR) methods often incur sharp accuracy drops, BLR approaches such as Monarch and BLAST can better capture the underlying structure, thus preserving accuracy while reducing computations and memory footprints. In this work, we use roofline analysis to show that, although BLR methods achieve theoretical savings and practical speedups for single-token inference, multi-token inference often becomes memory-bound in practice, increasing latency despite compiler-level optimizations in PyTorch. To address this, we introduce custom Triton kernels with partial fusion and memory layout optimizations for both Monarch and BLAST. On memory-constrained NVIDIA GPUs such as Jetson Orin Nano and A40, our kernels deliver up to $3.76\times$ speedups and $3\times$ model size compression over PyTorch dense baselines using CUDA backend and compiler-level optimizations, while supporting various models including Llama-7/1B, GPT2-S, DiT-XL/2, and ViT-B.

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework to certify the robustness of models against both data poisoning and test-time adversarial attacks, using a formal safety verification approach inspired by control theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of formal guarantees and restrictive assumptions in current defenses against data poisoning attacks in machine learning.

Method: Develop a framework using gradient-based training, discrete-time dynamical system modeling, and barrier certificates (BCs) parameterized as neural networks to certify robustness under worst-case poisoning. Formulate PAC bounds using scenario convex programs to generalize certification beyond the training data.

Result: The framework effectively certifies non-trivial perturbation budgets under poisoning attacks for datasets like MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 in a model-agnostic manner without prior attack knowledge.

Conclusion: This work provides a unified model-agnostic robustness certification framework for both training and test-time adversarial attacks, enhancing the reliability of machine learning in safety-critical contexts.

Abstract: The increasing use of machine learning in safety-critical domains amplifies the risk of adversarial threats, especially data poisoning attacks that corrupt training data to degrade performance or induce unsafe behavior. Most existing defenses lack formal guarantees or rely on restrictive assumptions about the model class, attack type, extent of poisoning, or point-wise certification, limiting their practical reliability. This paper introduces a principled formal robustness certification framework that models gradient-based training as a discrete-time dynamical system (dt-DS) and formulates poisoning robustness as a formal safety verification problem. By adapting the concept of barrier certificates (BCs) from control theory, we introduce sufficient conditions to certify a robust radius ensuring that the terminal model remains safe under worst-case ${\ell}_p$-norm based poisoning. To make this practical, we parameterize BCs as neural networks trained on finite sets of poisoned trajectories. We further derive probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds by solving a scenario convex program (SCP), which yields a confidence lower bound on the certified robustness radius generalizing beyond the training set. Importantly, our framework also extends to certification against test-time attacks, making it the first unified framework to provide formal guarantees in both training and test-time attack settings. Experiments on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 show that our approach certifies non-trivial perturbation budgets while being model-agnostic and requiring no prior knowledge of the attack or contamination level.

*Sami Marouani,Kamal Singh,Baptiste Jeudy,Amaury Habrard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores three predictive modeling levels for flow delay, including a neural baseline, a novel neural network (FlowKANet), and symbolic surrogate models for increased efficiency and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern communication networks require precise flow delay predictions to enhance optimization and management. This paper aims to investigate more efficient and transparent modeling techniques.

Method: Three modeling approaches are presented: 1) a heterogeneous GNN baseline with attention-based message passing, 2) FlowKANet, which uses Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and attention, and 3) symbolic surrogate models via block-wise regression.

Result: FlowKANet achieves a balance of efficiency and accuracy while symbolic surrogate models provide closed-form equations that reduce complexity and maintain graph-structured dependencies.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of KAN layers for their efficiency and accuracy, and symbolic models for lightweight deployment and transparency in flow delay prediction systems.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of flow delay is essential for optimizing and managing modern communication networks. We investigate three levels of modeling for this task. First, we implement a heterogeneous GNN with attention-based message passing, establishing a strong neural baseline. Second, we propose FlowKANet in which Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks replace standard MLP layers, reducing trainable parameters while maintaining competitive predictive performance. FlowKANet integrates KAMP-Attn (Kolmogorov-Arnold Message Passing with Attention), embedding KAN operators directly into message-passing and attention computation. Finally, we distill the model into symbolic surrogate models using block-wise regression, producing closed-form equations that eliminate trainable weights while preserving graph-structured dependencies. The results show that KAN layers provide a favorable trade-off between efficiency and accuracy and that symbolic surrogates emphasize the potential for lightweight deployment and enhanced transparency.

### [173] [DiEC: Diffusion Embedded Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20905)
*Haidong Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiEC, a clustering method leveraging pretrained diffusion U-Nets, achieving competitive performance by optimizing layering and timesteps for representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance clustering performance by utilizing the rich representation trajectory of pretrained diffusion U-Nets effectively.

Method: The approach involves a two-stage method: first selecting a clustering-friendly middle layer (CML) and then performing optimal timestep search (OTS). Lightweight mapping and advanced objective regularizations further refine clustering quality.

Result: The proposed DiEC method demonstrated competitive performance in clustering tasks across multiple standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: DiEC capitalizes on the internal activations of diffusion U-Nets for clustering, advancing unsupervised learning by focusing on layer and timestep selection and incorporating innovative optimizations.

Abstract: Deep clustering hinges on learning representations that are inherently clusterable. However, using a single encoder to produce a fixed embedding ignores the representation trajectory formed by a pretrained diffusion model across network hierarchies and noise timesteps, where clusterability varies substantially. We propose DiEC (Diffusion Embedded Clustering), which performs unsupervised clustering by directly reading internal activations from a pretrained diffusion U-Net.
  DiEC formulates representation selection as a two-dimensional search over layer x timestep, and exploits a weak-coupling property to decompose it into two stages. Specifically, we first fix the U-Net bottleneck layer as the Clustering-friendly Middle Layer (CML), and then use Optimal Timestep Search (OTS) to identify the clustering-optimal timestep (t*). During training, we extract bottleneck features at the fixed t* and obtain clustering representations via a lightweight residual mapping. We optimize a DEC-style KL self-training objective, augmented with adaptive graph regularization and entropy regularization to strengthen cluster structures. In parallel, we introduce a denoising-consistency branch at random timesteps to stabilize the representations and preserve generative consistency. Experiments show that DiEC achieves competitive clustering performance on multiple standard benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GCO-HPIF, a machine-learning framework for predicting and explaining the hardness of graph-based combinatorial optimization problems, achieving high predictive and explanatory performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the difficulty of understanding and predicting the computational hardness of graph-based combinatorial optimization problems, which is crucial for algorithm selection and optimization.

Method: The GCO-HPIF framework involves two stages: machine-learning models to classify hardness based on graph features and using association rule mining for explanation. It is applied to solve the maximum clique problem using datasets and diverse algorithms.

Result: The framework achieved exceptional predictive accuracy (weighted F1 score: 0.9921, ROC-AUC: 0.9083) using only three graph features. It also provided clear explanations for predictions and accurately predicted computation times (RMSE: 5.12%, R2: 0.991).

Conclusion: The GCO-HPIF framework effectively predicts and explains computational hardness, providing both accurate predictions and interpretable insights, making it valuable for graph-based combinatorial optimization problems.

Abstract: This study introduces GCO-HPIF, a general machine-learning-based framework to predict and explain the computational hardness of combinatorial optimization problems that can be represented on graphs. The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, a dataset is created comprising problem-agnostic graph features and hardness classifications of problem instances. Machine-learning-based classification algorithms are trained to map graph features to hardness categories. In the second stage, the framework explains the predictions using an association rule mining algorithm. Additionally, machine-learning-based regression models are trained to predict algorithmic computation times. The GCO-HPIF framework was applied to a dataset of 3287 maximum clique problem instances compiled from the COLLAB, IMDB, and TWITTER graph datasets using five state-of-the-art algorithms, namely three exact branch-and-bound-based algorithms (Gurobi, CliSAT, and MOMC) and two graph-neural-network-based algorithms (EGN and HGS). The framework demonstrated excellent performance in predicting instance hardness, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.9921, a minority-class F1 score of 0.878, and an ROC-AUC score of 0.9083 using only three graph features. The best association rule found by the FP-Growth algorithm for explaining the hardness predictions had a support of 0.8829 for hard instances and an overall accuracy of 87.64 percent, underscoring the framework's usefulness for both prediction and explanation. Furthermore, the best-performing regression model for predicting computation times achieved a percentage RMSE of 5.12 and an R2 value of 0.991.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RevFFN is a new memory-efficient fine-tuning technique for mixture-of-experts large language models, reducing memory consumption by reconstructing layer inputs during backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning methods for large language models incur significant memory overhead, especially for full parameter fine-tuning, which limits their usability on low-resource setups.

Method: RevFFN uses reversible Transformer blocks to reconstruct input activations during backpropagation, eliminating the need to store most intermediate activations in memory.

Result: RevFFN significantly lowers the peak memory usage, enabling full parameter fine-tuning on single consumer or server-grade GPUs without relying on additional hardware.

Conclusion: This approach preserves the model's capacity while reducing memory demands, making fine-tuning more accessible and efficient.

Abstract: Full parameter fine tuning is a key technique for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, but it incurs substantial memory overhead due to the need to cache extensive intermediate activations for backpropagation. This bottleneck makes full fine tuning of contemporary large scale LLMs challenging in practice. Existing distributed training frameworks such as DeepSpeed alleviate this issue using techniques like ZeRO and FSDP, which rely on multi GPU memory or CPU offloading, but often require additional hardware resources and reduce training speed. We introduce RevFFN, a memory efficient fine tuning paradigm for mixture of experts (MoE) LLMs. RevFFN employs carefully designed reversible Transformer blocks that allow reconstruction of layer input activations from outputs during backpropagation, eliminating the need to store most intermediate activations in memory. While preserving the expressive capacity of MoE architectures, this approach significantly reduces peak memory consumption for full parameter fine tuning. As a result, RevFFN enables efficient full fine tuning on a single consumer grade or server grade GPU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges in subscription pricing optimization by balancing revenue, retention, and customer trust through a dynamic, data-driven framework.

Method: The authors integrate seasonal time-series models with tree-based learners, conduct Monte Carlo simulations, enforce guardrails for business constraints and implement real-time modular APIs for recalibration.

Result: The framework improved performance in SaaS portfolios by reallocating price adjustments based on willingness-to-pay while minimizing churn and maintaining fairness across segments.

Abstract: This paper presents a marketing analytics framework that operationalizes subscription pricing as a dynamic, guardrailed decision system, uniting multivariate demand forecasting, segment-level price elasticity, and churn propensity to optimize revenue, margin, and retention. The approach blends seasonal time-series models with tree-based learners, runs Monte Carlo scenario tests to map risk envelopes, and solves a constrained optimization that enforces business guardrails on customer experience, margin floors, and allowable churn. Validated across heterogeneous SaaS portfolios, the method consistently outperforms static tiers and uniform uplifts by reallocating price moves toward segments with higher willingness-to-pay while protecting price-sensitive cohorts. The system is designed for real-time recalibration via modular APIs and includes model explainability for governance and compliance. Managerially, the framework functions as a strategy playbook that clarifies when to shift from flat to dynamic pricing, how to align pricing with CLV and MRR targets, and how to embed ethical guardrails, enabling durable growth without eroding customer trust.

*Yiren Shen,Juan J. Alonso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines how the size of training data impacts the accuracy of a graph neural network (GNN) surrogate model for aerodynamic predictions, using a new open-source multi-fidelity dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in empirical guidelines and datasets for data-driven surrogate modeling in vehicle design, focusing on the relationship between dataset size and surrogate model performance.

Method: Released a multi-fidelity dataset of double-delta wing aerodynamics, generated using Saltelli sampling. Conducted scaling studies with varying training dataset sizes and GNN model sizes to analyze test errors and data utilization efficiency.

Result: Test error decreases with a power-law exponent of -0.6122 as data size increases. Larger GNN surrogate models utilize data more efficiently, demonstrating a trade-off between dataset generation cost and training budget.

Conclusion: Efficient utilization of datasets by larger models and identification of optimal sampling density provides guidelines for balancing dataset costs and model performance in vehicle design.

Abstract: Data-driven surrogate models are increasingly adopted to accelerate vehicle design. However, open-source multi-fidelity datasets and empirical guidelines linking dataset size to model performance remain limited. This study investigates the relationship between training data size and prediction accuracy for a graph neural network (GNN) based surrogate model for aerodynamic field prediction. We release an open-source, multi-fidelity aerodynamic dataset for double-delta wings, comprising 2448 flow snapshots across 272 geometries evaluated at angles of attack from 11 (degree) to 19 (degree) at Ma=0.3 using both Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) and Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solvers. The geometries are generated using a nested Saltelli sampling scheme to support future dataset expansion and variance-based sensitivity analysis. Using this dataset, we conduct a preliminary empirical scaling study of the MF-VortexNet surrogate by constructing six training datasets with sizes ranging from 40 to 1280 snapshots and training models with 0.1 to 2.4 million parameters under a fixed training budget. We find that the test error decreases with data size with a power-law exponent of -0.6122, indicating efficient data utilization. Based on this scaling law, we estimate that the optimal sampling density is approximately eight samples per dimension in a d-dimensional design space. The results also suggest improved data utilization efficiency for larger surrogate models, implying a potential trade-off between dataset generation cost and model training budget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more flexible method for solving functional renormalization group equations that can handle complex field configurations and overcome limitations of existing discretization-based methods.

Method: The proposed approach leverages Gaussian process operator learning to construct functional representations directly in function space, allowing incorporation of physical priors and broader applicability.

Result: The method achieves performance equal to or better than existing approximations like the local-potential approximation, while being more adaptable to non-constant fields and complex setups.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates promise for tackling challenging functional differential equations, especially in studying intricate field configurations like instantons.

Abstract: We present an operator learning framework for solving non-perturbative functional renormalization group equations, which are integro-differential equations defined on functionals. Our proposed approach uses Gaussian process operator learning to construct a flexible functional representation formulated directly on function space, making it independent of a particular equation or discretization. Our method is flexible, and can apply to a broad range of functional differential equations while still allowing for the incorporation of physical priors in either the prior mean or the kernel design. We demonstrate the performance of our method on several relevant equations, such as the Wetterich and Wilson--Polchinski equations, showing that it achieves equal or better performance than existing approximations such as the local-potential approximation, while being significantly more flexible. In particular, our method can handle non-constant fields, making it promising for the study of more complex field configurations, such as instantons.

TL;DR: ReACT-Drug is a reinforcement learning-based framework for de novo drug design that optimizes synthetic accessibility and binding affinities, while ensuring chemical validity and novelty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of navigating vast chemical spaces and identifying biologically relevant and synthetically accessible drug candidates, traditional tools lack integration of multi-objective optimization and exploration novel to reinforcement learning.

Method: The ReACT-Drug framework uses Reinforcement Learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), integrating structural biology and chemical synthesis rules. It employs generalist ESM-2 protein embeddings, creates a fragment-based search space inspired by known drugs, and dynamically applies valid chemical transformations.

Result: ReACT-Drug generates novel drug candidates that are chemically valid, synthetically accessible, and achieve competitive binding affinities as validated by MOSES benchmarks.

Conclusion: ReACT-Drug demonstrates the potential of combining reinforcement learning, structural biology, and deep learning for automated and efficient drug design, contributing to innovations in modern drug development.

Abstract: De novo drug design is a crucial component of modern drug development, yet navigating the vast chemical space to find synthetically accessible, high-affinity candidates remains a significant challenge. Reinforcement Learning (RL) enhances this process by enabling multi-objective optimization and exploration of novel chemical space - capabilities that traditional supervised learning methods lack. In this work, we introduce \textbf{ReACT-Drug}, a fully integrated, target-agnostic molecular design framework based on Reinforcement Learning. Unlike models requiring target-specific fine-tuning, ReACT-Drug utilizes a generalist approach by leveraging ESM-2 protein embeddings to identify similar proteins for a given target from a knowledge base such as Protein Data Base (PDB). Thereafter, the known drug ligands corresponding to such proteins are decomposed to initialize a fragment-based search space, biasing the agent towards biologically relevant subspaces. For each such fragment, the pipeline employs a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent guiding a ChemBERTa-encoded molecule through a dynamic action space of chemically valid, reaction-template-based transformations. This results in the generation of \textit{de novo} drug candidates with competitive binding affinities and high synthetic accessibility, while ensuring 100\% chemical validity and novelty as per MOSES benchmarking. This architecture highlights the potential of integrating structural biology, deep representation learning, and chemical synthesis rules to automate and accelerate rational drug design.

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can match human data scientists in incorporating domain-specific knowledge into data science tasks and finds current AI workflows to be limited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to understand the capabilities and limitations of current agentic AI systems in performing data science tasks that require domain-specific knowledge, posing a challenge for the development of AI systems that incorporate such expertise.

Method: The authors designed a prediction task using a synthetic property insurance dataset, where a critical latent variable is embedded in image data rather than in tabular features. This setup tested the ability of agentic AI to process and identify domain-specific variables.

Result: Agentic AI systems relying on generic workflows failed to identify the latent variable and achieve competitive performance, whereas human data scientists using domain knowledge succeeded.

Conclusion: The study concludes that current agentic AI systems are limited in recognizing and utilizing domain-specific insights, emphasizing the necessity for future AI advancements to bridge this gap in data science capabilities.

Abstract: Data science plays a critical role in transforming complex data into actionable insights across numerous domains. Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have significantly automated data science workflows, but a fundamental question persists: Can these agentic AI systems truly match the performance of human data scientists who routinely leverage domain-specific knowledge? We explore this question by designing a prediction task where a crucial latent variable is hidden in relevant image data instead of tabular features. As a result, agentic AI that generates generic codes for modeling tabular data cannot perform well, while human experts could identify the important hidden variable using domain knowledge. We demonstrate this idea with a synthetic dataset for property insurance. Our experiments show that agentic AI that relies on generic analytics workflow falls short of methods that use domain-specific insights. This highlights a key limitation of the current agentic AI for data science and underscores the need for future research to develop agentic AI systems that can better recognize and incorporate domain knowledge.

*Zekai Zhang,Xiao Li,Xiang Li,Lianghe Shi,Meng Wu,Molei Tao,Qing Qu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes memorization versus generalization in diffusion models via representation learning and proposes practical methods for detecting and steering representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the differences between memorization and generalization in diffusion models, particularly their impact on the quality and diversity of generated samples, and to improve their generative capabilities through representation learning.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze representation learning in two-layer ReLU denoising autoencoders, differentiate 'spiky' versus 'balanced' representations to identify memorization and generalization, and verify their findings on real-world diffusion models. They further develop a representation-based memorization detection method and a training-free editing technique.

Result: The study shows that memorization and generalization correlate with spiky and balanced representations, respectively. The methods proposed successfully detect memorization and allow controlled representation steering in diffusion models.

Conclusion: Learning effective representations is key to avoiding memorization, enhancing generalization, and enabling precise control in diffusion models, which can advance their practical and theoretical capabilities.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse samples, yet they risk memorizing training data when overfit to the training objective. We analyze the distinctions between memorization and generalization in diffusion models through the lens of representation learning. By investigating a two-layer ReLU denoising autoencoder (DAE), we prove that (i) memorization corresponds to the model storing raw training samples in the learned weights for encoding and decoding, yielding localized "spiky" representations, whereas (ii) generalization arises when the model captures local data statistics, producing "balanced" representations. Furthermore, we validate these theoretical findings on real-world unconditional and text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the same representation structures emerge in deep generative models with significant practical implications. Building on these insights, we propose a representation-based method for detecting memorization and a training-free editing technique that allows precise control via representation steering. Together, our results highlight that learning good representations is central to novel and meaningful generative modeling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in previous methods for identifying correlated segments in noisy correlation matrices, and develop a robust, generalizable model to enhance efficiency, memory usage, and segmentation precision.

Result: CoSeNet outperforms previous methods in accurately identifying correlated segments in noisy matrices, producing optimized binary noise-free matrices.

Conclusion: CoSeNet enhances identification of correlated segments with improved robustness and generalizability, making it suitable for various applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the optimal identification of correlated segments in noisy correlation matrices. The proposed model is known as CoSeNet (Correlation Seg-mentation Network) and is based on a four-layer algorithmic architecture that includes several processing layers: input, formatting, re-scaling, and segmentation layer. The proposed model can effectively identify correlated segments in such matrices, better than previous approaches for similar problems. Internally, the proposed model utilizes an overlapping technique and uses pre-trained Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, which makes it robust and generalizable. CoSeNet approach also includes a method that optimizes the parameters of the re-scaling layer using a heuristic algorithm and fitness based on a Window Difference-based metric. The output of the model is a binary noise-free matrix representing optimal segmentation as well as its seg-mentation points and can be used in a variety of applications, obtaining compromise solutions between efficiency, memory, and speed of the proposed deployment model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics (CSD) framework for holistic evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods fail to fully capture the dynamic adaptability, competitive fitness, and vulnerability of LLMs in sequential, high-stakes settings.

Method: The CSD framework utilizes a Swiss-system format of multi-round contests to pair models dynamically based on win-loss records, coupled with Monte Carlo Simulation and Failure Sensitivity Analysis to determine rankings and assess model robustness.

Result: CSD offers a statistically robust and context-aware ranking system by considering performance across benchmarks, handling noise, and characterizing models as robust generalists or aggressive specialists.

Conclusion: CSD enhances LLM evaluation by moving beyond static, fragmented scoring, offering a dynamic, risk-informed ranking system for better LLM capabilities assessment.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and diverse specialized benchmarks necessitates a shift from fragmented, task-specific metrics to a holistic, competitive ranking system that effectively aggregates performance across multiple ability dimensions. Primarily using static scoring, current evaluation methods are fundamentally limited. They struggle to determine the proper mix ratio across diverse benchmarks, and critically, they fail to capture a model's dynamic competitive fitness or its vulnerability when confronted with sequential, high-stakes tasks. To address this, we introduce the novel Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics (CSD) framework. CSD simulates a multi-round, sequential contest where models are dynamically paired across a curated sequence of benchmarks based on their accumulated win-loss record. And Monte Carlo Simulation ($N=100,000$ iterations) is used to approximate the statistically robust Expected Win Score ($E[S_m]$), which eliminates the noise of random pairing and early-round luck. Furthermore, we implement a Failure Sensitivity Analysis by parameterizing the per-round elimination quantity ($T_k$), which allows us to profile models based on their risk appetite--distinguishing between robust generalists and aggressive specialists. We demonstrate that CSD provides a more nuanced and context-aware ranking than traditional aggregate scoring and static pairwise models, representing a vital step towards risk-informed, next-generation LLM evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for accurate forecasting under challenging scenarios such as dynamic loads, tightly interdependent metrics, and rapidly changing backend environments in cloud native systems.

Method: The framework employs shared encoding, state fusion, cross-task structural propagation, and dynamic adjustment mechanisms to capture dependencies, trends, and disturbances effectively.

Result: Experimental analysis reveals superior performance, stability, and adaptability across various error metrics and operational conditions when compared to multiple benchmark models.

Conclusion: The framework offers essential predictive capabilities for high-dimensional, strongly dynamic cloud native backend systems, contributing to effective resource management and intelligent backend operations.

Abstract: This study proposes a unified forecasting framework for high-dimensional multi-task time series to meet the prediction demands of cloud native backend systems operating under highly dynamic loads, coupled metrics, and parallel tasks. The method builds a shared encoding structure to represent diverse monitoring indicators in a unified manner and employs a state fusion mechanism to capture trend changes and local disturbances across different time scales. A cross-task structural propagation module is introduced to model potential dependencies among nodes, enabling the model to understand complex structural patterns formed by resource contention, link interactions, and changes in service topology. To enhance adaptability to non-stationary behaviors, the framework incorporates a dynamic adjustment mechanism that automatically regulates internal feature flows according to system state changes, ensuring stable predictions in the presence of sudden load shifts, topology drift, and resource jitter. The experimental evaluation compares multiple models across various metrics and verifies the effectiveness of the framework through analyses of hyperparameter sensitivity, environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity. The results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance on several error metrics and provides more accurate representations of future states under different operating conditions. Overall, the unified forecasting framework offers reliable predictive capability for high-dimensional, multi-task, and strongly dynamic environments in cloud native systems and provides essential technical support for intelligent backend management.

TL;DR: The paper investigates single-layer Transformers' capabilities and limitations for modeling time-series data, highlighting the theoretical gaps in causality and dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the understanding gap in how Transformer models process dynamical data, contrasting them with well-established classical models in terms of their theoretical foundation.

Method: The paper interprets causal self-attention from a dynamical systems viewpoint, analyzing operations using linear and non-linear case studies. It identifies restrictions and capabilities based on inputs' temporal contexts.

Result: Linear systems are limited by softmax-induced oversmoothing in oscillatory scenarios. Nonlinear systems benefit from adaptive delay embeddings, which aid state reconstruction given sufficient context and dimensionality.

Conclusion: The paper connects empirical Transformer performance with dynamical systems theory, providing insights into their success or failure in dynamical data modeling.

Abstract: Transformers are increasingly adopted for modeling and forecasting time-series, yet their internal mechanisms remain poorly understood from a dynamical systems perspective. In contrast to classical autoregressive and state-space models, which benefit from well-established theoretical foundations, Transformer architectures are typically treated as black boxes. This gap becomes particularly relevant as attention-based models are considered for general-purpose or zero-shot forecasting across diverse dynamical regimes. In this work, we do not propose a new forecasting model, but instead investigate the representational capabilities and limitations of single-layer Transformers when applied to dynamical data. Building on a dynamical systems perspective we interpret causal self-attention as a linear, history-dependent recurrence and analyze how it processes temporal information. Through a series of linear and nonlinear case studies, we identify distinct operational regimes. For linear systems, we show that the convexity constraint imposed by softmax attention fundamentally restricts the class of dynamics that can be represented, leading to oversmoothing in oscillatory settings. For nonlinear systems under partial observability, attention instead acts as an adaptive delay-embedding mechanism, enabling effective state reconstruction when sufficient temporal context and latent dimensionality are available. These results help bridge empirical observations with classical dynamical systems theory, providing insight into when and why Transformers succeed or fail as models of dynamical systems.

*Shi Quan Foo,Chi-Ho Wong,Zhihan Gao,Dit-Yan Yeung,Ka-Hing Wong,Wai-Kin Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces STLDM, a novel diffusion-based model for precipitation nowcasting, achieving superior accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for precipitation nowcasting struggle with blurry predictions or poor accuracy due to the complexity and stochastic nature of the task.

Method: The proposed STLDM architecture combines a Variational Autoencoder, a conditioning network, and a latent diffusion model in two stages for deterministic forecasting and enhanced prediction.

Result: STLDM outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and inference efficiency on multiple radar datasets.

Conclusion: STLDM successfully addresses challenges in precipitation nowcasting and offers a more effective and efficient solution for extreme weather prediction.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting is a critical spatio-temporal prediction task for society to prevent severe damage owing to extreme weather events. Despite the advances in this field, the complex and stochastic nature of this task still poses challenges to existing approaches. Specifically, deterministic models tend to produce blurry predictions while generative models often struggle with poor accuracy. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective model architecture termed STLDM, a diffusion-based model that learns the latent representation from end to end alongside both the Variational Autoencoder and the conditioning network. STLDM decomposes this task into two stages: a deterministic forecasting stage handled by the conditioning network, and an enhancement stage performed by the latent diffusion model. Experimental results on multiple radar datasets demonstrate that STLDM achieves superior performance compared to the state of the art, while also improving inference efficiency.

*Qizhi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces BALLAST, an adaptive mechanism for Raft timeout selection that improves liveness under challenging network conditions via contextual bandits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the brittleness of randomized election timeouts in Raft under adverse network conditions such as long-tail latency, jitter, and partition recovery.

Method: BALLAST uses an online adaptation mechanism based on linear contextual bandits (LinUCB) coupled with safe exploration, replacing static timeout heuristics with adaptive, learned decisions.

Result: BALLAST significantly reduces recovery and unwritable times in difficult WAN scenarios and remains effective in stable LAN/WAN environments.

Conclusion: BALLAST outperforms traditional heuristics in dynamic and adverse conditions, offering a robust solution to liveness challenges in Raft.

Abstract: Randomized election timeouts are a simple and effective liveness heuristic for Raft, but they become brittle under long-tail latency, jitter, and partition recovery, where repeated split votes can inflate unavailability. This paper presents BALLAST, a lightweight online adaptation mechanism that replaces static timeout heuristics with contextual bandits. BALLAST selects from a discrete set of timeout "arms" using efficient linear contextual bandits (LinUCB variants), and augments learning with safe exploration to cap risk during unstable periods. We evaluate BALLAST on a reproducible discrete-event simulation with long-tail delay, loss, correlated bursts, node heterogeneity, and partition/recovery turbulence. Across challenging WAN regimes, BALLAST substantially reduces recovery time and unwritable time compared to standard randomized timeouts and common heuristics, while remaining competitive on stable LAN/WAN settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve EEG signal classification while addressing issues like non-stationarity, low signal-to-noise ratio, and limited labeled data.

Method: The authors propose U-GEPSVM, inspired by Universum learning and GEPSVM, and a more stable version, IU-GEPSVM, leveraging weighted difference-based formulations.

Result: IU-GEPSVM outperformed baseline methods, achieving peak accuracy of 85% and 80% for two binary EEG classification tasks using the Bonn University dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed Universum-enhanced classifiers are effective in improving EEG classification performance, demonstrating their potential in addressing key challenges in the field.

Abstract: The paper presents novel Universum-enhanced classifiers: the Universum Generalized Eigenvalue Proximal Support Vector Machine (U-GEPSVM) and the Improved U-GEPSVM (IU-GEPSVM) for EEG signal classification. Using the computational efficiency of generalized eigenvalue decomposition and the generalization benefits of Universum learning, the proposed models address critical challenges in EEG analysis: non-stationarity, low signal-to-noise ratio, and limited labeled data. U-GEPSVM extends the GEPSVM framework by incorporating Universum constraints through a ratio-based objective function, while IU-GEPSVM enhances stability through a weighted difference-based formulation that provides independent control over class separation and Universum alignment. The models are evaluated on the Bonn University EEG dataset across two binary classification tasks: (O vs S)-healthy (eyes closed) vs seizure, and (Z vs S)-healthy (eyes open) vs seizure. IU-GEPSVM achieves peak accuracies of 85% (O vs S) and 80% (Z vs S), with mean accuracies of 81.29% and 77.57% respectively, outperforming baseline methods.

### [190] [Analytic and Variational Stability of Deep Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21208)
*Ronald Katende*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to analyze stability in deep learning systems by considering coupled dynamics of representation and parameters, proposing a stability theorem and extending its applicability to non-smooth learning systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unifying description of stability in deep learning systems, considering representations, parameters, and update mechanisms along learning trajectories.

Method: The authors formulate a Learning Stability Profile, prove a Fundamental Analytic Stability Theorem, and extend their approach to both smooth and non-smooth dynamical systems using tools like Lyapunov energy dissipation and variational Lyapunov functionals.

Result: The framework leads to explicit stability metrics (e.g., stability exponents), stability laws for architectures and optimization methods, and unifies the description of sensitivity and robustness across different learning systems.

Conclusion: The framework provides a systematic way to understand stability across architectures, optimization methods, and could be extended to geometric and continuous-time formulations of learning dynamics.

Abstract: We propose a unified analytic and variational framework for studying stability in deep learning systems viewed as coupled representation-parameter dynamics. The central object is the Learning Stability Profile, which tracks the infinitesimal response of representations, parameters, and update mechanisms to perturbations along the learning trajectory. We prove a Fundamental Analytic Stability Theorem showing that uniform boundedness of these stability signatures is equivalent, up to norm equivalence, to the existence of a Lyapunov-type energy that dissipates along the learning flow. In smooth regimes, the framework yields explicit stability exponents linking spectral norms, activation regularity, step sizes, and learning rates to contractivity of the learning dynamics. Classical spectral stability results for feedforward networks, a discrete CFL-type condition for residual architectures, and parametric and temporal stability laws for stochastic gradient methods arise as direct consequences. The theory extends to non-smooth learning systems, including ReLU networks, proximal and projected updates, and stochastic subgradient flows, by replacing classical derivatives with Clarke generalized derivatives and smooth energies with variational Lyapunov functionals. The resulting framework provides a unified dynamical description of stability across architectures and optimization methods, clarifying how architectural and algorithmic choices jointly govern robustness and sensitivity to perturbations. It also provides a foundation for further extensions to continuous-time limits and geometric formulations of learning dynamics.

### [191] [MiST: Understanding the Role of Mid-Stage Scientific Training in Developing Chemical Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21231)
*Andres M Bran,Tong Xie,Shai Pranesh,Jeffrey Meng,Xuan Vu Nguyen,Jeremy Goumaz,David Ming Segura,Ruizhi Xu,Dongzhan Zhou,Wenjie Zhang,Bram Hoex,Philippe Schwaller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how large language models develop chemical reasoning via reinforcement learning, emphasizing prerequisites such as symbolic competence and latent chemical knowledge, and introduces mid-stage training to satisfy these conditions effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the constraints of reinforcement learning for reasoning in large language models, particularly in chemistry, and to address the lack of innate 'latent solvability' in these models for accurate chemical reasoning.

Method: The authors introduce 'Mid-Stage Scientific Training' (MiST), employing data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens to improve the models' latent solvability and reasoning ability.

Result: The proposed methods increased latent solvability scores for 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x. Reinforcement learning improved top-1 accuracy significantly for chemical tasks, such as organic reaction naming (10.9% to 63.9%) and inorganic material generation (40.6% to 67.4%), with interpretable reasoning traces.

Conclusion: Mid-stage training is crucial to equipping large language models with chemical reasoning capabilities, defining clear prerequisites for reinforcement learning, and positioning it as an effective technique for broader reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models can develop reasoning capabilities through online fine-tuning with rule-based rewards. However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Our results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities.

### [192] [Improving the Convergence Rate of Ray Search Optimization for Query-Efficient Hard-Label Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21241)
*Xinjie Xu,Shuyu Cheng,Dongwei Xu,Qi Xuan,Chen Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes ARS-OPT, a momentum-based algorithm inspired by Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient, and its enhanced version PARS-OPT, for improving the query efficiency of hard-label black-box adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments show that these methods outperform 13 state-of-the-art approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The query complexity in hard-label black-box adversarial attacks makes practical deployment challenging. There is a need for an efficient optimization method to reduce this complexity when determining the minimal $\ell_2$-norm perturbation for adversarial image manipulation.

Method: The paper introduces ARS-OPT, which uses momentum to infer future ray directions for gradient estimation, and its improved version, PARS-OPT, which incorporates surrogate-model priors for better convergence. Both methods are analyzed theoretically and validated empirically.

Result: ARS-OPT and PARS-OPT demonstrate superior query efficiency compared to 13 state-of-the-art methods. The results are supported by experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed ARS-OPT and PARS-OPT algorithms provide a significant improvement in optimizing hard-label black-box adversarial attacks, with faster convergence and enhanced stability, validated by theoretical evidence and comprehensive experiments.

Abstract: In hard-label black-box adversarial attacks, where only the top-1 predicted label is accessible, the prohibitive query complexity poses a major obstacle to practical deployment. In this paper, we focus on optimizing a representative class of attacks that search for the optimal ray direction yielding the minimum $\ell_2$-norm perturbation required to move a benign image into the adversarial region. Inspired by Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG), we propose a momentum-based algorithm, ARS-OPT, which proactively estimates the gradient with respect to a future ray direction inferred from accumulated momentum. We provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, showing that ARS-OPT enables more accurate directional updates and achieves faster, more stable optimization. To further accelerate convergence, we incorporate surrogate-model priors into ARS-OPT's gradient estimation, resulting in PARS-OPT with enhanced performance. The superiority of our approach is supported by theoretical guarantees under standard assumptions. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our method surpasses 13 state-of-the-art approaches in query efficiency.

### [193] [Model Merging via Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21288)
*Seyed Arshan Dalili,Mehrdad Mahdavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SAMerging, a method for model merging based on theory-driven approaches like flatness-aware PAC-Bayes bounds and multi-teacher knowledge distillation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of theoretical guarantees and robust methods in model merging, especially given challenges like data heterogeneity and reliance on heuristics, which can lead to brittle performance.

Method: It introduces a flatness-aware PAC-Bayes generalization bound, defines cross-task heterogeneity, and conceptualizes model merging as multi-teacher knowledge distillation. Further, it employs Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) through its proposed SAMerging method.

Result: The SAMerging method outperforms existing techniques, achieving state-of-the-art results across vision and NLP benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method not only advances the theoretical understanding of model merging but also demonstrates practical efficacy, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a lightweight alternative to joint multi-task learning (MTL), yet the generalization properties of merged models remain largely unexplored. Establishing such theoretical guarantees is non-trivial, as the merging process typically forbids access to the original training data and involves combining fine-tuned models trained on fundamentally heterogeneous data distributions. Without a principled understanding of these dynamics, current methods often rely on heuristics to approximate the optimal combination of parameters. This dependence is most critical in coefficient scaling, the weighting factors that modulate the magnitude of each fine-tuned model's contribution to the shared parameter. However, without a principled objective to guide their selection, these methods lead to brittle performance and are highly sensitive to scaling initialization. We address this gap by (i) establishing a novel flatness-aware PAC-Bayes generalization bound specifically for the model merging setting. This analysis introduces a "cross-task heterogeneity" term that formally captures the mismatch between diverse fine-tuned model priors and the target multi-task distributions. Guided by this theoretical insight, (ii) we frame model merging as multi-teacher knowledge distillation on scarce, unlabeled data. We formally demonstrate that minimizing the student-teacher Kullback-Leibler divergence directly tightens the upper bound on the merged model's excess risk. Guided by the flatness-aware bound derived, (iii) we operationalize this objective via SAMerging, a method that employs Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to find flat minima. Empirically, SAMerging establishes a new state of the art across vision and NLP benchmarks, achieving remarkable performance. The code is available at https://github.com/arshandalili/SAMerging.

TL;DR: This study develops an end-to-end computational framework that integrates transcriptomics and drug discovery for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), identifying biomarkers and generating personalized drug candidates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AML treatment is challenged by molecular heterogeneity and relapse, making precision medicine essential but insufficient for many patients.

Method: Transcriptomic biomarkers were identified using WGCNA. Targets were modeled with AlphaFold3, druggable sites mapped via DOGSiteScorer, and novel ligands generated using an evolutionary algorithm guided by hotspot data.

Result: Structural analysis produced unique chemical entities with promising drug-like features. Ligands showed strong binding affinity and were validated through ADMET profiling and docking studies.

Conclusion: This framework successfully combines systems biology and metaheuristic ligand assembly to create patient-specific drug candidates, improving precision oncology approaches for AML.

Abstract: Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) remains a clinical challenge due to its extreme molecular heterogeneity and high relapse rates. While precision medicine has introduced mutation-specific therapies, many patients still lack effective, personalized options. This paper presents a novel, end-to-end computational framework that bridges the gap between patient-specific transcriptomics and de novo drug discovery. By analyzing bulk RNA sequencing data from the TCGA-LAML cohort, the study utilized Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to prioritize 20 high-value biomarkers, including metabolic transporters like HK3 and immune-modulatory receptors such as SIGLEC9. The physical structures of these targets were modeled using AlphaFold3, and druggable hotspots were quantitatively mapped via the DOGSiteScorer engine. Then developed a novel, reaction-first evolutionary metaheuristic algorithm as well as multi-objective optimization programming that assembles novel ligands from fragment libraries, guided by spatial alignment to these identified hotspots. The generative model produced structurally unique chemical entities with a strong bias toward drug-like space, as evidenced by QED scores peaking between 0.5 and 0.7. Validation through ADMET profiling and SwissDock molecular docking identified high-confidence candidates, such as Ligand L1, which achieved a binding free energy of -6.571 kcal/mol against the A08A96 biomarker. These results demonstrate that integrating systems biology with metaheuristic molecular assembly can produce pharmacologically viable, patient tailored leads, offering a scalable blueprint for precision oncology in AML and beyond

*Lilian Welschinger,Yilin Liu,Zican Wang,Niloy Mitra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a mesh-free method to solve surface PDEs directly on neural shape representations, enabling end-to-end workflows without explicit meshing or residual training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing prevalence of neural (3D asset) surface representations has created a need to solve PDEs directly in the neural domain, as prevailing methods rely on triangle meshes incompatible with modern data formats.

Method: The authors propose a mesh-free local update operator trained on neural shape attributes, enabling surface PDEs to be solved directly in neural representations. The operator generalizes across shapes, topologies, and avoids explicit meshing or per-instance optimization.

Result: Their method performs slightly better than CPM and is close to FEM accuracy in various benchmarks, including analytic scenarios and real neural surfaces.

Conclusion: The method combines speed, accuracy, and generalizability, delivering an efficient end-to-end pipeline for solving surface PDEs on neural and classical representations.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on shapes underpins many shape analysis and engineering tasks; yet, prevailing PDE solvers operate on polygonal/triangle meshes while modern 3D assets increasingly live as neural representations. This mismatch leaves no suitable method to solve surface PDEs directly within the neural domain, forcing explicit mesh extraction or per-instance residual training, preventing end-to-end workflows. We present a novel, mesh-free formulation that learns a local update operator conditioned on neural (local) shape attributes, enabling surface PDEs to be solved directly where the (neural) data lives. The operator integrates naturally with prevalent neural surface representations, is trained once on a single representative shape, and generalizes across shape and topology variations, enabling accurate, fast inference without explicit meshing or per-instance optimization while preserving differentiability. Across analytic benchmarks (heat equation and Poisson solve on sphere) and real neural assets across different representations, our method slightly outperforms CPM while remaining reasonably close to FEM, and, to our knowledge, delivers the first end-to-end pipeline that solves surface PDEs on both neural and classical surface representations. Code will be released on acceptance.

### [196] [Anytime Metaheuristic Framework for Global Route Optimization in Expected-Time Mobile Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20711)
*Jan Mikula,Miroslav Kulich*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the expected-time mobile search problem in static 2D environments using a novel framework called Milaps, which offers significant improvements in optimization quality and runtime efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the intractability of global optimization in Expected-time mobile search (ETS) caused by continuous environments and motion-visibility constraints.

Method: Developed Milaps framework, incorporating auxiliary objectives and leveraging a metaheuristic for the traveling deliveryman problem for efficient global optimization.

Result: Milaps showed superior performance in balancing solution quality and runtime compared to existing methods, validated through a large-scale dataset evaluation.

Conclusion: The Milaps framework is efficient, flexible, and showcases potential across diverse scenarios, demonstrating improvement over state-of-the-art techniques in ETS optimization.

Abstract: Expected-time mobile search (ETS) is a fundamental robotics task where a mobile sensor navigates an environment to minimize the expected time required to locate a hidden object. Global route optimization for ETS in static 2D continuous environments remains largely underexplored due to the intractability of objective evaluation, stemming from the continuous nature of the environment and the interplay of motion and visibility constraints. Prior work has addressed this through partial discretization, leading to discrete-sensing formulations tackled via utility-greedy heuristics. Others have taken an indirect approach by heuristically approximating the objective using minimum latency problems on fixed graphs, enabling global route optimization via efficient metaheuristics. This paper builds on and significantly extends the latter by introducing Milaps (Minimum latency problems), a model-based solution framework for ETS. Milaps integrates novel auxiliary objectives and adapts a recent anytime metaheuristic for the traveling deliveryman problem, chosen for its strong performance under tight runtime constraints. Evaluations on a novel large-scale dataset demonstrate superior trade-offs between solution quality and runtime compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The best-performing strategy rapidly generates a preliminary solution, assigns static weights to sensing configurations, and optimizes global costs metaheuristically. Additionally, a qualitative study highlights the framework's flexibility across diverse scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a versatile, vision-based framework for intercepting dynamic, non-cooperative targets using just a monocular camera, validated on three platforms: UAVs, ground rovers, and spacecraft. It handles challenges like partial observability and no global localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified interception framework capable of robust performance across diverse robotic systems while overcoming challenges like limited sensor observability and lack of global localization.

Method: The method combines an Extended Kalman Filter for relative pose estimation, a motion predictor for target trajectory propagation, and a receding-horizon planner to compute real-time, kinematically feasible interception paths.

Result: Physical and simulated experiments across various platforms show high success rates and low interception errors even in challenging conditions, demonstrating the approach's robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework offers a generalized, effective, and compute-efficient solution for dynamic target interception, applicable across heterogeneous robotic systems with limited observability and no global localization.

Abstract: This paper presents a general purpose framework for autonomous, vision-based interception of dynamic, non-cooperative targets, validated across three distinct mobility platforms: an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a four-wheeled ground rover, and an air-thruster spacecraft testbed. The approach relies solely on a monocular camera with fiducials for target tracking and operates entirely in the local observer frame without the need for global information. The core contribution of this work is a streamlined and general approach to autonomous interception that can be adapted across robots with varying dynamics, as well as our comprehensive study of the robot interception problem across heterogenous mobility systems under limited observability and no global localization. Our method integrates (1) an Extended Kalman Filter for relative pose estimation amid intermittent measurements, (2) a history-conditioned motion predictor for dynamic target trajectory propagation, and (3) a receding-horizon planner solving a constrained convex program in real time to ensure time-efficient and kinematically feasible interception paths. Our operating regime assumes that observability is restricted by partial fields of view, sensor dropouts, and target occlusions. Experiments are performed in these conditions and include autonomous UAV landing on dynamic targets, rover rendezvous and leader-follower tasks, and spacecraft proximity operations. Results from simulated and physical experiments demonstrate robust performance with low interception errors (both during station-keeping and upon scenario completion), high success rates under deterministic and stochastic target motion profiles, and real-time execution on embedded processors such as the Jetson Orin, VOXL2, and Raspberry Pi 5. These results highlight the framework's generalizability, robustness, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The YCB-Handovers dataset provides valuable data for developing weight-sensitive motion planning and adaptive robot behaviors, aiding the advancement of intuitive human-robot collaboration models.

Abstract: This paper introduces the YCB-Handovers dataset, capturing motion data of 2771 human-human handovers with varying object weights. The dataset aims to bridge a gap in human-robot collaboration research, providing insights into the impact of object weight in human handovers and readiness cues for intuitive robotic motion planning. The underlying dataset for object recognition and tracking is the YCB (Yale-CMU-Berkeley) dataset, which is an established standard dataset used in algorithms for robotic manipulation, including grasping and carrying objects. The YCB-Handovers dataset incorporates human motion patterns in handovers, making it applicable for data-driven, human-inspired models aimed at weight-sensitive motion planning and adaptive robotic behaviors. This dataset covers an extensive range of weights, allowing for a more robust study of handover behavior and weight variation. Some objects also require careful handovers, highlighting contrasts with standard handovers. We also provide a detailed analysis of the object's weight impact on the human reaching motion in these handovers.

TL;DR: This paper studies instability in feedback systems due to incremental damage and explores the use of dynamical indicators of resilience as a system safety monitor, which doesn't rely on traditional modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the fragility caused by incremental damage in feedback systems which leads to loss of control and instability, especially when traditional methods fail without accurate system models.

Method: The paper utilizes the concept of critical slowing down from nonlinear systems as a dynamical indicator to monitor stability without requiring system models.

Result: The findings indicate the feasibility of using these resilience indicators for real-time early warnings and resilient system design, demonstrated on drones but applicable to a broader range of systems.

Conclusion: The study concludes that dynamical indicators of resilience offer a generic and effective method to monitor system safety, applicable across diverse controlled systems.

Abstract: Maintaining stability in feedback systems, from aircraft and autonomous robots to biological and physiological systems, relies on monitoring their behavior and continuously adjusting their inputs. Incremental damage can make such control fragile. This tends to go unnoticed until a small perturbation induces instability (i.e. loss of control). Traditional methods in the field of engineering rely on accurate system models to compute a safe set of operating instructions, which become invalid when the, possibly damaged, system diverges from its model. Here we demonstrate that the approach of such a feedback system towards instability can nonetheless be monitored through dynamical indicators of resilience. This holistic system safety monitor does not rely on a system model and is based on the generic phenomenon of critical slowing down, shown to occur in the climate, biology and other complex nonlinear systems approaching criticality. Our findings for engineered devices opens up a wide range of applications involving real-time early warning systems as well as an empirical guidance of resilient system design exploration, or "tinkering". While we demonstrate the validity using drones, the generic nature of the underlying principles suggest that these indicators could apply across a wider class of controlled systems including reactors, aircraft, and self-driving cars.

*Kanata Suzuki,Shota Shimizu,Tetsuya Ogata*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study evaluates Vision Language Models (VLMs) for understanding robot motion through video captioning, aiming to connect robot motion data with language for better imitation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ascertain if foundation models trained on offline data can comprehend robot motion, thereby enhancing understanding in robotics for trajectory and video understanding.

Method: The method generates scene captions using image and trajectory data, then summarizes them for task captions. It also segments subtasks by comparing text embeddings based on similarity.

Result: Simulator experiments validate the effectiveness of incorporating robot motion data into VLMs for improved captioning and segmentation outcomes.

Conclusion: Integrating low-level motion data into VLMs boosts their ability to link language and motion, potentially aiding in efficient robot imitation learning.

Abstract: From the perspective of future developments in robotics, it is crucial to verify whether foundation models trained exclusively on offline data, such as images and language, can understand the robot motion. In particular, since Vision Language Models (VLMs) do not include low-level motion information from robots in their training datasets, video understanding including trajectory information remains a significant challenge. In this study, we assess two capabilities of VLMs through a video captioning task with low-level robot motion information: (1) automatic captioning of robot tasks and (2) segmentation of a series of tasks. Both capabilities are expected to enhance the efficiency of robot imitation learning by linking language and motion and serve as a measure of the foundation model's performance. The proposed method generates multiple "scene" captions using image captions and trajectory data from robot tasks. The full task caption is then generated by summarizing these individual captions. Additionally, the method performs subtask segmentation by comparing the similarity between text embeddings of image captions. In both captioning tasks, the proposed method aims to improve performance by providing the robot's motion data - joint and end-effector states - as input to the VLM.

*Yiding Nie,Dongliang Fan,Jiatai Huang,Chunyu Liu,Jian S. Dai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a stretchable tactile sensor with a novel continuous spectral-filtering principle, offering high resolution, scalability, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the limitations of current stretchable tactile sensors, including achieving high spatial resolution, self-decoupling capacity, and insensitivity to off-axis stimuli.

Method: The proposed method is based on implementing a continuous spectral-filtering principle within stretchable tactile sensors, improving spatial and force resolution.

Result: The sensor achieves high-linear spatial response during stretching and bending, continuous spatial (7 μm) and force (5 mN) resolutions, and robustness under piercing and cutting.

Conclusion: The developed tactile sensor provides exceptional resolution and robustness, with practical applications demonstrated via precise trajectory tracking for a planar parallel mechanism.

Abstract: Stretchable sensors indicate promising prospects for soft robotics, medical devices, and human-machine interactions due to the high compliance of soft materials. Discrete sensing strategies, including sensor arrays and distributed sensors, are broadly involved in tactile sensors across versatile applications. However, it remains a challenge to achieve high spatial resolution with self-decoupled capacity and insensitivity to other off-axis stimuli for stretchable tactile sensors. Herein, we develop a stretchable tactile sensor based on the proposed continuous spectral-filtering principle, allowing superhigh resolution for applied stimuli. This proposed sensor enables a high-linear spatial response (0.996) even during stretching and bending, and high continuous spatial (7 μm) and force (5 mN) resolutions with design scalability and interaction robustness to survive piercing and cutting. We further demonstrate the sensors' performance by integrating them into a planar parallel mechanism for precise trajectory tracking (rotational resolution: 0.02°) in real time.

*Baoshan Song,Matthew Giamou,Penggao Yan,Chunxi Xia,Li-Ta Hsu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a globally optimal solver for GNSS-based system alignment in degraded environments, addressing issues like local minima and satellite dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail in GNSS-degraded environments and suffer from local minima and dependency on abundant satellites, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: The authors developed a certified solver by formulating the problem as a nonconvex QCQP problem and relaxing it into a concave Lagrangian dual problem. They analyzed relaxation tightness and observability for optimality and validated their approach via simulations and real-world experiments.

Result: The proposed solver generates certifiably optimal solutions for GNSS alignment with minimal satellite data (2 satellites using Doppler measurements in 2D vehicle motion), outperforming traditional methods like VOBA and GVINS in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The solver ensures global optimality and robustness for GNSS alignment, addressing alignment challenges in degraded environments. The open-sourced code and data enhance future development.

Abstract: Estimating the absolute orientation of a local system relative to a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) reference often suffers from local minima and high dependency on satellite availability. Existing methods for this alignment task rely on abundant satellites unavailable in GNSS-degraded environments, or use local optimization methods which cannot guarantee the optimality of a solution. This work introduces a globally optimal solver that transforms raw pseudo-range or Doppler measurements into a convexly relaxed problem. The proposed method is certifiable, meaning it can numerically verify the correctness of the result, filling a gap where existing local optimizers fail. We first formulate the original frame alignment problem as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) problem and relax the QCQP problem to a concave Lagrangian dual problem that provides a lower cost bound for the original problem. Then we perform relaxation tightness and observability analysis to derive criteria for certifiable optimality of the solution. Finally, simulation and real world experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method. The experiments show that our method provides certifiably optimal solutions even with only 2 satellites with Doppler measurements and 2D vehicle motion, while the traditional velocity-based VOBA method and the advanced GVINS alignment technique may fail or converge to local optima without notice. To support the development of GNSS-based navigation techniques in robotics, all code and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/Baoshan-Song/Certifiable-Doppler-alignment.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes ETP-R1, a framework to enhance graph-based Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) models by using scaled data, joint pretraining, and advanced reinforcement fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to bridge the performance gap between graph-based methods and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in VLN-CE tasks by addressing the challenges of leveraging large-scale data and employing advanced training strategies.

Method: The proposed framework, ETP-R1, introduces a high-quality large-scale pretraining dataset using the Gemini API, unifies data from R2R and RxR tasks, and adopts a three-stage training paradigm which includes closed-loop, online reinforcement fine-tuning with the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm.

Result: ETP-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks (R2R-CE and RxR-CE) across all metrics, showcasing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Scaling up data and applying reinforcement fine-tuning techniques can significantly enhance graph-based VLN-CE models, narrowing the gap with LVLM-based methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires an embodied agent to navigate towards target in continuous environments, following natural language instructions. While current graph-based methods offer an efficient, structured approach by abstracting the environment into a topological map and simplifying the action space to waypoint selection, they lag behind methods based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in leveraging large-scale data and advanced training paradigms. In this paper, we try to bridge this gap by introducing ETP-R1, a framework that applies the paradigm of scaling up data and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to a graph-based VLN-CE model. To build a strong foundation, we first construct a high-quality, large-scale pretraining dataset using the Gemini API. This dataset consists of diverse, low-hallucination instructions for topological trajectories, providing rich supervision for our graph-based policy to map language to topological paths. This foundation is further strengthened by unifying data from both R2R and RxR tasks for joint pretraining. Building on this, we introduce a three-stage training paradigm, which culminates in the first application of closed-loop, online RFT to a graph-based VLN-CE model, powered by the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is highly effective, establishing new state-of-the-art performance across all major metrics on both the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks.

*Jiangen He,Wanqi Zhang,Jessica Barfield*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper investigates how societal biases influence human preferences for artificial agents in different professional contexts, analyzing discriminatory patterns based on skin tone and anthropomorphic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As robots integrate into workplaces, understanding how human biases toward race and stereotypes impact robot selection is critical to prevent perpetuation of social inequalities.

Method: The researchers conducted two experiments with 1,038 participants, evaluating robotic preferences across occupational contexts like healthcare, education, construction, and athletics. They examined skin tone, anthropomorphic traits, and impacts of stereotype exposure.

Result: Healthcare and educational fields favored lighter-skinned robots, while construction and athletics showed greater acceptance of darker robots. Participants' racial backgrounds influenced preferences, and exposure to human stereotypes altered robot preferences.

Conclusion: Biases in human-robot choice reflect occupational and racial stereotypes, suggesting robots may unintentionally perpetuate existing social disparities if these biases are not addressed.

Abstract: As artificial agents increasingly integrate into professional environments, fundamental questions have emerged about how societal biases influence human-robot selection decisions. We conducted two comprehensive experiments (N = 1,038) examining how occupational contexts and stereotype activation shape robotic agent choices across construction, healthcare, educational, and athletic domains. Participants made selections from artificial agents that varied systematically in skin tone and anthropomorphic characteristics. Our study revealed distinct context-dependent patterns. Healthcare and educational scenarios demonstrated strong favoritism toward lighter-skinned artificial agents, while construction and athletic contexts showed greater acceptance of darker-toned alternatives. Participant race was associated with systematic differences in selection patterns across professional domains. The second experiment demonstrated that exposure to human professionals from specific racial backgrounds systematically shifted later robotic agent preferences in stereotype-consistent directions. These findings show that occupational biases and color-based discrimination transfer directly from human-human to human-robot evaluation contexts. The results highlight mechanisms through which robotic deployment may unintentionally perpetuate existing social inequalities.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new sensor combining tactile imaging and force sensing for robotic palpation, improving subsurface feature detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of force signals in detecting subtle subsurface features in soft-tissue environments during robotic palpation.

Method: Development of a compact sensor integrating high-resolution tactile imaging and a 6-axis force sensor, tested on silicone phantoms with varying subsurface geometries.

Result: Tactile images provided detailed information on subsurface structures, while force tracking ensured controlled interaction. Combining the modalities improved detection and safe robotic palpation.

Conclusion: Integrating tactile and force sensing enhances the capability and safety of robotic palpation for detecting subsurface features.

Abstract: Robotic palpation relies on force sensing, but force signals in soft-tissue environments are variable and cannot reliably reveal subtle subsurface features. We present a compact multimodal sensor that integrates high-resolution vision-based tactile imaging with a 6-axis force-torque sensor. In experiments on silicone phantoms with diverse subsurface tendon geometries, force signals alone frequently produce ambiguous responses, while tactile images reveal clear structural differences in presence, diameter, depth, crossings, and multiplicity. Yet accurate force tracking remains essential for maintaining safe, consistent contact during physiotherapeutic interaction. Preliminary results show that combining tactile and force modalities enables robust subsurface feature detection and controlled robotic palpation.

*Cheng-Yu Kuo,Hirofumi Shin,Takamitsu Matsubara*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a tactile-based method enabling robotic hands to dynamically adjust grasping force and minimize slippage using a physics-informed energy abstraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of controlling robotic grasping force during dynamic tasks when external sensing is unreliable and objects have unknown properties.

Method: The method involves modeling objects as virtual energy containers, leveraging the energy dynamics inconsistency, and using model-based learning to optimize real-time grasping force based on tactile data.

Result: The proposed approach allows robotic systems to learn grasp control in minutes, reduce slippage, and extend grasp durations across various conditions without relying on external sensors or prior object knowledge.

Conclusion: This method enhances robotic manipulation through rapid tactile-driven learning and force optimization, offering improved autonomy in handling unknown objects and conditions.

Abstract: Regulating grasping force to reduce slippage during dynamic object interaction remains a fundamental challenge in robotic manipulation, especially when objects are manipulated by multiple rolling contacts, have unknown properties (such as mass or surface conditions), and when external sensing is unreliable. In contrast, humans can quickly regulate grasping force by touch, even without visual cues. Inspired by this ability, we aim to enable robotic hands to rapidly explore objects and learn tactile-driven grasping force control under motion and limited sensing. We propose a physics-informed energy abstraction that models the object as a virtual energy container. The inconsistency between the fingers' applied power and the object's retained energy provides a physically grounded signal for inferring slip-aware stability. Building on this abstraction, we employ model-based learning and planning to efficiently model energy dynamics from tactile sensing and perform real-time grasping force optimization. Experiments in both simulation and hardware demonstrate that our method can learn grasping force control from scratch within minutes, effectively reduce slippage, and extend grasp duration across diverse motion-object pairs, all without relying on external sensing or prior object knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenging problem in robotic grasping—aligning linguistic task instructions with visual grasp reasoning—current methods' shallow fusion strategies limit their effectiveness.

Method: LGGD integrates a coarse-to-fine learning paradigm, hierarchical CLIP-based cross-modal fusion, and an adaptive language-conditioned dynamic convolution head for better visual-semantic grounding in grasp detection.

Result: Experiments using the OCID-VLG and Grasp-Anything++ datasets demonstrate that LGGD surpasses existing methods with improved generalization to unseen scenarios and objects; real robotic deployments validate its accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed LGGD method effectively aligns linguistic instructions with visual processing, improving task-adaptive robotic grasping, supporting its potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Grasping is one of the most fundamental challenging capabilities in robotic manipulation, especially in unstructured, cluttered, and semantically diverse environments. Recent researches have increasingly explored language-guided manipulation, where robots not only perceive the scene but also interpret task-relevant natural language instructions. However, existing language-conditioned grasping methods typically rely on shallow fusion strategies, leading to limited semantic grounding and weak alignment between linguistic intent and visual grasp reasoning.In this work, we propose Language-Guided Grasp Detection (LGGD) with a coarse-to-fine learning paradigm for robotic manipulation. LGGD leverages CLIP-based visual and textual embeddings within a hierarchical cross-modal fusion pipeline, progressively injecting linguistic cues into the visual feature reconstruction process. This design enables fine-grained visual-semantic alignment and improves the feasibility of the predicted grasps with respect to task instructions. In addition, we introduce a language-conditioned dynamic convolution head (LDCH) that mixes multiple convolution experts based on sentence-level features, enabling instruction-adaptive coarse mask and grasp predictions. A final refinement module further enhances grasp consistency and robustness in complex scenes.Experiments on the OCID-VLG and Grasp-Anything++ datasets show that LGGD surpasses existing language-guided grasping methods, exhibiting strong generalization to unseen objects and diverse language queries. Moreover, deployment on a real robotic platform demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach in executing accurate, instruction-conditioned grasp actions. The code will be released publicly upon acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight robotic arm design for aerial manipulators, combined with reinforcement learning for precise control and disturbance resistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a lightweight and mechanically simple aerial manipulation system that reduces payload while overcoming challenges like underactuation and external disturbances.

Method: A quadrotor-mounted 2-DoF robotic arm controlled by reinforcement learning (PPO agent), combining feedforward commands with INDI attitude and PID joint controllers.

Result: Experiments demonstrated high precision (centimeter-level accuracy, degree-level orientation) and robustness against external disturbances during aerial manipulation.

Conclusion: Learning-based control methods can enhance aerial manipulation capabilities, enabling performance with lightweight and minimal designs.

Abstract: Aerial manipulators, which combine robotic arms with multi-rotor drones, face strict constraints on arm weight and mechanical complexity. In this work, we study a lightweight 2-degree-of-freedom (DoF) arm mounted on a quadrotor via a differential mechanism, capable of full six-DoF end-effector pose control. While the minimal design enables simplicity and reduced payload, it also introduces challenges such as underactuation and sensitivity to external disturbances, including manipulation of heavy loads and pushing tasks. To address these, we employ reinforcement learning, training a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent in simulation to generate feedforward commands for quadrotor acceleration and body rates, along with joint angle targets. These commands are tracked by an incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) attitude controller and a PID joint controller, respectively. Flight experiments demonstrate centimeter-level position accuracy and degree-level orientation precision, with robust performance under external force disturbances. The results highlight the potential of learning-based control strategies for enabling contact-rich aerial manipulation using simple, lightweight platforms.

*Chen Liang,Daniel Rakita*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Web of Affine Spaces (WASP) derivatives in the MuJoCo MPC library to optimize Model Predictive Control (MPC) tasks, improving computational efficiency and performance compared to traditional finite differencing (FD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finite differencing (FD) slows down derivative computations in the MJPC library, limiting its application for time-sensitive tasks, especially in high-degree-of-freedom systems.

Method: The authors integrated WASP derivatives into MJPC as a substitute for FD, leveraging its efficient derivative approximation capabilities using prior computations.

Result: WASP derivatives achieved up to 2x speedup compared to FD in MJPC tasks and surpassed stochastic sampling-based planners in efficiency and reliability.

Conclusion: WASP derivatives provide significant computational and performance benefits for MPC in MJPC, and the authors have made a fully integrated WASP-enabled MJPC publicly available for broader usage.

Abstract: MuJoCo is a powerful and efficient physics simulator widely used in robotics. One common way it is applied in practice is through Model Predictive Control (MPC), which uses repeated rollouts of the simulator to optimize future actions and generate responsive control policies in real time. To make this process more accessible, the open source library MuJoCo MPC (MJPC) provides ready-to-use MPC algorithms and implementations built directly on top of the MuJoCo simulator. However, MJPC relies on finite differencing (FD) to compute derivatives through the underlying MuJoCo simulator, which is often a key bottleneck that can make it prohibitively costly for time-sensitive tasks, especially in high-DOF systems or complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce the use of Web of Affine Spaces (WASP) derivatives within MJPC as a drop-in replacement for FD. WASP is a recently developed approach for efficiently computing sequences of accurate derivative approximations. By reusing information from prior, related derivative calculations, WASP accelerates and stabilizes the computation of new derivatives, making it especially well suited for MPC's iterative, fine-grained updates over time. We evaluate WASP across a diverse suite of MJPC tasks spanning multiple robot embodiments. Our results suggest that WASP derivatives are particularly effective in MJPC: it integrates seamlessly across tasks, delivers consistently robust performance, and achieves up to a 2$\mathsf{x}$ speedup compared to an FD backend when used with derivative-based planners, such as iLQG. In addition, WASP-based MPC outperforms MJPC's stochastic sampling-based planners on our evaluation tasks, offering both greater efficiency and reliability. To support adoption and future research, we release an open-source implementation of MJPC with WASP derivatives fully integrated.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces SparScene, a sparse graph learning framework for multi-agent trajectory generation, excelling in scalability and efficiency using a structure-aware sparse connection approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-agent trajectory modeling struggle with inefficiencies caused by redundant graph connections and complex network structures, limiting scalability in large, complex traffic scenes.

Method: SparScene uses lane graph topology to create sparse yet structure-aware connections between agents and lanes, combined with a lightweight graph encoder to efficiently manage agent-map and agent-agent interactions.

Result: SparScene demonstrates competitive motion prediction on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, enabling trajectory generation for over 200 agents in 5 ms and scaling up to over 5,000 agents and 17,000 lanes with minimal inference time and resource consumption.

Conclusion: SparScene provides an efficient, scalable solution for traffic scene representation, outperforming existing methods in handling large-scale traffic scenarios with high performance and low resource use.

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory generation is a core problem for autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems. However, efficiently modeling the dynamic interactions between numerous road users and infrastructures in complex scenes remains an open problem. Existing methods typically employ distance-based or fully connected dense graph structures to capture interaction information, which not only introduces a large number of redundant edges but also requires complex and heavily parameterized networks for encoding, thereby resulting in low training and inference efficiency, limiting scalability to large and complex traffic scenes. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose SparScene, a sparse graph learning framework designed for efficient and scalable traffic scene representation. Instead of relying on distance thresholds, SparScene leverages the lane graph topology to construct structure-aware sparse connections between agents and lanes, enabling efficient yet informative scene graph representation. SparScene adopts a lightweight graph encoder that efficiently aggregates agent-map and agent-agent interactions, yielding compact scene representations with substantially improved efficiency and scalability. On the motion prediction benchmark of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), SparScene achieves competitive performance with remarkable efficiency. It generates trajectories for more than 200 agents in a scene within 5 ms and scales to more than 5,000 agents and 17,000 lanes with merely 54 ms of inference time with a GPU memory of 2.9 GB, highlighting its superior scalability for large-scale traffic scenes.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a minimal interaction-based 3D flocking algorithm for drone swarms, revealing various collective phases and their dynamic benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to design efficient autonomous aerial swarms inspired by the collective motion of animal groups, focusing on minimal interaction rules among drones.

Method: The authors introduce a bio-inspired flocking algorithm tuned using alignment and attraction parameters, validated through outdoor experiments with drones and simulations.

Result: The swarm demonstrates critical behaviors such as responsiveness to disturbances, collective turns, transient expansions, and recovery with optimized interaction rules.

Conclusion: Minimal local-interaction rules effectively generate diverse collective behaviors, and gain modulation provides an efficient tool for enhanced stability, flexibility, and resilience in drone swarms.

Abstract: Collective motion inspired by animal groups offers powerful design principles for autonomous aerial swarms. We present a bio-inspired 3D flocking algorithm in which each drone interacts only with a minimal set of influential neighbors, relying solely on local alignment and attraction cues. By systematically tuning these two interaction gains, we map a phase diagram revealing sharp transitions between swarming and schooling, as well as a critical region where susceptibility, polarization fluctuations, and reorganization capacity peak. Outdoor experiments with a swarm of ten drones, combined with simulations using a calibrated flight-dynamics model, show that operating near this transition enhances responsiveness to external disturbances. When confronted with an intruder, the swarm performs rapid collective turns, transient expansions, and reliably recovers high alignment within seconds. These results demonstrate that minimal local-interaction rules are sufficient to generate multiple collective phases and that simple gain modulation offers an efficient mechanism to adjust stability, flexibility, and resilience in drone swarms.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Schrödinger's Navigator, a framework improving zero-shot object navigation by imagining future observations to address occlusions, risks, and moving targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot object navigation systems struggle to handle realistic environments with occlusions, unknown risks, or dynamically moving targets, necessitating a more robust navigation approach.

Method: The proposed framework uses egocentric visual inputs and candidate trajectories to imagine future 3D observations via a trajectory-conditioned model, fusing these updates to inform navigation policies.

Result: Experiments on a robot demonstrate superior performance in localization and navigation compared to existing methods across challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: Schrödinger's Navigator leverages trajectory-based 3D imagination to significantly enhance robustness and success in cluttered, occlusion-heavy environments for zero-shot object navigation.

Abstract: Zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) requires a robot to locate a target object in a previously unseen environment without relying on pre-built maps or task-specific training. However, existing ZSON methods often struggle in realistic and cluttered environments, particularly when the scene contains heavy occlusions, unknown risks, or dynamically moving target objects. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Schrödinger's Navigator}, a navigation framework inspired by Schrödinger's thought experiment on uncertainty. The framework treats unobserved space as a set of plausible future worlds and reasons over them before acting. Conditioned on egocentric visual inputs and three candidate trajectories, a trajectory-conditioned 3D world model imagines future observations along each path. This enables the agent to see beyond occlusions and anticipate risks in unseen regions without requiring extra detours or dense global mapping. The imagined 3D observations are fused into the navigation map and used to update a value map. These updates guide the policy toward trajectories that avoid occlusions, reduce exposure to uncertain space, and better track moving targets. Experiments on a Go2 quadruped robot across three challenging scenarios, including severe static occlusions, unknown risks, and dynamically moving targets, show that Schrödinger's Navigator consistently outperforms strong ZSON baselines in self-localization, object localization, and overall Success Rate in occlusion-heavy environments. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of trajectory-conditioned 3D imagination in enabling robust zero-shot object navigation.

Result: Experiments showed the load sensors have a minimal error (14.8 g), and the system maintained balance 100% during single-leg tasks on uneven surfaces with optimized PID parameters.

Conclusion: Wireless feedback systems can effectively improve humanoid robot stability and flexibility, especially in tasks requiring high mechanical freedom, such as dancing.

Abstract: Maintaining stability during the single-support phase is a fundamental challenge in humanoid robotics, particularly in dance robots that require complex maneuvers and high mechanical freedom. Traditional tethered sensor configurations often restrict joint movement and introduce mechanical noises. This study proposes a wireless embedded balance system designed to maintain stability on uneven surfaces. The system utilizes a custom-designed foot unit integrated with four load cells and an ESP32-C3 microcontroller to estimate the Center of Pressure (CoP) in real time. The CoP data were transmitted wirelessly to the main controller to minimize the wiring complexity of the 29-DoF VI-ROSE humanoid robot. A PID control strategy is implemented to adjust the torso, hip, and ankle roll joints based on CoP feedback. Experimental characterization demonstrated high sensor precision with an average measurement error of 14.8 g. Furthermore, the proposed control system achieved a 100% success rate in maintaining balance during single-leg lifting tasks at a 3-degree inclination with optimized PID parameters (Kp=0.10, Kd=0.005). These results validate the efficacy of wireless CoP feedback in enhancing the postural stability of humanoid robots, without compromising their mechanical flexibility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic tactile sensing for dexterous manipulation remains limited by challenges in collecting and transferring large-scale tactile data from humans to robots.

Method: The authors propose UniTacHand, a unified representation that standardizes tactile signals onto a 2D surface of a hand model and utilizes contrastive learning to align human and robotic tactile data.

Result: The system achieves zero-shot policy transfer from human to robot, demonstrates generalization to new objects, and improves efficiency when integrating human and robotic data.

Conclusion: UniTacHand offers a standardized and scalable solution for data-efficient tactile-based robotic learning, advancing dexterous manipulation in robotics.

Abstract: Tactile sensing is crucial for robotic hands to achieve human-level dexterous manipulation, especially in scenarios with visual occlusion. However, its application is often hindered by the difficulty of collecting large-scale real-world robotic tactile data. In this study, we propose to collect low-cost human manipulation data using haptic gloves for tactile-based robotic policy learning. The misalignment between human and robotic tactile data makes it challenging to transfer policies learned from human data to robots. To bridge this gap, we propose UniTacHand, a unified representation to align robotic tactile information captured by dexterous hands with human hand touch obtained from gloves. First, we project tactile signals from both human hands and robotic hands onto a morphologically consistent 2D surface space of the MANO hand model. This unification standardizes the heterogeneous data structures and inherently embeds the tactile signals with spatial context. Then, we introduce a contrastive learning method to align them into a unified latent space, trained on only 10 minutes of paired data from our data collection system. Our approach enables zero-shot tactile-based policy transfer from humans to a real robot, generalizing to objects unseen in the pre-training data. We also demonstrate that co-training on mixed data, including both human and robotic demonstrations via UniTacHand, yields better performance and data efficiency compared with using only robotic data. UniTacHand paves a path toward general, scalable, and data-efficient learning for tactile-based dexterous hands.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data collection for robot policies through imitation learning is costly and resource-intensive, limiting scalability and accessibility.

Method: A gamified platform, RoboCade, with features like visual feedback, sound effects, goal visualizations, leaderboards, and badges, is developed to encourage broader user participation in robot data collection.

Result: Gamified data collection improves robot policy success rates on target tasks by 16-56% and enhances user enjoyment by 24%, as evidenced through a user study.

Conclusion: Gamification offers an effective, scalable, and accessible approach to gather high-quality demonstration data for autonomous robot training.

Abstract: Imitation learning from human demonstrations has become a dominant approach for training autonomous robot policies. However, collecting demonstration datasets is costly: it often requires access to robots and needs sustained effort in a tedious, long process. These factors limit the scale of data available for training policies. We aim to address this scalability challenge by involving a broader audience in a gamified data collection experience that is both accessible and motivating. Specifically, we develop a gamified remote teleoperation platform, RoboCade, to engage general users in collecting data that is beneficial for downstream policy training. To do this, we embed gamification strategies into the design of the system interface and data collection tasks. In the system interface, we include components such as visual feedback, sound effects, goal visualizations, progress bars, leaderboards, and badges. We additionally propose principles for constructing gamified tasks that have overlapping structure with useful downstream target tasks. We instantiate RoboCade on three manipulation tasks -- including spatial arrangement, scanning, and insertion. To illustrate the viability of gamified robot data collection, we collect a demonstration dataset through our platform, and show that co-training robot policies with this data can improve success rate on non-gamified target tasks (+16-56%). Further, we conduct a user study to validate that novice users find the gamified platform significantly more enjoyable than a standard non-gamified platform (+24%). These results highlight the promise of gamified data collection as a scalable, accessible, and engaging method for collecting demonstration data.

*Anatoly O. Onishchenko,Alexey K. Kovalev,Aleksandr I. Panov*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents LookPlanGraph, a method creating dynamic scene graphs for robot task planning, outperforming static graph-based methods in testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods using static scene graphs for robotic task planning fail to handle environmental changes dynamically.

Method: LookPlanGraph utilizes egocentric views processed by Vision Language Models to continuously update scene graphs during task execution.

Result: LookPlanGraph outperformed static scene graph methods in VirtualHome and OmniGibson simulations and proved effective in real-world tests.

Conclusion: Dynamic updates to scene graphs make LookPlanGraph a robust solution for adapting to environmental changes in robot task planning.

Abstract: Methods that use Large Language Models (LLM) as planners for embodied instruction following tasks have become widespread. To successfully complete tasks, the LLM must be grounded in the environment in which the robot operates. One solution is to use a scene graph that contains all the necessary information. Modern methods rely on prebuilt scene graphs and assume that all task-relevant information is available at the start of planning. However, these approaches do not account for changes in the environment that may occur between the graph construction and the task execution. We propose LookPlanGraph - a method that leverages a scene graph composed of static assets and object priors. During plan execution, LookPlanGraph continuously updates the graph with relevant objects, either by verifying existing priors or discovering new entities. This is achieved by processing the agents egocentric camera view using a Vision Language Model. We conducted experiments with changed object positions VirtualHome and OmniGibson simulated environments, demonstrating that LookPlanGraph outperforms methods based on predefined static scene graphs. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach, we also conducted experiments in a real-world setting. Additionally, we introduce the GraSIF (Graph Scenes for Instruction Following) dataset with automated validation framework, comprising 514 tasks drawn from SayPlan Office, BEHAVIOR-1K, and VirtualHome RobotHow.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional control interfaces for quadruped robots are complex and require technical expertise. This paper aims to simplify robot operation by enabling intuitive natural language-based controls.

Method: The authors developed a distributed control architecture where high-level processing is offloaded to an external server and integrated LLMs to convert natural language instructions into ROS commands using sensor fusion.

Result: The system was tested in structured indoor settings across four scenarios, achieving over 90% success rate for navigation tasks.

Conclusion: The results validate the feasibility of using LLM-based offloaded planning for real-world quadruped robotics, enabling more accessible and robust operation.

Abstract: Traditional control interfaces for quadruped robots often impose a high barrier to entry, requiring specialized technical knowledge for effective operation. To address this, this paper presents a novel control framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable intuitive, natural language-based navigation. We propose a distributed architecture where high-level instruction processing is offloaded to an external server to overcome the onboard computational constraints of the DeepRobotics Jueying Lite 3 platform. The system grounds LLM-generated plans into executable ROS navigation commands using real-time sensor fusion (LiDAR, IMU, and Odometry). Experimental validation was conducted in a structured indoor environment across four distinct scenarios, ranging from single-room tasks to complex cross-zone navigation. The results demonstrate the system's robustness, achieving an aggregate success rate of over 90\% across all scenarios, validating the feasibility of offloaded LLM-based planning for autonomous quadruped deployment in real-world settings.

*Jingyang You,Hanna Kurniawati,Lashika Medagoda*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Efficient inspection planning is achieved using neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), reducing memory usage significantly while maintaining trajectory quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in inspecting large and complex infrastructures efficiently amidst high memory requirements of conventional methods.

Method: Development of Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM) for sampling-based planners using neural SDFs entirely during planning.

Result: Evaluation demonstrates inspection trajectory quality similar to state-of-the-art methods, while using up to 70x less memory.

Conclusion: IPIM enables memory-efficient inspection planning using implicit models without compromising planning quality, making it suitable for large complex structures.

Abstract: The aging and increasing complexity of infrastructures make efficient inspection planning more critical in ensuring safety. Thanks to sampling-based motion planning, many inspection planners are fast. However, they often require huge memory. This is particularly true when the structure under inspection is large and complex, consisting of many struts and pillars of various geometry and sizes. Such structures can be represented efficiently using implicit models, such as neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs). However, most primitive computations used in sampling-based inspection planner have been designed to work efficiently with explicit environment models, which in turn requires the planner to use explicit environment models or performs frequent transformations between implicit and explicit environment models during planning. This paper proposes a set of primitive computations, called Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM), that enable sampling-based inspection planners to entirely use neural SDFs representation during planning. Evaluation on three scenarios, including inspection of a complex real-world structure with over 92M triangular mesh faces, indicates that even a rudimentary sampling-based planner with IPIM can generate inspection trajectories of similar quality to those generated by the state-of-the-art planner, while using up to 70x less memory than the state-of-the-art inspection planner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the decreasing awareness of the multifaceted aspects of process analysis, particularly human and organizational factors, amidst the growing technical focus in data-driven process mining.

Method: The authors use an inductive and deductive approach to conceptualize 'process analytics' and validate it against a real-life case study from a large company.

Result: A new perspective on the socio-technical aspects of data-driven process analysis is introduced, alongside a framework for process analytics that incorporates organizational and stakeholder dimensions.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need to balance technical, human, and organizational considerations in process analysis and presents a conceptual framework for enhancing such analyses.

Abstract: Data-driven analysis of business processes has a long tradition in research. However, recently the term of process mining is mostly used when referring to data-driven process analysis. As a consequence, awareness for the many facets of process analysis is decreasing. In particular, while an increasing focus is put onto technical aspects of the analysis, human and organisational concerns remain under the radar. Following the socio-technical perspective of information systems research, we propose a new perspective onto data-driven process analysis that combines the process of analysis with the organisation and its stakeholders. This paper conceptualises the term process analytics and its various dimensions by following both an inductive and deductive approach. The results are discussed by contrasting them to a real-life case study from a large company implementing data-driven process analysis and automation.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RepoNavigator is a novel LLM-based tool for effective file and function modification detection in OSS repositories, achieving state-of-the-art results with reinforcement learning (RL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying code requiring changes in large and complex open-source software repositories is difficult. Existing methods are inefficient and rely heavily on multiple tools, ignoring code execution flow and increasing complexity.

Method: RepoNavigator uses an execution-aware tool for jumping to invoked symbol definitions, reflecting actual code flow. It is trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning directly from a pretrained model, skipping closed-source distillation.

Result: RepoNavigator demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across various model scales (7B, 14B, 32B), surpassing larger and even closed-source alternatives like Claude-3.7.

Conclusion: The combination of a single, execution-aware tool and RL training makes RepoNavigator a scalable and efficient solution for navigating OSS repositories, improving repository-level issue localization.

Abstract: Locating the files and functions requiring modification in large open-source software (OSS) repositories is challenging due to their scale and structural complexity. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods typically treat this as a repository-level retrieval task and rely on multiple auxiliary tools, which overlook code execution logic and complicate model control. We propose RepoNavigator, an LLM agent equipped with a single execution-aware tool-jumping to the definition of an invoked symbol. This unified design reflects the actual flow of code execution while simplifying tool manipulation. RepoNavigator is trained end-to-end via Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly from a pretrained model, without any closed-source distillation. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained RepoNavigator achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 7B model outperforming 14B baselines, the 14B model surpassing 32B competitors, and even the 32B model exceeding closed-source models such as Claude-3.7. These results confirm that integrating a single, structurally grounded tool with RL training provides an efficient and scalable solution for repository-level issue localization.

TL;DR: The paper studies how Large Language Models adapt their code generation strategies when exposed to test cases, analyzing the impact of test visibility and restrictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how tensions between pretraining objectives and alignment choices impact LLMs in automated code generation.

Method: Five LLMs were evaluated under five varying prompting conditions manipulating test visibility and restrictions using metrics such as correctness, code similarity, program size, and code churn.

Result: Results show test visibility significantly alters performance, with correctness nearly doubling, despite restrictions. Four adaptation strategies were identified, with test-driven refinement being most common.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate how contextual signals influence LLM behavior, revealing insights into how pretraining objectives balance with alignment constraints.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation, yet their apparent successes often mask a tension between pretraining objectives and alignment choices. While pretraining encourages models to exploit all available signals to maximize success, alignment, whether through fine-tuning or prompting, may restrict their use. This conflict is especially salient in agentic AI settings, for instance when an agent has access to unit tests that, although intended for validation, act as strong contextual signals that can be leveraged regardless of explicit prohibitions. In this paper, we investigate how LLMs adapt their code generation strategies when exposed to test cases under different prompting conditions. Using the BigCodeBench (Hard) dataset, we design five prompting conditions that manipulate test visibility and impose explicit or implicit restrictions on their use. We evaluate five LLMs (four open-source and one closed-source) across correctness, code similarity, program size, and code churn, and analyze cross-model consistency to identify recurring adaptation strategies. Our results show that test visibility dramatically alters performance, correctness nearly doubles for some models, while explicit restrictions or partial exposure only partially mitigate this effect. Beyond raw performance, we identify four recurring adaptation strategies, with test-driven refinement emerging as the most frequent. These results highlight how LLMs adapt their behavior when exposed to contextual signals that conflict with explicit instructions, providing useful insight into how models reconcile pretraining objectives with alignment constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the unclear software security expertise of LLMs, which are increasingly being utilized for software development purposes.

Method: Five LLMs were tested across six cognitive dimensions using diverse datasets such as multiple-choice questions, vulnerable code snippets, course assessments, real-world case studies, and project-based tasks.

Result: The models excel in recalling facts and identifying known vulnerabilities but struggle with reasoning, architectural evaluation, and creating secure systems. A security knowledge boundary and 51 recurring misconception patterns were also identified.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate competence in basic security tasks but lack reliability in handling complex, higher-level software security challenges, emphasizing the need for improved LLM design for secure software engineering.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software development, but their level of software security expertise remains unclear. This work systematically evaluates the security comprehension of five leading LLMs: GPT-4o-Mini, GPT-5-Mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.1, and Qwen-2.5, using Blooms Taxonomy as a framework. We assess six cognitive dimensions: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. Our methodology integrates diverse datasets, including curated multiple-choice questions, vulnerable code snippets (SALLM), course assessments from an Introduction to Software Security course, real-world case studies (XBOW), and project-based creation tasks from a Secure Software Engineering course. Results show that while LLMs perform well on lower-level cognitive tasks such as recalling facts and identifying known vulnerabilities, their performance degrades significantly on higher-order tasks that require reasoning, architectural evaluation, and secure system creation. Beyond reporting aggregate accuracy, we introduce a software security knowledge boundary that identifies the highest cognitive level at which a model consistently maintains reliable performance. In addition, we identify 51 recurring misconception patterns exhibited by LLMs across Blooms levels.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the brain uses predictive inference in language comprehension, especially in Deaf signers exposed to visual language stimuli.

Method: They used EEG to capture brain responses, combined with optical flow-derived motion features. Spatiotemporal and frequency-specific neural signatures were extracted using coherence analysis and entropy-based feature selection.

Result: Distributed left-hemispheric and frontal low-frequency coherence were identified as key patterns in neural dynamics for language comprehension, showing experience-dependent signatures correlated with age.

Conclusion: The study introduces a new multimodal framework for studying brain-based perception and reveals distinct neural dynamics associated with visual language processing.

Abstract: Human language processing relies on the brain's capacity for predictive inference. We present a machine learning framework for decoding neural (EEG) responses to dynamic visual language stimuli in Deaf signers. Using coherence between neural signals and optical flow-derived motion features, we construct spatiotemporal representations of predictive neural dynamics. Through entropy-based feature selection, we identify frequency-specific neural signatures that differentiate interpretable linguistic input from linguistically disrupted (time-reversed) stimuli. Our results reveal distributed left-hemispheric and frontal low-frequency coherence as key features in language comprehension, with experience-dependent neural signatures correlating with age. This work demonstrates a novel multimodal approach for probing experience-driven generative models of perception in the brain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a principled approach for structure learning under generative models for better understanding and prediction.

Method: Uses Bayesian Model Reduction to quickly evaluate posteriors and selects actions based on expected free energy to maximize information gain.

Result: Demonstrates the approach with a 'three-ball' paradigm showcasing efficient resolution of uncertainty in model structures.

Conclusion: Active selection of outcomes can enhance understanding of world models and provide insights into model structure efficiently.

Abstract: This technical note considers the sampling of outcomes that provide the greatest amount of information about the structure of underlying world models. This generalisation furnishes a principled approach to structure learning under a plausible set of generative models or hypotheses. In active inference, policies - i.e., combinations of actions - are selected based on their expected free energy, which comprises expected information gain and value. Information gain corresponds to the KL divergence between predictive posteriors with, and without, the consequences of action. Posteriors over models can be evaluated quickly and efficiently using Bayesian Model Reduction, based upon accumulated posterior beliefs about model parameters. The ensuing information gain can then be used to select actions that disambiguate among alternative models, in the spirit of optimal experimental design. We illustrate this kind of active selection or reasoning using partially observed discrete models; namely, a 'three-ball' paradigm used previously to describe artificial insight and 'aha moments' via (synthetic) introspection or sleep. We focus on the sample efficiency afforded by seeking outcomes that resolve the greatest uncertainty about the world model, under which outcomes are generated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing LAD line fitting approaches regarding computational efficiency, implementation complexity, and lack of maintained public tools.

Method: Proposes the PALB method, which uses piecewise-affine lower bounds derived from subgradients and a subdivision scheme to ensure correctness and efficient computation.

Result: PALB exhibits log-linear scaling on synthetic and real datasets, outperforming existing publicly available LP and IRLS-based solvers.

Conclusion: PALB offers an exact, efficient, and robust solution to LAD line fitting, filling a practical gap with a publicly available, well-maintained implementation.

Abstract: Least-absolute-deviations (LAD) line fitting is robust to outliers but computationally more involved than least squares regression. Although the literature includes linear and near-linear time algorithms for the LAD line fitting problem, these methods are difficult to implement and, to our knowledge, lack maintained public implementations. As a result, practitioners often resort to linear programming (LP) based methods such as the simplex-based Barrodale-Roberts method and interior-point methods, or on iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approximation which does not guarantee exact solutions. To close this gap, we propose the Piecewise Affine Lower-Bounding (PALB) method, an exact algorithm for LAD line fitting. PALB uses supporting lines derived from subgradients to build piecewise-affine lower bounds, and employs a subdivision scheme involving minima of these lower bounds. We prove correctness and provide bounds on the number of iterations. On synthetic datasets with varied signal types and noise including heavy-tailed outliers as well as a real dataset from the NOAA's Integrated Surface Database, PALB exhibits empirical log-linear scaling. It is consistently faster than publicly available implementations of LP based and IRLS based solvers. We provide a reference implementation written in Rust with a Python API.

Result: The paper provides insights into the design choices for diffusion models in SBI, backed by case studies across various contexts.

Conclusion: Diffusion models are versatile for SBI, with emerging techniques and open questions shaping their future development.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful learners for simulation-based inference (SBI), enabling fast and accurate estimation of latent parameters from simulated and real data.

We highlight opportunities created by various concepts such as guidance, score composition, flow matching, consistency models, and joint modeling. Furthermore, we discuss how efficiency and statistical accuracy are affected by noise schedules, parameterizations, and samplers. Finally, we illustrate these concepts with case studies across parameter dimensionalities, simulation budgets, and model types, and outline open questions for future research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces weighted evaluation measures for classification tasks to account for varying importance of observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation measures for classification tasks fail to account for instances of varying importance.

Method: A weighted Pearson-Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) for binary and multiclass classification was proposed and analyzed.

Result: The weighted measures are robust to small changes in the chosen weights and help differentiate classifiers based on performance on higher weighted observations.

Conclusion: Weighted measures prove more insightful compared to unweighted ones, capturing the significance of individual observation weights effectively.

Abstract: Several performance measures are used to evaluate binary and multiclass classification tasks.
  But individual observations may often have distinct weights, and none of these measures are sensitive to such varying weights.
  We propose a new weighted Pearson-Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) for binary classification as well as weighted versions of related multiclass measures. The weighted MCC varies between $-1$ and $1$. But crucially, the weighted MCC values are higher for classifiers that perform better on highly weighted observations, and hence is able to distinguish them from classifiers that have a similar overall performance and ones that perform better on the lowly weighted observations.
  Furthermore, we prove that the weighted measures are robust with respect to the choice of weights in a precise manner:
  if the weights are changed by at most $ε$, the value of the weighted measure changes at most by a factor of $ε$ in the binary case
  and by a factor of $ε^2$ in the multiclass case.
  Our computations demonstrate that the weighted measures clearly identify classifiers that perform better on higher weighted observations, while the unweighted measures remain completely indifferent to the choices of weights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the issue of sparse count data in fields like infectious disease prediction, where traditional methods face challenges with regions reporting zero cases.

Method: The PHIBP framework systematically borrows statistical strength across regions and addresses sensitivity issues of relative-rate methods using the concept of absolute abundance.

Result: Experiments with infectious disease data showed that PHIBP produces accurate outbreak predictions and supports comparative ecological measures, like alpha and beta diversity.

Conclusion: PHIBP is an effective and robust framework for predictive modeling in data-sparse contexts, offering epidemiological insights and reliable predictions.

Abstract: Modeling sparse count data, which arise across numerous scientific fields, presents significant statistical challenges. This chapter addresses these challenges in the context of infectious disease prediction, with a focus on predicting outbreaks in geographic regions that have historically reported zero cases. To this end, we present the detailed computational framework and experimental application of the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP), with demonstrated success in handling sparse count data in microbiome and ecological studies. The PHIBP's architecture, grounded in the concept of absolute abundance, systematically borrows statistical strength from related regions and circumvents the known sensitivities of relative-rate methods to zero counts. Through a series of experiments on infectious disease data, we show that this principled approach provides a robust foundation for generating coherent predictive distributions and for the effective use of comparative measures such as alpha and beta diversity. The chapter's emphasis on algorithmic implementation and experimental results confirms that this unified framework delivers both accurate outbreak predictions and meaningful epidemiological insights in data-sparse settings.

TL;DR: The paper addresses slow sampling in diffusion models and proposes Gaussianization preprocessing to improve early-stage reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the sampling inefficiency in diffusion models caused by delayed trajectory bifurcation, impacting reconstruction and generation quality.

Method: They propose preprocessing training data using Gaussianization to make the target distribution resemble an independent Gaussian distribution, aiding the model in simplified learning.

Result: Applying Gaussianization preprocessing enhances reconstruction quality in small-scale network architectures and fosters efficient sampling.

Conclusion: The method improves generation quality in diffusion models and is broadly applicable to generative tasks for more stable and efficient sampling.

Abstract: Diffusion models are a class of generative models that have demonstrated remarkable success in tasks such as image generation. However, one of the bottlenecks of these models is slow sampling due to the delay before the onset of trajectory bifurcation, at which point substantial reconstruction begins. This issue degrades generation quality, especially in the early stages. Our primary objective is to mitigate bifurcation-related issues by preprocessing the training data to enhance reconstruction quality, particularly for small-scale network architectures. Specifically, we propose applying Gaussianization preprocessing to the training data to make the target distribution more closely resemble an independent Gaussian distribution, which serves as the initial density of the reconstruction process. This preprocessing step simplifies the model's task of learning the target distribution, thereby improving generation quality even in the early stages of reconstruction with small networks. The proposed method is, in principle, applicable to a broad range of generative tasks, enabling more stable and efficient sampling processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of marketing attribution amidst increasing privacy restrictions and decreasing accessibility to user-level path data.

Method: The paper presents a Causal-Driven Attribution (CDA) framework that combines temporal causal discovery (PCMCI) and causal effect estimation (Structural Causal Model) to analyze aggregated impression-level data.

Result: The CDA framework achieves an average relative RMSE of 9.50% with the true causal graph and 24.23% with a predicted graph, showcasing robust accuracy and meaningful signal recovery even under structural uncertainty.

Conclusion: CDA provides a privacy-preserving, scalable, and interpretable solution for marketing attribution that avoids reliance on traditional user-level tracking methods.

Abstract: Attribution modelling lies at the heart of marketing effectiveness, yet most existing approaches depend on user-level path data, which are increasingly inaccessible due to privacy regulations and platform restrictions. This paper introduces a Causal-Driven Attribution (CDA) framework that infers channel influence using only aggregated impression-level data, avoiding any reliance on user identifiers or click-path tracking. CDA integrates temporal causal discovery (using PCMCI) with causal effect estimation via a Structural Causal Model to recover directional channel relationships and quantify their contributions to conversions. Using large-scale synthetic data designed to replicate real marketing dynamics, we show that CDA achieves an average relative RMSE of 9.50% when given the true causal graph, and 24.23% when using the predicted graph, demonstrating strong accuracy under correct structure and meaningful signal recovery even under structural uncertainty. CDA captures cross-channel interdependencies while providing interpretable, privacy-preserving attribution insights, offering a scalable and future-proof alternative to traditional path-based models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in machine learning models under overparametrization, particularly understanding degenerate optimization problems and their effects on solutions.

Method: Relating degenerate optimization to nondegenerate problems using projection, employing the ramification locus as a key tool, and extending algebraic geometry methodologies to the degenerate scenario.

Result: Frameworks and tools were developed to count critical points over projective varieties; specific cases in deep learning were explored within the proposed mathematical approach.

Conclusion: The study bridges algebraic geometry with machine learning, extending knowledge on the Euclidean distance degree to degenerate optimization cases and offering insights into overparametrized settings.

Abstract: We study the critical points over an algebraic variety of an optimization problem defined by a quadratic objective that is degenerate. This scenario arises in machine learning when the dataset size is small with respect to the model, and is typically referred to as overparametrization. Our main result relates the degenerate optimization problem to a nondegenerate one via a projection. In the highly-degenerate regime, we find that a central role is played by the ramification locus of the projection. Additionally, we provide tools for counting the number of critical points over projective varieties, and discuss specific cases arising from deep learning. Our work bridges tools from algebraic geometry with ideas from machine learning, and it extends the line of literature around the Euclidean distance degree to the degenerate setting.

### [233] [Cooperation Through Indirect Reciprocity in Child-Robot Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20621)
*Isabel Neto,Alexandre S. Pires,Filipa Correia,Fernando P. Santos*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study examines whether indirect reciprocity (IR) can be applied in human-AI interactions, particularly with children and robots, and its implications for cooperative behaviors using learning algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As artificial agents increasingly become a part of social interactions, understanding trust and cooperation is essential for effective human-AI teamwork. Inspired by IR mechanisms in human interactions, the study assesses its potential in human-AI relationships, especially considering demographic and learning challenges.

Method: The research combines lab experiments and theoretical modeling to explore IR in children-robot interactions, examine robot learning capabilities using child strategies, and analyze the impact of different learning algorithms on human-AI cooperation.

Result: IR mechanisms successfully translate to children and robots in coordination tasks. Multi-armed bandit algorithms can learn cooperative behavior based on children's strategies, though the effectiveness of learning depends on human-revealed strategies.

Conclusion: Indirect reciprocity is applicable to human-AI collaborations, especially with children and robots. However, the success of cooperation depends on the quality of human strategies and the learning algorithms employed.

Abstract: Social interactions increasingly involve artificial agents, such as conversational or collaborative bots. Understanding trust and prosociality in these settings is fundamental to improve human-AI teamwork. Research in biology and social sciences has identified mechanisms to sustain cooperation among humans. Indirect reciprocity (IR) is one of them. With IR, helping someone can enhance an individual's reputation, nudging others to reciprocate in the future. Transposing IR to human-AI interactions is however challenging, as differences in human demographics, moral judgements, and agents' learning dynamics can affect how interactions are assessed. To study IR in human-AI groups, we combine laboratory experiments and theoretical modelling. We investigate whether 1) indirect reciprocity can be transposed to children-robot interactions; 2) artificial agents can learn to cooperate given children's strategies; and 3) how differences in learning algorithms impact human-AI cooperation. We find that IR extends to children and robots solving coordination dilemmas. Furthermore, we observe that the strategies revealed by children provide a sufficient signal for multi-armed bandit algorithms to learn cooperative actions. Beyond the experimental scenarios, we observe that cooperating through multi-armed bandit algorithms is highly dependent on the strategies revealed by humans.

### [234] [Uncovering Patterns of Brain Activity from EEG Data Consistently Associated with Cybersickness Using Neural Network Interpretability Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20620)
*Jacqueline Yau,Katherine J. Mimnaugh,Evan G. Center,Timo Ojala,Steven M. LaValle,Wenzhen Yuan,Nancy Amato,Minje Kim,Kara Federmeier*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel approach using EEG data and neural networks to improve cybersickness detection during VR use, focusing on brain patterns beyond visual stimulus processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cybersickness in VR is a significant hurdle. Current EEG methods do not adequately account for the confounding effects of visual stimuli on brain activity during sickness detection.

Method: The authors leveraged ERPs triggered by auditory stimuli, combined with convolutional neural networks and transformer models, to identify key EEG features linked to cybersickness. Interpretability maps were used for visualizing classification insights.

Result: The study highlighted the importance of EEG signatures near the left prefrontal cortex for classifying cybersickness. This discovery was consistent across several trials using different neural networks.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that the left prefrontal cortex scalp location could serve as a targeted marker for enhanced real-time cybersickness classification in VR environments.

Abstract: Cybersickness poses a serious challenge for users of virtual reality (VR) technology. Consequently, there has been significant effort to track its occurrence during VR use with brain activity through electroencephalography (EEG). However, a significant confound in current methods for detecting sickness from EEG is they do not account for the simultaneous processing of the sickening visual stimulus that is present in the brain data from VR. Using event-related potentials (ERPs) from an auditory stimulus shown to reflect cybersickness impacts, we can more precisely target EEG cybersickness features and use those to achieve better performance in online cybersickness classification. In this article, we introduce a method utilizing trained convolutional neural networks and transformer models and plot interpretability maps from integrated gradients and class activation to give a visual representation of what the model determined was most useful in sickness classification from an EEG dataset consisting of ERPs recorded during the elicitation of cybersickness. Across 12 runs of our method with three different neural networks, the models consistently pointed to a surprising finding: that amplitudes recorded at an electrode placed on the scalp near the left prefrontal cortex were important in the classification of cybersickness. These results help clarify a hidden pattern in other related research and point to exciting opportunities for future investigation: that this scalp location could be used as a tagged feature for better real-time cybersickness classification with EEG.

*Gaia Ebli,Bianca Raimondi,Maurizio Gabbrielli*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study examines the interrelations of key learning factors in AI-augmented educational environments, revealing distinct perceptions between middle and high school students.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in understanding of how key learning factors interrelate in AI-mediated education and vary across age groups.

Method: Study conducted in classrooms using AI tools for programming activities; data analyzed via correlation analysis and text mining.

Result: Middle school students exhibit holistic positive perception interrelations, while high school students show differentiated, independent evaluations.

Conclusion: Findings highlight developmental stage impacts on learning perceptions, guiding tailored AI integration strategies for education.

Abstract: The increasing integration of AI tools in education has led prior research to explore their impact on learning processes. Nevertheless, most existing studies focus on higher education and conventional instructional contexts, leaving open questions about how key learning factors are related in AI-mediated learning environments and how these relationships may vary across different age groups. Addressing these gaps, our work investigates whether four critical learning factors, experience, clarity, comfort, and motivation, maintain coherent interrelationships in AI-augmented educational settings, and how the structure of these relationships differs between middle and high school students. The study was conducted in authentic classroom contexts where students interacted with AI tools as part of programming learning activities to collect data on the four learning factors and students' perceptions. Using a multimethod quantitative analysis, which combined correlation analysis and text mining, we revealed markedly different dimensional structures between the two age groups. Middle school students exhibit strong positive correlations across all dimensions, indicating holistic evaluation patterns whereby positive perceptions in one dimension generalise to others. In contrast, high school students show weak or near-zero correlations between key dimensions, suggesting a more differentiated evaluation process in which dimensions are assessed independently. These findings reveal that perception dimensions actively mediate AI-augmented learning and that the developmental stage moderates their interdependencies. This work establishes a foundation for the development of AI integration strategies that respond to learners' developmental levels and account for age-specific dimensional structures in student-AI interactions.

### [236] [Graph Neural Networks for Source Detection: A Review and Benchmark Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20657)
*Martin Sterchi,Nathan Brack,Lorenz Hilfiker*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper investigates the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for the epidemic source detection problem, concluding that GNNs outperform traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to clarify whether GNNs genuinely excel over traditional source detection methods, addressing issues of methodology clarity and reproducibility in prior research.

Method: The approach includes reviewing existing GNN-based methods, proposing a new GNN architecture tailored for source detection, and conducting systematic experiments across varied network types.

Result: Experimental results show that GNNs significantly outperform traditional methods across different network settings.

Conclusion: GNNs are highly effective for the epidemic source detection problem and should be considered a benchmark task for evaluating GNN architectures.

Abstract: The source detection problem arises when an epidemic process unfolds over a contact network, and the objective is to identify its point of origin, i.e., the source node. Research on this problem began with the seminal work of Shah and Zaman in 2010, who formally defined it and introduced the notion of rumor centrality. With the emergence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), several studies have proposed GNN-based approaches to source detection. However, some of these works lack methodological clarity and/or are hard to reproduce. As a result, it remains unclear (to us, at least) whether GNNs truly outperform more traditional source detection methods across comparable settings. In this paper, we first review existing GNN-based methods for source detection, clearly outlining the specific settings each addresses and the models they employ. Building on this research, we propose a principled GNN architecture tailored to the source detection task. We also systematically investigate key questions surrounding this problem. Most importantly, we aim to provide a definitive assessment of how GNNs perform relative to other source detection methods. Our experiments show that GNNs substantially outperform all other methods we test across a variety of network types. Although we initially set out to challenge the notion of GNNs as a solution to source detection, our results instead demonstrate their remarkable effectiveness for this task. We discuss possible reasons for this strong performance. To ensure full reproducibility, we release all code and data on GitHub. Finally, we argue that epidemic source detection should serve as a benchmark task for evaluating GNN architectures.

### [237] [A Community-Enhanced Graph Representation Model for Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21166)
*Lei Wang,Darong Lai*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: Traditional GNNs for link prediction struggle due to their focus on local representations. CELP introduces community-aware methods to improve predictions and performs better in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the shortcomings of traditional GNNs in performing link prediction by incorporating community structures.

Method: Proposes a Community-Enhanced Link Prediction framework (CELP) that integrates community-aware edge adjustments and multi-scale structural features.

Result: Experiments across benchmark datasets show improved link prediction accuracy through CELP.

Conclusion: Community structures play a crucial role in enhancing link prediction in graphs, as validated by the CELP framework.

Abstract: Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for graph representation learning, their performance on link prediction tasks does not always surpass that of traditional heuristic methods such as Common Neighbors and Jaccard Coefficient. This is mainly because existing GNNs tend to focus on learning local node representations, making it difficult to effectively capture structural relationships between node pairs. Furthermore, excessive reliance on local neighborhood information can lead to over-smoothing. Prior studies have shown that introducing global structural encoding can partially alleviate this issue. To address these limitations, we propose a Community-Enhanced Link Prediction (CELP) framework that incorporates community structure to jointly model local and global graph topology. Specifically, CELP enhances the graph via community-aware, confidence-guided edge completion and pruning, while integrating multi-scale structural features to achieve more accurate link prediction. Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CELP achieves superior performance, validating the crucial role of community structure in improving link prediction accuracy.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenTSE, a two-stage generative model for improving text-to-speech synthesis, offering better speech quality and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance generalization, speech fidelity, and alignment in speech synthesis using language model-based generative approaches.

Method: A two-stage decoder-only language model: Stage-1 generates semantic tokens, and Stage-2 generates fine acoustic tokens. Optimization uses Frozen-LM Conditioning and DPO methods.

Result: Experiments on Libri2Mix dataset demonstrate that GenTSE outperforms previous LM-based methods in speech quality, intelligibility, and speaker consistency.

Conclusion: Separating semantic and acoustic token generation improves decoding stability and aligns outputs closely with human perceptual preferences, advancing speech synthesis systems.

Abstract: Language Model (LM)-based generative modeling has emerged as a promising direction for TSE, offering potential for improved generalization and high-fidelity speech. We present GenTSE, a two-stage decoder-only generative LM approach for TSE: Stage-1 predicts coarse semantic tokens, and Stage-2 generates fine acoustic tokens. Separating semantics and acoustics stabilizes decoding and yields more faithful, content-aligned target speech. Both stages use continuous SSL or codec embeddings, offering richer context than discretized-prompt methods. To reduce exposure bias, we employ a Frozen-LM Conditioning training strategy that conditions the LMs on predicted tokens from earlier checkpoints to reduce the gap between teacher-forcing training and autoregressive inference. We further employ DPO to better align outputs with human perceptual preferences. Experiments on Libri2Mix show that GenTSE surpasses previous LM-based systems in speech quality, intelligibility, and speaker consistency.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a fixed-time control scheme for underwater gliders to navigate safely and accurately in turbulent and uncertain environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater gliders face navigation risks due to strong currents, turbulence, and environmental disturbances during challenging missions such as hurricane observations and environmental monitoring.

Method: A fixed-time prescribed performance control scheme is presented, integrating finite-time performance functions within a fixed-time control framework, with a disturbance observer for enhanced robustness.

Result: The method ensures precise waypoint navigation, better handling of disturbances, and improved tracking accuracy as demonstrated by numerical simulations compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the navigation safety and accuracy of underwater gliders, making it suitable for robust performance in turbulent underwater environments.

Abstract: Underwater gliders are increasingly deployed in challenging missions - such as hurricane-season observations and long-endurance environmental monitoring - where strong currents and turbulence pose significant risks to navigation safety. To address these practical challenges, this paper presents a fixed-time prescribed performance control scheme for the 3D path following of underwater gliders subject to model uncertainties and environmental disturbances. The primary contribution is the integration of a finite-time performance function within a fixed-time control framework. This synthesis ensures that the tracking errors are constrained within prescribed performance bounds and converge to a compact set within a fixed time, independent of initial conditions. A second key contribution is the development of a fixed-time sliding mode disturbance observer that provides accurate finite-time estimation of lumped disturbances, enhancing the system's robustness. Integrated with an iLOS guidance law, the proposed controller enables precise and safe waypoint following. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional sliding mode and prescribed performance controllers in tracking accuracy, convergence speed, and control effort smoothness, validating its efficacy for robust underwater navigation.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework combining SINDy for system modeling and TD3 reinforcement learning to efficiently and robustly control nonlinear dynamic systems, achieving superior results compared to conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency and limited robustness of traditional model-free reinforcement learning methods when controlling systems with complex nonlinear dynamics.

Method: The framework integrates Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to model system dynamics and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) reinforcement learning. Synthetic rollouts from the SINDy-derived model are injected into the replay buffer during training, improving sample efficiency.

Result: The approach is tested on a bi-rotor system for stabilization and trajectory tracking, showing superior accuracy and robustness compared to direct reinforcement learning techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed SINDy-TD3 framework effectively combines data-driven modeling and reinforcement learning, offering a promising solution for controlling complex nonlinear systems with improved efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: Controlling systems with complex, nonlinear dynamics poses a significant challenge, particularly in achieving efficient and robust control. In this paper, we propose a Dyna-Style Reinforcement Learning control framework that integrates Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) with Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) reinforcement learning. SINDy is used to identify a data-driven model of the system, capturing its key dynamics without requiring an explicit physical model. This identified model is used to generate synthetic rollouts that are periodically injected into the reinforcement learning replay buffer during training on the real environment, enabling efficient policy learning with limited data available. By leveraging this hybrid approach, we mitigate the sample inefficiency of traditional model-free reinforcement learning methods while ensuring accurate control of nonlinear systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to a bi-rotor system as a case study, evaluating its performance in stabilization and trajectory tracking. The results show that our SINDy-TD3 approach achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to direct reinforcement learning techniques, highlighting the potential of combining data-driven modeling with reinforcement learning for complex dynamical systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReaSeq, a reasoning-based framework leveraging Large Language Models to improve limitations in industrial recommender systems, showing significant performance improvements on Taobao.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations in current recommender systems, such as lack of semantic depth in item representations and failure to consider user interests outside platform interaction logs.

Method: The ReaSeq framework uses explicit reasoning (Chain-of-Thought via multi-agent collaboration) and latent reasoning (via Diffusion Large Language Models) to enhance item representations and infer potential user behaviors.

Result: ReaSeq demonstrated more than 6.0% improvements in IPV and CTR, over 2.9% increase in Orders, and more than 2.5% rise in GMV when deployed on Taobao’s ranking system.

Conclusion: The study validates that reasoning via Large Language Models and using world knowledge can significantly outperform traditional log-driven approaches in recommender systems.

Abstract: Industrial recommender systems face two fundamental limitations under the log-driven paradigm: (1) knowledge poverty in ID-based item representations that causes brittle interest modeling under data sparsity, and (2) systemic blindness to beyond-log user interests that constrains model performance within platform boundaries. These limitations stem from an over-reliance on shallow interaction statistics and close-looped feedback while neglecting the rich world knowledge about product semantics and cross-domain behavioral patterns that Large Language Models have learned from vast corpora.
  To address these challenges, we introduce ReaSeq, a reasoning-enhanced framework that leverages world knowledge in Large Language Models to address both limitations through explicit and implicit reasoning. Specifically, ReaSeq employs explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning via multi-agent collaboration to distill structured product knowledge into semantically enriched item representations, and latent reasoning via Diffusion Large Language Models to infer plausible beyond-log behaviors. Deployed on Taobao's ranking system serving hundreds of millions of users, ReaSeq achieves substantial gains: >6.0% in IPV and CTR, >2.9% in Orders, and >2.5% in GMV, validating the effectiveness of world-knowledge-enhanced reasoning over purely log-driven approaches.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a domain-aware Japanese text-embedding approach tailored for enhancing search capabilities on Mercari, Japan's largest consumer-to-consumer (C2C) marketplace. It demonstrates improvements in search relevance and efficiency with practical implementation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: C2C marketplaces face retrieval challenges such as short, ambiguous queries, and noisy user-generated listings. Improving the quality of search in these marketplaces is critical for user satisfaction and platform performance.

Method: The authors utilized domain-aware fine-tuning on query-title pairs with role-specific prefixes and applied Matryoshka Representation Learning for compact embeddings that meet production constraints.

Result: The approach showed offline gains in search relevance, handling proper nouns, marketplace-specific semantics, and term importance. Online A/B testing indicated revenue and efficiency improvements without compromising transaction frequency.

Conclusion: Domain-aware embeddings enhance search relevance and efficiency at scale, making it a robust foundation for advanced search in these environments.

Abstract: Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) marketplaces pose distinct retrieval challenges: short, ambiguous queries; noisy, user-generated listings; and strict production constraints. This paper reports our experiment to build a domain-aware Japanese text-embedding approach to improve the quality of search at Mercari, Japan's largest C2C marketplace. We experimented with fine-tuning on purchase-driven query-title pairs, using role-specific prefixes to model query-item asymmetry. To meet production constraints, we apply Matryoshka Representation Learning to obtain compact, truncation-robust embeddings. Offline evaluation on historical search logs shows consistent gains over a strong generic encoder, with particularly large improvements when replacing PCA compression with Matryoshka truncation. A manual assessment further highlights better handling of proper nouns, marketplace-specific semantics, and term-importance alignment. Additionally, an initial online A/B test demonstrates statistically significant improvements in revenue per user and search-flow efficiency, with transaction frequency maintained. Results show that domain-aware embeddings improve relevance and efficiency at scale and form a practical foundation for richer LLM-era search experiences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the growing challenges posed by online misinformation and the limitations of existing detection methods in handling multimodal content, domain generalization, and providing transparency.

Method: The proposed method leverages a structured reasoning pipeline combining LLMs, reverse image search, persuasion strategy analysis, and credibility fusion mechanisms. It integrates textual, visual, and contextual data, complemented by an SLM classifier to address LLM limitations.

Result: AMPEND-LS significantly outperformed baseline models in accuracy, F1 score, and robustness across three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: AMPEND-LS marks progress in creating effective systems for combatting misinformation with improved adaptability, explainability, and evidence-grounded reasoning.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online misinformation poses significant risks to public trust, policy, and safety, necessitating reliable automated fake news detection. Existing methods often struggle with multimodal content, domain generalization, and explainability. We propose AMPEND-LS, an agentic multi-persona evidence-grounded framework with LLM-SLM synergy for multimodal fake news detection. AMPEND-LS integrates textual, visual, and contextual signals through a structured reasoning pipeline powered by LLMs, augmented with reverse image search, knowledge graph paths, and persuasion strategy analysis. To improve reliability, we introduce a credibility fusion mechanism combining semantic similarity, domain trustworthiness, and temporal context, and a complementary SLM classifier to mitigate LLM uncertainty and hallucinations. Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMPEND-LS consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy, F1 score, and robustness. Qualitative case studies further highlight its transparent reasoning and resilience against evolving misinformation. This work advances the development of adaptive, explainable, and evidence-aware systems for safeguarding online information integrity.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: HiGeMine is a framework for book genre classification that integrates cleaned user reviews and book blurbs for a robust hierarchical classification, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve accuracy in book genre classification while addressing challenges like noisy and subjective data, and leveraging hierarchical genre structures.

Method: HiGeMine uses a two-phase framework: filtering reviews semantically aligned with authoritative blurbs and a graph-based hierarchical classification architecture (binary and multi-label).

Result: HiGeMine outperformed strong baselines in hierarchical genre classification tasks using a newly curated dataset.

Conclusion: The framework effectively combines structured and unstructured textual data for a reliable and structured approach to hierarchical book genre classification.

Abstract: Accurate book genre classification is fundamental to digital library organization, content discovery, and personalized recommendation. Existing approaches typically model genre prediction as a flat, single-label task, ignoring hierarchical genre structure and relying heavily on noisy, subjective user reviews, which often degrade classification reliability. We propose HiGeMine, a two-phase hierarchical genre mining framework that robustly integrates user reviews with authoritative book blurbs. In the first phase, HiGeMine employs a zero-shot semantic alignment strategy to filter reviews, retaining only those semantically consistent with the corresponding blurb, thereby mitigating noise, bias, and irrelevance. In the second phase, we introduce a dual-path, two-level graph-based classification architecture: a coarse-grained Level-1 binary classifier distinguishes fiction from non-fiction, followed by Level-2 multi-label classifiers for fine-grained genre prediction. Inter-genre dependencies are explicitly modeled using a label co-occurrence graph, while contextual representations are derived from pretrained language models applied to the filtered textual content. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we curate a new hierarchical book genre dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HiGeMine consistently outperformed strong baselines across hierarchical genre classification tasks. The proposed framework offers a principled and effective solution for leveraging both structured and unstructured textual data in hierarchical book genre analysis.

*Yuan Qiu,Wolfgang Dahmen,Peng Chen*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper presents a variationally correct framework and Reduced Basis Neural Operator (RBNO) to enhance physical consistency and accuracy for neural operators solving partial differential equations (PDEs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the limitations of standard PDE-residual loss formulations, which lack variational correctness and result in unreliable solution errors. This hindered achieving optimal accuracy in neural operators.

Method: The authors propose a framework based on First-Order System Least-Squares (FOSLS) objectives to ensure equivalence between residual and solution errors. They further introduce the Reduced Basis Neural Operator (RBNO), which predicts coefficients for pre-computed reduced bases, ensuring variational stability and efficient training.

Result: The approach is validated on stationary diffusion and linear elasticity problems, achieving superior accuracy in PDE-compliant norms compared to standard methods. It also provides a reliable error estimator.

Conclusion: The proposed RBNO framework is more variationally consistent, delivering higher accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. It also lays the foundation for a robust error estimation framework in neural operator-based PDE solutions.

Abstract: Minimizing PDE-residual losses is a common strategy to promote physical consistency in neural operators. However, standard formulations often lack variational correctness, meaning that small residuals do not guarantee small solution errors due to the use of non-compliant norms or ad hoc penalty terms for boundary conditions. This work develops a variationally correct operator learning framework by constructing first-order system least-squares (FOSLS) objectives whose values are provably equivalent to the solution error in PDE-induced norms. We demonstrate this framework on stationary diffusion and linear elasticity, incorporating mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions via variational lifts to preserve norm equivalence without inconsistent penalties. To ensure the function space conformity required by the FOSLS loss, we propose a Reduced Basis Neural Operator (RBNO). The RBNO predicts coefficients for a pre-computed, conforming reduced basis, thereby ensuring variational stability by design while enabling efficient training. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis that bounds the total error by the sum of finite element discretization bias, reduced basis truncation error, neural network approximation error, and statistical estimation errors arising from finite sampling and optimization. Numerical benchmarks validate these theoretical bounds and demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy in PDE-compliant norms compared to standard baselines, while the residual loss serves as a reliable, computable a posteriori error estimator.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of capturing the essence of distributed algorithms in a concise, precise, and human-readable yet abstract manner, for improved reasoning and verification.

Method: The authors use axiomatic theories in modal logic to describe algorithms, focusing on abstract system properties rather than implementation transitions.

Result: The approach successfully scaled to multiple protocols and identified errors in an industrial protocol, showcasing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Modal logic provides a more abstract, declarative way to specify distributed algorithms, aiding in correctness, resilience, and alternative implementations, with potential benefits for human and machine verification.

Abstract: We demonstrate how to formally specify distributed algorithms as declarative axiomatic theories in a modal logic. We exhibit the method on a simple voting protocol, a simple broadcast protocol, and a simple agreement protocol. The methods scale well and have been used to find errors in a proposed industrial protocol. The key novelty is to use modal logic to capture a declarative, high-level representation of essential system properties -- the logical essence of the algorithm -- while abstracting away from transitions of an abstract machine that implements it. It is like the difference between specifying code in a functional or logic programming language, versus specifying code in an imperative one.
  A logical axiomatisation in the style we propose provides a precise, compact, human-readable specification that abstractly captures essential system properties, while eliding low-level implementation details; it is more precise than a natural language description, yet more abstract than source code or a logical specification thereof. This creates new opportunities for reasoning about correctness, resilience, and failure, and could serve as a foundation for human- and machine verification efforts, design improvements, and even alternative protocol implementations.

### [249] [Mechanism-Based Intelligence (MBI): Differentiable Incentives for Rational Coordination and Guaranteed Alignment in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20688)
*Stefano Grassi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mechanism-Based Intelligence (MBI), a paradigm solving challenges of decentralized decision-making by aligning individual and collective objectives using economic principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the fundamental challenges of autonomous decentralized multi-agent systems, including the Hayekian Information problem and Hurwiczian Incentive problem.

Method: The proposed Differentiable Price Mechanism (DPM) computes loss gradients as incentive signals, ensuring Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatibility (DSIC) and Bayesian Incentive Compatibility (BIC) to align actions with global objectives efficiently.

Result: The MBI framework achieves linear scalability with agents ($\mathcal{O}(N)$), is 50x faster than Model-Free Reinforcement Learning, and overcomes the computational complexity of Dec-POMDPs.

Conclusion: MBI is a scalable, efficient, and auditable framework that structurally aligns individual incentives with global objectives, making it an effective method for multi-agent coordination.

Abstract: Autonomous multi-agent systems are fundamentally fragile: they struggle to solve the Hayekian Information problem (eliciting dispersed private knowledge) and the Hurwiczian Incentive problem (aligning local actions with global objectives), making coordination computationally intractable. I introduce Mechanism-Based Intelligence (MBI), a paradigm that reconceptualizes intelligence as emergent from the coordination of multiple "brains", rather than a single one. At its core, the Differentiable Price Mechanism (DPM) computes the exact loss gradient $$ \mathbf{G}_i = - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{x}_i} $$ as a dynamic, VCG-equivalent incentive signal, guaranteeing Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatibility (DSIC) and convergence to the global optimum. A Bayesian extension ensures incentive compatibility under asymmetric information (BIC). The framework scales linearly ($\mathcal{O}(N)$) with the number of agents, bypassing the combinatorial complexity of Dec-POMDPs and is empirically 50x faster than Model-Free Reinforcement Learning. By structurally aligning agent self-interest with collective objectives, it provides a provably efficient, auditable and generalizable approach to coordinated, trustworthy and scalable multi-agent intelligence grounded in economic principles.

*Yue Lin,Shuhui Zhu,Wenhao Li,Ang Li,Dan Qiao,Pascal Poupart,Hongyuan Zha,Baoxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper addresses strategic adaptation in multi-agent tasks using human-readable policy representation and optimization powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the "representational bottleneck" in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, where opaque, high-dimensional policy representations hinder dynamic strategy conditioning and interpretation.

Method: The approach reformulates policy representation into human-interpretable code and employs LLMs as interpreters. The authors introduce a Programmatic Iterated Best Response (PIBR) algorithm that refines policy code by leveraging textual gradients and structured feedback.

Result: The proposed PIBR algorithm proves effective in solving coordination matrix games and the cooperative Level-Based Foraging environment.

Conclusion: The integration of programmatic policy representation with LLM-driven optimization provides a viable game-theoretic framework, enabling adaptive and interpretable strategy learning in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: In multi-agent tasks, the central challenge lies in the dynamic adaptation of strategies. However, directly conditioning on opponents' strategies is intractable in the prevalent deep reinforcement learning paradigm due to a fundamental ``representational bottleneck'': neural policies are opaque, high-dimensional parameter vectors that are incomprehensible to other agents. In this work, we propose a paradigm shift that bridges this gap by representing policies as human-interpretable source code and utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) as approximate interpreters. This programmatic representation allows us to operationalize the game-theoretic concept of \textit{Program Equilibrium}. We reformulate the learning problem by utilizing LLMs to perform optimization directly in the space of programmatic policies. The LLM functions as a point-wise best-response operator that iteratively synthesizes and refines the ego agent's policy code to respond to the opponent's strategy. We formalize this process as \textit{Programmatic Iterated Best Response (PIBR)}, an algorithm where the policy code is optimized by textual gradients, using structured feedback derived from game utility and runtime unit tests. We demonstrate that this approach effectively solves several standard coordination matrix games and a cooperative Level-Based Foraging environment.

### [251] [Towards Optimal Performance and Action Consistency Guarantees in Dec-POMDPs with Inconsistent Beliefs and Limited Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20778)
*Moshe Rafaeli Shimron,Vadim Indelman*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new decentralized framework to address inconsistent beliefs in multi-agent decision-making, providing probabilistic guarantees and controlled communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agents often operate under inconsistent beliefs due to communication constraints, leading to poor coordination and unsafe outcomes.

Method: The paper introduces a decentralized framework for joint action selection that accounts for belief inconsistencies and triggers communication only when necessary.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in multi-agent decision-making scenarios.

Conclusion: Integrating this decentralized approach improves both coordination and performance in belief-inconsistent environments, balancing communication and decision-making efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-agent decision-making under uncertainty is fundamental for effective and safe autonomous operation. In many real-world scenarios, each agent maintains its own belief over the environment and must plan actions accordingly. However, most existing approaches assume that all agents have identical beliefs at planning time, implying these beliefs are conditioned on the same data. Such an assumption is often impractical due to limited communication. In reality, agents frequently operate with inconsistent beliefs, which can lead to poor coordination and suboptimal, potentially unsafe, performance. In this paper, we address this critical challenge by introducing a novel decentralized framework for optimal joint action selection that explicitly accounts for belief inconsistencies. Our approach provides probabilistic guarantees for both action consistency and performance with respect to open-loop multi-agent POMDP (which assumes all data is always communicated), and selectively triggers communication only when needed. Furthermore, we address another key aspect of whether, given a chosen joint action, the agents should share data to improve expected performance in inference. Simulation results show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.

*Tobias von Arx,Niels Mündler,Mark Vero,Maximilian Baader,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoBaxBuilder, a framework for automated code security benchmark generation to address limitations of manual benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior benchmarks for assessing security in LLM-generated code depend heavily on manual efforts, are prone to data contamination, and cannot efficiently adapt to new tasks or challenge advanced LLMs.

Method: AutoBaxBuilder leverages LLMs’ code understanding for generating tasks and tests with fine-grained plausibility checks, focusing on security probing exploits and functionality tests.

Result: AutoBaxBuilder creates new security benchmarking tasks in under two hours at a cost of less than $10, and these tasks are comparable in quality to human-crafted benchmarks.

Conclusion: AutoBaxBuilder improves scalability and efficiency in creating security benchmarks, contributing a publicly released task suite (AutoBaxBench) for further evaluation on LLM security performance.

Abstract: As LLMs see wide adoption in software engineering, the reliable assessment of the correctness and security of LLM-generated code is crucial. Notably, prior work has demonstrated that security is often overlooked, exposing that LLMs are prone to generating code with security vulnerabilities. These insights were enabled by specialized benchmarks, crafted through significant manual effort by security experts. However, relying on manually-crafted benchmarks is insufficient in the long term, because benchmarks (i) naturally end up contaminating training data, (ii) must extend to new tasks to provide a more complete picture, and (iii) must increase in difficulty to challenge more capable LLMs. In this work, we address these challenges and present AutoBaxBuilder, a framework that generates tasks and tests for code security benchmarking from scratch. We introduce a robust pipeline with fine-grained plausibility checks, leveraging the code understanding capabilities of LLMs to construct functionality tests and end-to-end security-probing exploits. To confirm the quality of the generated benchmark, we conduct both a qualitative analysis and perform quantitative experiments, comparing it against tasks constructed by human experts. We use AutoBaxBuilder to construct entirely new tasks and release them to the public as AutoBaxBench, together with a thorough evaluation of the security capabilities of LLMs on these tasks. We find that a new task can be generated in under 2 hours, costing less than USD 10.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper examines issues in Ethereum's transaction finality latency and proposes solutions to reduce it through fast finality protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address Ethereum's delay in transaction finality, which impacts security, efficiency, and exposes the network to attacks.

Method: The study reviews fast finality frameworks, introduces theoretical primitives like reorganization resilience, and evaluates designs like the 3-slot finality protocol.

Result: Fast finality protocols balance quicker finality with maintaining Ethereum's security and scalability constraints.

Conclusion: Innovative protocols like 3-slot finality offer practical solutions to improve Ethereum's efficiency and safety in transaction settlements.

Abstract: While Ethereum has successfully achieved dynamic availability together with safety, a fundamental delay remains between transaction execution and immutable finality. In Ethereum's current Gasper protocol, this latency is on the order of 15 minutes, exposing the network to ex ante reorganization attacks, enabling MEV extraction, and limiting the efficiency of economic settlement. These limitations have motivated a growing body of work on Speedy Secure Finality (SSF), which aims to minimize confirmation latency without weakening formal security guarantees.
  This paper surveys the state of the art in fast finality protocol design. We introduce the core theoretical primitives underlying this space, including reorganization resilience and the generalized sleepy model, and trace their development from Goldfish to RLMD-GHOST. We then analyze the communication and aggregation bottlenecks faced by single-slot finality protocols in large validator settings. Finally, we survey the 3-slot finality (3SF) protocol as a practical synthesis that balances fast finality with the engineering constraints of the Ethereum network.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: zkFL-Health integrates Federated Learning, zero-knowledge proofs, and Trusted Execution Environments to ensure privacy, verifiability, and integrity for collaborative medical AI training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of privacy and governance constraints hindering collaboration for AI training across healthcare institutions.

Method: Federated Learning paired with zero-knowledge proofs and Trusted Execution Environments to ensure privacy-preserving, verifiable updates during AI training.

Result: The proposed architecture ensures privacy, integrity, and auditability in collaborative training, essential for adoption in medical AI.

Conclusion: zkFL-Health provides a robust framework for secure, collaborative, multi-institutional medical AI development compatible with regulatory demands.

Abstract: Healthcare AI needs large, diverse datasets, yet strict privacy and governance constraints prevent raw data sharing across institutions. Federated learning (FL) mitigates this by training where data reside and exchanging only model updates, but practical deployments still face two core risks: (1) privacy leakage via gradients or updates (membership inference, gradient inversion) and (2) trust in the aggregator, a single point of failure that can drop, alter, or inject contributions undetected. We present zkFL-Health, an architecture that combines FL with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deliver privacy-preserving, verifiably correct collaborative training for medical AI. Clients locally train and commit their updates; the aggregator operates within a TEE to compute the global update and produces a succinct ZK proof (via Halo2/Nova) that it used exactly the committed inputs and the correct aggregation rule, without revealing any client update to the host. Verifier nodes validate the proof and record cryptographic commitments on-chain, providing an immutable audit trail and removing the need to trust any single party. We outline system and threat models tailored to healthcare, the zkFL-Health protocol, security/privacy guarantees, and a performance evaluation plan spanning accuracy, privacy risk, latency, and cost. This framework enables multi-institutional medical AI with strong confidentiality, integrity, and auditability, key properties for clinical adoption and regulatory compliance.

*Yifan Huang,Xiaojun Jia,Wenbo Guo,Yuqiang Sun,Yihao Huang,Chong Wang,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework named SPELL to test the vulnerabilities of large language models (LLMs) in malicious code generation, achieving high success rates in attacking three advanced models and highlighting security gaps in AI safety alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the rising concern of malicious actors potentially exploiting AI coding tools, enabled by LLMs, to generate harmful software.

Method: SPELL, a testing framework, utilizes a time-division selection strategy to systematically create jailbreaking prompts from a knowledge dataset, balancing the exploration of new attacks and effective techniques.

Result: SPELL demonstrated success rates of 83.75%, 19.38%, and 68.12% across GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5, and Qwen2.5-Coder respectively, showcasing its ability to bypass security and produce malicious code across eight categories with over 73% confirmation by detection systems.

Conclusion: The findings expose significant security vulnerabilities in current LLM implementations and provide guidance for strengthening AI safety alignment in code generation systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized software development through AI-assisted coding tools, enabling developers with limited programming expertise to create sophisticated applications. However, this accessibility extends to malicious actors who may exploit these powerful tools to generate harmful software. Existing jailbreaking research primarily focuses on general attack scenarios against LLMs, with limited exploration of malicious code generation as a jailbreak target. To address this gap, we propose SPELL, a comprehensive testing framework specifically designed to evaluate the weakness of security alignment in malicious code generation. Our framework employs a time-division selection strategy that systematically constructs jailbreaking prompts by intelligently combining sentences from a prior knowledge dataset, balancing exploration of novel attack patterns with exploitation of successful techniques. Extensive evaluation across three advanced code models (GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5, and Qwen2.5-Coder) demonstrates SPELL's effectiveness, achieving attack success rates of 83.75%, 19.38%, and 68.12% respectively across eight malicious code categories. The generated prompts successfully produce malicious code in real-world AI development tools such as Cursor, with outputs confirmed as malicious by state-of-the-art detection systems at rates exceeding 73%. These findings reveal significant security gaps in current LLM implementations and provide valuable insights for improving AI safety alignment in code generation applications.

*Zhang Wei,Peilu Hu,Shengning Lang,Hao Yan,Li Mei,Yichao Zhang,Chen Yang,Junfeng Hao,Zhimo Han*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated framework for red-teaming large language models, aiming to discover vulnerabilities systematically and with scalability to replace manual testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address limitations in manual red-teaming methods for LLMs, which are inefficient, lack scalability, and fail to detect comprehensive adversarial behaviors.

Method: This automated framework integrates meta-prompting for adversarial attack synthesis, multi-modal vulnerability detection, and employs standardized evaluation processes across six major threat categories.

Result: On testing with GPT-OSS-20B model, the framework discovered 47 vulnerabilities (including 21 high-severity ones), identified 12 novel attack methods, and significantly improved the discovery rate by 3.9 times.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that automated frameworks can provide scalable, efficient, and systematic AI safety evaluations, advancing LLM security and alignment towards building trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, ensuring their security and alignment has become a critical challenge. Existing red-teaming practices depend heavily on manual testing, which limits scalability and fails to comprehensively cover the vast space of potential adversarial behaviors. This paper introduces an automated red-teaming framework that systematically generates, executes, and evaluates adversarial prompts to uncover security vulnerabilities in LLMs. Our framework integrates meta-prompting-based attack synthesis, multi-modal vulnerability detection, and standardized evaluation protocols spanning six major threat categories -- reward hacking, deceptive alignment, data exfiltration, sandbagging, inappropriate tool use, and chain-of-thought manipulation. Experiments on the GPT-OSS-20B model reveal 47 distinct vulnerabilities, including 21 high-severity and 12 novel attack patterns, achieving a $3.9\times$ improvement in vulnerability discovery rate over manual expert testing while maintaining 89\% detection accuracy. These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in enabling scalable, systematic, and reproducible AI safety evaluations. By providing actionable insights for improving alignment robustness, this work advances the state of automated LLM red-teaming and contributes to the broader goal of building secure and trustworthy AI systems.

*Omer Gazit,Yael Itzhakev,Yuval Elovici,Asaf Shabtai*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Researchers present the first physical attack on RF-based drone detectors, introducing optimized interference waveforms, which disrupt drone detection without hindering legitimate communications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from limitations in existing RF attacks, which face challenges in over-the-air implementation due to errors, interference, and hardware constraints. There's a need to address vulnerabilities in RF image-based drone detectors by exploring physical attack methods.

Method: The authors optimized universal complex baseband (I/Q) perturbation waveforms and transmitted them simultaneously with legitimate RF signals. These perturbations were tested with RF recordings and real over-the-air experiments using four different types of drones.

Result: The study demonstrated that structured, modest I/Q perturbations can effectively reduce the detection of target drones while still allowing legitimate drones to be detected, proving compatibility with standard RF systems.

Conclusion: Physical RF attacks using optimized I/Q perturbations can exploit vulnerabilities in RF image-based drone detection systems. This approach disrupts targeted detection while ensuring the integrity of legitimate transmissions.

Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) based systems are increasingly used to detect drones by analyzing their RF signal patterns, converting them into spectrogram images which are processed by object detection models. Existing RF attacks against image based models alter digital features, making over-the-air (OTA) implementation difficult due to the challenge of converting digital perturbations to transmittable waveforms that may introduce synchronization errors and interference, and encounter hardware limitations. We present the first physical attack on RF image based drone detectors, optimizing class-specific universal complex baseband (I/Q) perturbation waveforms that are transmitted alongside legitimate communications. We evaluated the attack using RF recordings and OTA experiments with four types of drones. Our results show that modest, structured I/Q perturbations are compatible with standard RF chains and reliably reduce target drone detection while preserving detection of legitimate drones.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Better Call Graphs (BCG) dataset, a high-quality and diverse collection of Android-specific function call graphs (FCGs) to improve Android malware detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of large-scale, high-quality, and diverse datasets of Android-specific function call graphs (FCGs) critical for effective malware classification.

Method: The authors created the Better Call Graphs (BCG) dataset, comprising unique and recent FCGs from both benign and malicious Android apps, along with their graph-level features. They conducted experiments using baseline classifiers to demonstrate its utility.

Result: The experiments confirm that BCG provides significant improvements over existing datasets by offering more reliable and diverse data for malware classification.

Conclusion: The introduction of BCG fills a critical gap in Android malware analysis by offering a robust and publicly accessible dataset, thereby enhancing evaluation reliability and model effectiveness in malware classification.

Abstract: Function call graphs (FCGs) have emerged as a powerful abstraction for malware detection, capturing the behavioral structure of applications beyond surface-level signatures. Their utility in traditional program analysis has been well established, enabling effective classification and analysis of malicious software. In the mobile domain, especially in the Android ecosystem, FCG-based malware classification is particularly critical due to the platform's widespread adoption and the complex, component-based structure of Android apps. However, progress in this direction is hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality Android-specific FCG datasets. Existing datasets are often outdated, dominated by small or redundant graphs resulting from app repackaging, and fail to reflect the diversity of real-world malware. These limitations lead to overfitting and unreliable evaluation of graph-based classification methods. To address this gap, we introduce Better Call Graphs (BCG), a comprehensive dataset of large and unique FCGs extracted from recent Android application packages (APKs). BCG includes both benign and malicious samples spanning various families and types, along with graph-level features for each APK. Through extensive experiments using baseline classifiers, we demonstrate the necessity and value of BCG compared to existing datasets. BCG is publicly available at https://erdemub.github.io/BCG-dataset.

*Andrew D. Blevins,Ian K. Quigley*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that machine learning models can predict chemists who created molecules based on structure alone, highlighting a potential bias in bioactivity predictions due to chemist-specific intent rather than true biological understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to investigate whether machine learning models trained on literature data inherently exploit chemists' decision-making patterns rather than uncovering fundamental structure-activity relationships, raising questions about model bias.

Method: A classifier was trained on CHEMBL assays to predict authors based on molecular fingerprints, followed by training an activity model to predict bioactivity using only author probabilities linked to molecules.

Result: The author-based model achieved comparable predictive power to models that use molecular structure directly, indicating that the models heavily rely on chemist-specific patterns rather than biological insights.

Conclusion: The study highlights a bias in activity models, suggesting that machine learning can ascribe chemist intent to bioactivity predictions. The authors propose author-disjoint splits and better dataset practices to mitigate this issue.

Abstract: Can machine learning models identify which chemist made a molecule from structure alone? If so, models trained on literature data may exploit chemist intent rather than learning causal structure-activity relationships. We test this by linking CHEMBL assays to publication authors and training a 1,815-class classifier to predict authors from molecular fingerprints, achieving 60% top-5 accuracy under scaffold-based splitting. We then train an activity model that receives only a protein identifier and an author-probability vector derived from structure, with no direct access to molecular descriptors. This author-only model achieves predictive power comparable to a simple baseline that has access to structure. This reveals a "Clever Hans" failure mode: models can predict bioactivity largely by inferring chemist goals and favorite targets without requiring a lab-independent understanding of chemistry. We analyze the sources of this leakage, propose author-disjoint splits, and recommend dataset practices to decouple chemist intent from biological outcomes.

Motivation: The paper aims to understand how advancements in LLMs, linked to compute and algorithmic progress, affect professional productivity across various work tasks.

Method: It used a preregistered experiment where over 500 professionals completed work tasks with 13 LLMs to analyze productivity impacts.

Result: Discovering an 8% yearly reduction in task time due to AI progress, with differing impacts on analytical versus agentic tasks and a model-predicted potential 20% boost in U.S. productivity within a decade.

Conclusion: Scaling LLMs positively impacts productivity, driven by compute and algorithm improvements, though impact varies by task type; further scaling is likely to enhance national productivity significantly.

Abstract: This paper derives `Scaling Laws for Economic Impacts' -- empirical relationships between the training compute of Large Language Models (LLMs) and professional productivity. In a preregistered experiment, over 500 consultants, data analysts, and managers completed professional tasks using one of 13 LLMs. We find that each year of AI model progress reduced task time by 8%, with 56% of gains driven by increased compute and 44% by algorithmic progress. However, productivity gains were significantly larger for non-agentic analytical tasks compared to agentic workflows requiring tool use. These findings suggest continued model scaling could boost U.S. productivity by approximately 20% over the next decade.

*Ian Bounos,Pablo Groisman,Mariela Sued,Esteban Tabak*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to extract invariant features that predict a response variable without being confounded by other variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a feature extraction methodology that isolates prediction variables from confounding influences while maintaining response accuracy.

Method: The approach involves penalizing statistical dependence of features with confounders, utilizing optimal transport theory, and leveraging Gaussian conditions for simplifications.

Result: The proposed method yields a linear feature extractor that is robust to confounding variables, extendable to non-linear cases and general non-Gaussian distributions.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively identifies invariant features for unbiased predictions, showcasing flexibility for diverse data properties and confounding challenges.

Abstract: A methodology is developed to extract $d$ invariant features $W=f(X)$ that predict a response variable $Y$ without being confounded by variables $Z$ that may influence both $X$ and $Y$.
  The methodology's main ingredient is the penalization of any statistical dependence between $W$ and $Z$ conditioned on $Y$, replaced by the more readily implementable plain independence between $W$ and the random variable $Z_Y = T(Z,Y)$ that solves the [Monge] Optimal Transport Barycenter Problem for $Z\mid Y$. In the Gaussian case considered in this article, the two statements are equivalent.
  When the true confounders $Z$ are unknown, other measurable contextual variables $S$ can be used as surrogates, a replacement that involves no relaxation in the Gaussian case if the covariance matrix $Σ_{ZS}$ has full range. The resulting linear feature extractor adopts a closed form in terms of the first $d$ eigenvectors of a known matrix. The procedure extends with little change to more general, non-Gaussian / non-linear cases.

TL;DR: The paper examines the challenge of ranking experts using their answers to questions in a crowd-sourcing model while addressing computational-statistical gaps. It also investigates sub-matrix problems to build towards the general ranking challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty in accurately ranking experts based on their abilities using a general isotonic crowd-sourcing model, which assumes varying levels of expert competency represented in a structured matrix.

Method: Investigates the isotonic crowd-sourcing model by formulating it based on permutations and constraints in the matrix $M$, and also explores sub-matrix detection/estimation as simpler sub-problems to derive key insights.

Result: The authors present results and proof techniques for sub-matrix problems, showing the lack of computational-statistical gaps, and extend these findings to improve understanding and approaches for the general ranking problem.

Conclusion: The research advances knowledge in expert ranking within crowd-sourcing frameworks, ensuring computational efficiency and statistical optimality while paving the way for future studies on related ranking challenges.

Abstract: We consider the problem of ranking $n$ experts according to their abilities, based on the correctness of their answers to $d$ questions. This is modeled by the so-called crowd-sourcing model, where the answer of expert $i$ on question $k$ is modeled by a random entry, parametrized by $M_{i,k}$ which is increasing linearly with the expected quality of the answer. To enable the unambiguous ranking of the experts by ability, several assumptions on $M$ are available in the literature. We consider here the general isotonic crowd-sourcing model, where $M$ is assumed to be isotonic up to an unknown permutation $π^*$ of the experts - namely, $M_{π^{*-1}(i),k} \geq M_{π^{*-1}(i+1),k}$ for any $i\in [n-1], k \in [d]$. Then, ranking experts amounts to constructing an estimator of $π^*$. In particular, we investigate here the existence of statistically optimal and computationally efficient procedures and we describe recent results that disprove the existence of computational-statistical gaps for this problem. To provide insights on the key ideas, we start by discussing simpler and yet related sub-problems, namely sub-matrix detection and estimation. This corresponds to specific instances of the ranking problem where the matrix $M$ is constrained to be of the form $λ\mathbf 1\{S\times T\}$ where $S\subset [n], T\subset [d]$. This model has been extensively studied. We provide an overview of the results and proof techniques for this problem with a particular emphasis on the computational lower bounds based on low-degree polynomial methods. Then, we build upon this instrumental sub-problem to discuss existing results and algorithmic ideas for the general ranking problem.

TL;DR: The paper presents a random gradient-free optimization method in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, simplifying computation by using directional derivatives and pre-bases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of optimizing in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and avoid the computational difficulties of infinite-dimensional gradients, enabling broader applications.

Method: The method relies on directional derivatives and pre-bases (dense, linearly-independent sets) in Hilbert spaces, bypassing the need for full orthonormal bases or reproducing kernels.

Result: This approach simplifies Hilbert space optimization and is effective, demonstrated in solving partial differential equations akin to physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), with provable convergence.

Conclusion: The proposed method combines theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility, broadening the scope of functional optimization in infinite-dimensional spaces.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a random gradient-free method for optimization in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, applicable to functional optimization in diverse settings. Though such problems are often solved through finite-dimensional gradient descent over a parametrization of the functions, such as neural networks, an interesting alternative is to instead perform gradient descent directly in the function space by leveraging its Hilbert space structure, thus enabling provable guarantees and fast convergence. However, infinite-dimensional gradients are often hard to compute in practice, hindering the applicability of such methods. To overcome this limitation, our framework requires only the computation of directional derivatives and a pre-basis for the Hilbert space domain, i.e., a linearly-independent set whose span is dense in the Hilbert space. This fully resolves the tractability issue, as pre-bases are much more easily obtained than full orthonormal bases or reproducing kernels -- which may not even exist -- and individual directional derivatives can be easily computed using forward-mode scalar automatic differentiation. We showcase the use of our method to solve partial differential equations à la physics informed neural networks (PINNs), where it effectively enables provable convergence.

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes LIRE++, a rotationally-equivariant, multiscale approach for fast and memory-efficient Cone Beam CT (CBCT) reconstruction, showcasing improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to tackle challenges in CBCT such as lower image quality compared to conventional CT, lack of ground truth data, memory limitations, and the need for fast inference.

Method: They introduced LIRE++, a learned invertible primal-dual scheme with rotational equivariance and multiscale techniques, trained on simulated projection data using their own CBCT simulation framework.

Result: LIRE++ demonstrated a 1 dB improvement in synthetic data Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and reduced Mean Absolute Error by 10 Hounsfield Units on clinical data compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: LIRE++ offers a promising deep learning-based solution for improving CBCT reconstruction accuracy and efficiency, addressing clinical and computational challenges.

Abstract: Cone Beam CT (CBCT) is an important imaging modality nowadays, however lower image quality of CBCT compared to more conventional Computed Tomography (CT) remains a limiting factor in CBCT applications. Deep learning reconstruction methods are a promising alternative to classical analytical and iterative reconstruction methods, but applying such methods to CBCT is often difficult due to the lack of ground truth data, memory limitations and the need for fast inference at clinically-relevant resolutions. In this work we propose LIRE++, an end-to-end rotationally-equivariant multiscale learned invertible primal-dual scheme for fast and memory-efficient CBCT reconstruction. Memory optimizations and multiscale reconstruction allow for fast training and inference, while rotational equivariance improves parameter efficiency. LIRE++ was trained on simulated projection data from a fast quasi-Monte Carlo CBCT projection simulator that we developed as well. Evaluated on synthetic data, LIRE++ gave an average improvement of 1 dB in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio over alternative deep learning baselines. On real clinical data, LIRE++ improved the average Mean Absolute Error between the reconstruction and the corresponding planning CT by 10 Hounsfield Units with respect to current proprietary state-of-the-art hybrid deep-learning/iterative method.

*Artem Goncharov,Rajesh Ghosh,Hyou-Arm Joung,Dino Di Carlo,Aydogan Ozcan*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces an uncertainty quantification method that improves the reliability and sensitivity of neural network-driven point-of-care diagnostics, specifically tested on a platform for Lyme disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural network-based diagnostic systems are prone to hallucinations and erroneous predictions, threatening clinical decision accuracy. Reliable uncertainty quantification is needed to prevent misdiagnosis and improve trustworthiness.

Method: The study incorporates Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO)-based uncertainty quantification into a computational vertical flow assay (xVFA) for Lyme disease, integrating a paper-based assay, handheld optical reader, and neural network algorithm.

Result: Adding MCDO-based uncertainty quantification autonomously excluded predictions with high uncertainty, increasing diagnostic sensitivity from 88.2% to 95.7% in blinded patient testing.

Conclusion: The integration of uncertainty quantification tools enhances the robustness of computational POC systems, making them safer and more reliable for medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Computational point-of-care (POC) sensors enable rapid, low-cost, and accessible diagnostics in emergency, remote and resource-limited areas that lack access to centralized medical facilities. These systems can utilize neural network-based algorithms to accurately infer a diagnosis from the signals generated by rapid diagnostic tests or sensors. However, neural network-based diagnostic models are subject to hallucinations and can produce erroneous predictions, posing a risk of misdiagnosis and inaccurate clinical decisions. To address this challenge, here we present an autonomous uncertainty quantification technique developed for POC diagnostics. As our testbed, we used a paper-based, computational vertical flow assay (xVFA) platform developed for rapid POC diagnosis of Lyme disease, the most prevalent tick-borne disease globally. The xVFA platform integrates a disposable paper-based assay, a handheld optical reader and a neural network-based inference algorithm, providing rapid and cost-effective Lyme disease diagnostics in under 20 min using only 20 uL of patient serum. By incorporating a Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO)-based uncertainty quantification approach into the diagnostics pipeline, we identified and excluded erroneous predictions with high uncertainty, significantly improving the sensitivity and reliability of the xVFA in an autonomous manner, without access to the ground truth diagnostic information of patients. Blinded testing using new patient samples demonstrated an increase in diagnostic sensitivity from 88.2% to 95.7%, indicating the effectiveness of MCDO-based uncertainty quantification in enhancing the robustness of neural network-driven computational POC sensing systems.

*Shaowen Qin,Jianfeng Zeng,Haodong Guo,Xiaohuan Li,Jiawen Kang,Qian Chen,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper proposes FEIBN, a framework using federated learning and strategy-aware mechanisms to enhance intent-based networking in IIoT environments, achieving high efficiency and cost savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address impracticalities of frequent strategy deployment in IIoT systems caused by tightly coupled workflows, high downtime costs, and challenges of centralized policy verification due to IIoT heterogeneity and privacy constraints.

Method: FEIBN utilizes LLMs to structure user intents into strategies and employs federated learning for distributed policy verification. It also introduces SSAFL, a mechanism that selects task-relevant nodes and triggers asynchronous model updates based on strategy similarity and resource status.

Result: The experiments show that SSAFL improves model accuracy, accelerates convergence, and reduces communication costs by 27.8% compared to SemiAsyn.

Conclusion: FEIBN effectively addresses the challenges of implementing IBN in IIoT contexts, providing a scalable and resource-efficient solution by combining LLMs and federated learning technologies.

Abstract: Intent-Based Networking (IBN) offers a promising paradigm for intelligent and automated network control in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments by translating high-level user intents into executable network strategies. However, frequent strategy deployment and rollback are impractical in real-world IIoT systems due to tightly coupled workflows and high downtime costs, while the heterogeneity and privacy constraints of IIoT nodes further complicate centralized policy verification. To address these challenges, we propose FEIBN, a Federated Evaluation Enhanced Intent-Based Networking framework. FEIBN leverages large language models (LLMs) to align multimodal user intents into structured strategy tuples and employs federated learning to perform distributed policy verification across IIoT nodes without exposing raw data. To improve training efficiency and reduce communication overhead, we design SSAFL, a Strategy Similarity Aware Federated Learning mechanism that selects task-relevant nodes based on strategy similarity and resource status, and triggers asynchronous model uploads only when updates are significant. Experiments demonstrate that SSAFL can improve model accuracy, accelerate model convergence, and reduce the cost by 27.8% compared with SemiAsyn.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve the demanding 6G wireless benchmarks such as Tb/s data rates, sub-millisecond latency, and massive IoT/vehicle connectivity while addressing spectrum scarcity and high energy consumption in classical CRNs.

Method: The proposed framework integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL), transfer learning, energy harvesting (EH), reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), and genetic refinement to optimize sensing timelines, transmit power, bandwidth distribution, and RIS phase selection.

Result: Compared to baselines, the framework demonstrates 25-30% energy savings, over 0.90 sensing AUC, and 6-13 percentage points higher packet delivery ratio (PDR) under dense loads using MATLAB and NS-3 simulations.

Conclusion: The integrated green CRN framework is scalable, energy-efficient, and provides a sustainable approach for 6G wireless communication, particularly in large IoT and vehicular applications.

Abstract: The 6G wireless aims at the Tb/s peak data rates are expected, a sub-millisecond latency, massive Internet of Things/vehicle connectivity, which requires sustainable access to audio over the air and energy-saving functionality. Cognitive Radio Networks CCNs help in alleviating the problem of spectrum scarcity, but classical sensing and allocation are still energy-consumption intensive, and sensitive to rapid spectrum variations. Our framework which centers on AI driven green CRN aims at integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with transfer learning, energy harvesting (EH), reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with other light-weight genetic refinement operations that optimally combine sensing timelines, transmit power, bandwidth distribution and RIS phase selection. Compared to two baselines, the utilization of MATLAB + NS-3 under dense loads, a traditional CRN with energy sensing under fixed policies, and a hybrid CRN with cooperative sensing under heuristic distribution of resource, there are (25-30%) fewer energy reserves used, sensing AUC greater than 0.90 and +6-13 p.p. higher PDR. The integrated framework is easily scalable to large IoT and vehicular applications, and it provides a feasible and sustainable roadmap to 6G CRNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges posed by dynamic task criticality and the mobility of WBAN users and UAVs in IoMT networks, aiming to improve real-time biomedical edge computing performance.

Method: A hierarchical multi-scale Transformer-based user trajectory prediction model and a prediction-enhanced DRL algorithm were developed to optimize UAV flight trajectory and task offloading.

Result: Simulations using real-world movement traces show that the proposed methods outperform existing benchmarks in improving task completion time and UAV efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances UAV-based edge computing in IoMT networks, solving challenges of mobility and energy constraints while improving efficiency.

Abstract: Due to their inherent flexibility and autonomous operation, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to provide real-time biomedical edge computing service for wireless body area network (WBAN) users. In this paper, considering the time-varying task criticality characteristics of diverse WBAN users and the dual mobility between WBAN users and UAV, we investigate the dynamic task offloading and UAV flight trajectory optimization problem to minimize the weighted average task completion time of all the WBAN users, under the constraint of UAV energy consumption. To tackle the problem, an embodied AI-enhanced IoMT edge computing framework is established. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical multi-scale Transformer-based user trajectory prediction model based on the users' historical trajectory traces captured by the embodied AI agent (i.e., UAV). Afterwards, a prediction-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that integrates predicted users' mobility information is designed for intelligently optimizing UAV flight trajectory and task offloading decisions. Real-word movement traces and simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods in comparison with the existing benchmarks.

### [269] [A Physics Informed Neural Network For Deriving MHD State Vectors From Global Active Regions Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20747)
*Subhamoy Chatterjee,Mausumi Dikpati*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based simulator, PINNBARDS, to predict solar flare-producing active regions using magnetic structures and MHD models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flare-producing solar active regions require early prediction based on accurate initialization of magnetohydrodynamic state-vectors derived from observational data. Current methods lack such capability.

Method: The authors developed PINNBARDS, a physics-informed neural network leveraging observed magnetic toroidal bands and MHD equations to reconstruct the hidden tachocline magnetic state-vectors.

Result: PINNBARDS produced self-consistent, physically accurate toroids that aligned well with observations, especially for toroidal magnetic field strengths around 20-30 kG, enabling predictions.

Conclusion: PINNBARDS establishes a novel approach to infer tachocline magnetic structures and serves as a foundation for week-ahead predictions of flare-producing active regions in solar studies.

Abstract: Solar active regions (ARs) do not appear randomly but cluster along longitudinally warped toroidal bands ('toroids') that encode information about magnetic structures in the tachocline, where global-scale organization likely originates. Global MagnetoHydroDynamic Shallow-Water Tachocline (MHD-SWT) models have shown potential to simulate such toroids, matching observations qualitatively. For week-scale early prediction of flare-producing AR emergence, forward-integration of these toroids is necessary. This requires model initialization with a dynamically self-consistent MHD state-vector that includes magnetic, flow fields, and shell-thickness variations. However, synoptic magnetograms provide only geometric shape of toroids, not the state-vector needed to initialize MHD-SWT models. To address this challenging task, we develop PINNBARDS, a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)-Based AR Distribution Simulator, that uses observational toroids and MHD-SWT equations to derive initial state-vector. Using Feb-14-2024 SDO/HMI synoptic map, we show that PINN converges to physically consistent, predominantly antisymmetric toroids, matching observed ones. Although surface data provides north and south toroids' central latitudes, and their latitudinal widths, they cannot determine tachocline field strengths, connected to AR emergence. We explore here solutions across a broad parameter range, finding hydrodynamically-dominated structures for weak fields (~2 kG) and overly rigid behavior for strong fields (~100 kG). We obtain best agreement with observations for 20-30 kG toroidal fields, and ~10 degree bandwidth, consistent with low-order longitudinal mode excitation. To our knowledge, PINNBARDS serves as the first method for reconstructing state-vectors for hidden tachocline magnetic structures from surface patterns; potentially leading to weeks ahead prediction of flare-producing AR-emergence.

*Xiao-Qi Han,Ze-Feng Gao,Peng-Jie Guo,Zhong-Yi Lu*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: This paper introduces PhononBench, a large-scale benchmark for testing dynamical stability in AI-generated crystals, analyzing over 108,000 structures. Current generative models show widespread limitations, with an average stability rate of 25.83% across generated structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of large-scale benchmarks for evaluating dynamical stability in AI-generated crystals and improve the reliability of generated materials for practical use.

Method: PhononBench assesses dynamical stability using the MatterSim interatomic potential, performing detailed phonon calculations and analyzing over 108,000 crystal structures from six advanced generation models.

Result: Findings reveal a low dynamical-stability rate (only 25.83% on average), with the best-performing model achieving 41%. High-symmetry crystals perform slightly better, and 28,119 stable structures are identified.

Conclusion: PhononBench highlights the need for improvement in crystal generative models and provides essential tools, benchmarks, and datasets for guiding future advancements in stable materials design.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce PhononBench, the first large-scale benchmark for dynamical stability in AI-generated crystals. Leveraging the recently developed MatterSim interatomic potential, which achieves DFT-level accuracy in phonon predictions across more than 10,000 materials, PhononBench enables efficient large-scale phonon calculations and dynamical-stability analysis for 108,843 crystal structures generated by six leading crystal generation models. PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV. In space-group-controlled generation, higher-symmetry crystals exhibit better stability (e.g., cubic systems achieve rates up to 49.2%), yet the average stability across all controlled generations is still only 34.4%. An important additional outcome of this study is the identification of 28,119 crystal structures that are phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone, providing a substantial pool of reliable candidates for future materials exploration. By establishing the first large-scale dynamical-stability benchmark, this work systematically highlights the current limitations of crystal generation models and offers essential evaluation criteria and guidance for their future development toward the design and discovery of physically viable materials. All model-generated crystal structures, phonon calculation results, and the high-throughput evaluation workflows developed in PhononBench will be openly released at https://github.com/xqh19970407/PhononBench

*Zhe Wang,Jinghang Li,Yifei Zhu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces AirGS, a 4D Gaussian Splatting framework to optimize free-viewpoint video streaming, enhancing quality and reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing 4D Gaussian Splatting techniques, such as quality degradation over long sequences, substantial bandwidth, and storage requirements.

Method: AirGS involves converting Gaussian streams to multi-channel 2D formats, incorporating intelligent keyframe identification, temporal coherence, inflation loss, and adaptive pruning using an integer linear programming approach.

Result: AirGS reduces quality degradation by 20% (PSNR), keeps frame-level PSNR consistently above 30, accelerates training by 6x, and reduces transmission size by nearly 50%.

Conclusion: AirGS offers a significant improvement in quality, efficiency, and bandwidth optimization, making it suitable for real-time and large-scale free-viewpoint video applications.

Abstract: Free-viewpoint video (FVV) enables immersive viewing experiences by allowing users to view scenes from arbitrary perspectives. As a prominent reconstruction technique for FVV generation, 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) models dynamic scenes with time-varying 3D Gaussian ellipsoids and achieves high-quality rendering via fast rasterization. However, existing 4DGS approaches suffer from quality degradation over long sequences and impose substantial bandwidth and storage overhead, limiting their applicability in real-time and wide-scale deployments. Therefore, we present AirGS, a streaming-optimized 4DGS framework that rearchitects the training and delivery pipeline to enable high-quality, low-latency FVV experiences. AirGS converts Gaussian video streams into multi-channel 2D formats and intelligently identifies keyframes to enhance frame reconstruction quality. It further combines temporal coherence with inflation loss to reduce training time and representation size. To support communication-efficient transmission, AirGS models 4DGS delivery as an integer linear programming problem and design a lightweight pruning level selection algorithm to adaptively prune the Gaussian updates to be transmitted, balancing reconstruction quality and bandwidth consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AirGS reduces quality deviation in PSNR by more than 20% when scene changes, maintains frame-level PSNR consistently above 30, accelerates training by 6 times, reduces per-frame transmission size by nearly 50% compared to the SOTA 4DGS approaches.

*Jaeseong Lee,Junyeong Ahn,Taewoong Kang,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: TexAvatars enhances 3D head avatars with a hybrid representation combining geometric grounding and spatial continuity for improved generalization and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the generalization and fidelity of 3D head avatars for AR/XR applications, addressing weaknesses in existing methods under extreme poses and expressions.

Method: The authors introduce TexAvatars, a hybrid avatar representation combining analytic rigging’s geometric consistency with neural network-based texel space to predict local attributes in UV space and drive deformation using mesh-aware Jacobians.

Result: TexAvatars effectively captures fine-grained expression and complex head movements, demonstrating strong generalization and achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: TexAvatars bridges the gap between semantic modeling and geometric control, enabling more expressive, stable, and interpretable head avatars well-suited for challenging AR/XR environments.

Abstract: Constructing drivable and photorealistic 3D head avatars has become a central task in AR/XR, enabling immersive and expressive user experiences. With the emergence of high-fidelity and efficient representations such as 3D Gaussians, recent works have pushed toward ultra-detailed head avatars. Existing approaches typically fall into two categories: rule-based analytic rigging or neural network-based deformation fields. While effective in constrained settings, both approaches often fail to generalize to unseen expressions and poses, particularly in extreme reenactment scenarios. Other methods constrain Gaussians to the global texel space of 3DMMs to reduce rendering complexity. However, these texel-based avatars tend to underutilize the underlying mesh structure. They apply minimal analytic deformation and rely heavily on neural regressors and heuristic regularization in UV space, which weakens geometric consistency and limits extrapolation to complex, out-of-distribution deformations. To address these limitations, we introduce TexAvatars, a hybrid avatar representation that combines the explicit geometric grounding of analytic rigging with the spatial continuity of texel space. Our approach predicts local geometric attributes in UV space via CNNs, but drives 3D deformation through mesh-aware Jacobians, enabling smooth and semantically meaningful transitions across triangle boundaries. This hybrid design separates semantic modeling from geometric control, resulting in improved generalization, interpretability, and stability. Furthermore, TexAvatars captures fine-grained expression effects, including muscle-induced wrinkles, glabellar lines, and realistic mouth cavity geometry, with high fidelity. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under extreme pose and expression variations, demonstrating strong generalization in challenging head reenactment settings.
