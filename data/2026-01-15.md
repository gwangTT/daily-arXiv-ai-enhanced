### [1] [ConvoLearn: A Dataset of Constructivist Tutor-Student Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08950)
*Mayank Sharma,Roy Pea,Hari Subramonyam*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConvoLearn, a dataset designed for improving educational AI tools, with significant results in enhancing dialogic learning for middle school science classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the pedagogical limitations of LLMs in educational applications, particularly their lack of dialogic learning support.

Method: Created a semi-synthetic dataset of tutor-student dialogues based on six pedagogical dimensions, fine-tuned an LLM (Mistral 7B) using QLoRA, and evaluated its behavior through human teacher assessments.

Result: Fine-tuned Mistral 7B demonstrated significant improvement in pedagogical approach compared to its base version and competitors, as assessed by teachers.

Conclusion: This work provides a framework for developing constructivist AI tutors, enhancing their educational effectiveness through tailored datasets and training.

Abstract: In educational applications, LLMs exhibit several fundamental pedagogical limitations, such as their tendency to reveal solutions rather than support dialogic learning. We introduce ConvoLearn (https://huggingface.co/datasets/masharma/convolearn ), a dataset grounded in knowledge building theory that operationalizes six core pedagogical dimensions: cognitive engagement, formative assessment, accountability, cultural responsiveness, metacognition, and power dynamics. We construct a semi-synthetic dataset of 1250 tutor-student dialogues (20 turns each) in middle school Earth Science through controlled interactions between human teachers and a simulated student. Using QLoRA, we demonstrate that training on this dataset meaningfully shifts LLM behavior toward knowledge-building strategies. Human evaluation by 31 teachers shows our fine-tuned Mistral 7B (M = 4.10, SD = 1.03) significantly outperforms both its base version (M = 2.59, SD = 1.11) and Claude Sonnet 4.5 (M = 2.87, SD = 1.29) overall. This work establishes a potential framework to guide future development and evaluation of constructivist AI tutors.

### [2] [ART: Action-based Reasoning Task Benchmarking for Medical AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08988)
*Ananya Mantravadi,Shivali Dalmia,Abhishek Mukherji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ART, a clinical task benchmark for testing medical AI's reasoning on structured EHRs, highlighting significant errors in aggregation and threshold reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address weaknesses of existing medical benchmarks for AI on action-oriented reasoning tasks using structured EHRs.

Method: Proposed ART, a benchmark containing reasoning tasks created through a four-step pipeline: scenario identification, task generation, quality audit, and evaluation, based on real EHR data.

Result: Current models like GPT-4o-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet perform well in retrieval tasks but show significant errors in aggregation and threshold reasoning.

Conclusion: ART identifies reasoning weaknesses and enhances progress toward developing safer, more reliable clinical decision-support AI agents.

Abstract: Reliable clinical decision support requires medical AI agents capable of safe, multi-step reasoning over structured electronic health records (EHRs). While large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare, existing benchmarks inadequately assess performance on action-based tasks involving threshold evaluation, temporal aggregation, and conditional logic. We introduce ART, an Action-based Reasoning clinical Task benchmark for medical AI agents, which mines real-world EHR data to create challenging tasks targeting known reasoning weaknesses. Through analysis of existing benchmarks, we identify three dominant error categories: retrieval failures, aggregation errors, and conditional logic misjudgments. Our four-stage pipeline -- scenario identification, task generation, quality audit, and evaluation -- produces diverse, clinically validated tasks grounded in real patient data. Evaluating GPT-4o-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on 600 tasks shows near-perfect retrieval after prompt refinement, but substantial gaps in aggregation (28--64%) and threshold reasoning (32--38%). By exposing failure modes in action-oriented EHR reasoning, ART advances toward more reliable clinical agents, an essential step for AI systems that reduce cognitive load and administrative burden, supporting workforce capacity in high-demand care settings

### [3] [The Hierarchy of Agentic Capabilities: Evaluating Frontier Models on Realistic RL Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09032)
*Logan Ritchie,Sushant Mehta,Nick Heiner,Mason Yu,Edwin Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study evaluates AI models' performance on workplace tasks and identifies key capabilities required for real-world deployment and their limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancements in LLM-based agents demand thorough evaluation in interactive environments to determine their readiness for real-world applications.

Method: The study assesses AI models on 150 tasks within a realistic e-commerce RL environment, analyzing a hierarchy of capabilities needed for task completion.

Result: Models fail around 40% of tasks, revealing predictable weaknesses depending on their competency level, with stronger models struggling with contextual inference.

Conclusion: Current frontier models exhibit multi-step task capabilities but require significant improvements to achieve human-level task performance in workplace environments.

Abstract: The advancement of large language model (LLM) based agents has shifted AI evaluation from single-turn response assessment to multi-step task completion in interactive environments. We present an empirical study evaluating frontier AI models on 150 workplace tasks within a realistic e-commerce RL environment from Surge. Our analysis reveals an empirically-derived \emph{hierarchy of agentic capabilities} that models must master for real-world deployment: (1) tool use, (2) planning and goal formation, (3) adaptability, (4) groundedness, and (5) common-sense reasoning. Even the best-performing models fail approximately 40\% of the tasks, with failures clustering predictably along this hierarchy. Weaker models struggle with fundamental tool use and planning, whereas stronger models primarily fail on tasks requiring contextual inference beyond explicit instructions. We introduce a task-centric design methodology for RL environments that emphasizes diversity and domain expert contributions, provide detailed failure analysis, and discuss implications for agent development. Our findings suggest that while current frontier models can demonstrate coherent multi-step behavior, substantial capability gaps remain before achieving human-level task completion in realistic workplace settings.

### [4] [Human-AI Co-design for Clinical Prediction Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09072)
*Jean Feng,Avni Kothari,Patrick Vossler,Andrew Bishara,Lucas Zier,Newton Addo,Aaron Kornblith,Yan Shuo Tan,Chandan Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents HACHI, a human-in-the-loop framework combining AI agents and clinical experts to build interpretable clinical prediction models from structured and unstructured data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods of developing clinical prediction models are time-intensive, limiting their integration into clinical practice, particularly when handling unstructured data like clinical notes.

Method: HACHI alternates between AI-driven exploration of clinical note concepts and expert feedback, utilizing yes-no questions to build interpretable linear models.

Result: HACHI improves prediction performance, identifies novel clinical concepts, enhances model generalizability across different sites and time periods, and mitigates issues like data bias and leakage.

Conclusion: HACHI showcases the importance of human expertise in guiding AI and demonstrates its capability to accelerate interpretable and effective CPM development, facilitating clinical practice integration.

Abstract: Developing safe, effective, and practically useful clinical prediction models (CPMs) traditionally requires iterative collaboration between clinical experts, data scientists, and informaticists. This process refines the often small but critical details of the model building process, such as which features/patients to include and how clinical categories should be defined. However, this traditional collaboration process is extremely time- and resource-intensive, resulting in only a small fraction of CPMs reaching clinical practice. This challenge intensifies when teams attempt to incorporate unstructured clinical notes, which can contain an enormous number of concepts. To address this challenge, we introduce HACHI, an iterative human-in-the-loop framework that uses AI agents to accelerate the development of fully interpretable CPMs by enabling the exploration of concepts in clinical notes. HACHI alternates between (i) an AI agent rapidly exploring and evaluating candidate concepts in clinical notes and (ii) clinical and domain experts providing feedback to improve the CPM learning process. HACHI defines concepts as simple yes-no questions that are used in linear models, allowing the clinical AI team to transparently review, refine, and validate the CPM learned in each round. In two real-world prediction tasks (acute kidney injury and traumatic brain injury), HACHI outperforms existing approaches, surfaces new clinically relevant concepts not included in commonly-used CPMs, and improves model generalizability across clinical sites and time periods. Furthermore, HACHI reveals the critical role of the clinical AI team, such as directing the AI agent to explore concepts that it had not previously considered, adjusting the granularity of concepts it considers, changing the objective function to better align with the clinical objectives, and identifying issues of data bias and leakage.

### [5] [Programming over Thinking: Efficient and Robust Multi-Constraint Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09097)
*Derrick Goh Xin Deik,Quanyu Long,Zhengyuan Liu,Nancy F. Chen,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SCOPE introduces a framework for multi-constraint planning that separates reasoning from execution, showing state-of-the-art performance, cost efficiency, and reusability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-constraint planning with large language models either suffer from errors and high costs in reasoning approaches or lack flexibility in solver-based strategies.

Method: SCOPE disentangles query-specific reasoning from generic code execution, enabling consistent, deterministic, and reusable solver functions for diverse problems.

Result: SCOPE achieves 93.1% success on TravelPlanner dataset, outperforms the previous baseline by 61.6%, reduces inference cost by 1.4x, and speeds up processing time by 4.67x using GPT-4o.

Conclusion: SCOPE is a flexible and efficient framework for multi-constraint planning, overcoming limitations of traditional LLM approaches and improving performance and cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: Multi-constraint planning involves identifying, evaluating, and refining candidate plans while satisfying multiple, potentially conflicting constraints. Existing large language model (LLM) approaches face fundamental limitations in this domain. Pure reasoning paradigms, which rely on long natural language chains, are prone to inconsistency, error accumulation, and prohibitive cost as constraints compound. Conversely, LLMs combined with coding- or solver-based strategies lack flexibility: they often generate problem-specific code from scratch or depend on fixed solvers, failing to capture generalizable logic across diverse problems. To address these challenges, we introduce the Scalable COde Planning Engine (SCOPE), a framework that disentangles query-specific reasoning from generic code execution. By separating reasoning from execution, SCOPE produces solver functions that are consistent, deterministic, and reusable across queries while requiring only minimal changes to input parameters. SCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance while lowering cost and latency. For example, with GPT-4o, it reaches 93.1% success on TravelPlanner, a 61.6% gain over the best baseline (CoT) while cutting inference cost by 1.4x and time by ~4.67x.

### [6] [DScheLLM: Enabling Dynamic Scheduling through a Fine-Tuned Dual-System Large language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09100)
*Lixiang Zhang,Chenggong Zhao,Qing Gao,Xiaoke Zhao,Gengyi Bai,Jinhu Lv*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DScheLLM is introduced to enhance dynamic production scheduling by leveraging large language models (LLMs) with dual system reasoning for addressing various disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional production scheduling methods struggle to adapt to dynamic disruptions like task insertions and machine variability. DScheLLM aims to address this gap by applying LLMs to better handle unforeseen disturbances.

Method: The paper proposes a dual-system (fast-slow reasoning) approach, utilizing a fine-tuned LLM, structured datasets from OR solvers, and the Huawei OpenPangu Embedded-7B model with LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: Tests on standard job shop scheduling benchmarks show the system efficiently generates quality schedules and provides solver-compatible decision inputs for dynamic environments.

Conclusion: This study pioneers applying LLMs in dynamic job shop scheduling, showcasing their adaptability and potential in intelligent scheduling optimization.

Abstract: Production scheduling is highly susceptible to dynamic disruptions, such as variations in processing times, machine availability, and unexpected task insertions. Conventional approaches typically rely on event-specific models and explicit analytical formulations, which limits their adaptability and generalization across previously unseen disturbances. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes DScheLLM, a dynamic scheduling approach that leverages fine-tuned large language models within a dual-system (fast-slow) reasoning architecture to address disturbances of different scales. A unified large language model-based framework is constructed to handle dynamic events, where training datasets for both fast and slow reasoning modes are generated using exact schedules obtained from an operations research solver. The Huawei OpenPangu Embedded-7B model is subsequently fine-tuned under the hybrid reasoning paradigms using LoRA. Experimental evaluations on standard job shop scheduling benchmarks demonstrate that the fast-thinking mode can efficiently generate high-quality schedules and the slow-thinking mode can produce solver-compatible and well-formatted decision inputs. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents one of the earliest studies applying large language models to job shop scheduling in dynamic environments, highlighting their considerable potential for intelligent and adaptive scheduling optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI solutions in civil aviation are narrow and disconnected, struggling to integrate diverse data types like voice communications, radar tracks, and sensor streams. This limits situational awareness and decision-making efficiency.

Method: The proposed AviationLMM incorporates a model architecture capable of ingesting multimodal inputs—voice, video, telemetry, text—and performing cross-modal alignment and fusion. Output capabilities include summaries, alerts, diagnostics, and incident reconstructions.

Result: The paper identifies gaps in existing AI systems and highlights key research opportunities such as data alignment, trustworthy AI, robustness, and privacy to build the proposed model.

Conclusion: By presenting design insights and challenges for AviationLMM, the paper aims to progress civil aviation AI research and create a cohesive, trustworthy ecosystem for aviation safety and efficiency.

Abstract: Civil aviation is a cornerstone of global transportation and commerce, and ensuring its safety, efficiency and customer satisfaction is paramount. Yet conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions in aviation remain siloed and narrow, focusing on isolated tasks or single modalities. They struggle to integrate heterogeneous data such as voice communications, radar tracks, sensor streams and textual reports, which limits situational awareness, adaptability, and real-time decision support. This paper introduces the vision of AviationLMM, a Large Multimodal foundation Model for civil aviation, designed to unify the heterogeneous data streams of civil aviation and enable understanding, reasoning, generation and agentic applications. We firstly identify the gaps between existing AI solutions and requirements. Secondly, we describe the model architecture that ingests multimodal inputs such as air-ground voice, surveillance, on-board telemetry, video and structured texts, and performs cross-modal alignment and fusion, and produces flexible outputs ranging from situation summaries and risk alerts to predictive diagnostics and multimodal incident reconstructions. In order to fully realize this vision, we identify key research opportunities to address, including data acquisition, alignment and fusion, pretraining, reasoning, trustworthiness, privacy, robustness to missing modalities, and synthetic scenario generation. By articulating the design and challenges of AviationLMM, we aim to boost the civil aviation foundation model progress and catalyze coordinated research efforts toward an integrated, trustworthy and privacy-preserving aviation AI ecosystem.

TL;DR: The abstract surveys memory mechanisms in large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs, categorizing them into implicit, explicit, and agentic types and exploring their role in enhancing reasoning, adaptability, and personalized inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to understand and organize the evolving implementation of memory mechanisms in LLMs and multi-modal LLMs as they evolve into interactive, continually learning systems.

Method: A comprehensive and structured survey is conducted, categorizing memory into implicit, explicit, and agentic paradigms, and extending the study to multi-modal settings with insights on benchmarks, architectural advances, and challenges.

Result: The survey synthesizes existing literature on memory in LLMs, presenting a taxonomy and discussing frameworks, integration in multi-modal systems, and issues like capacity, alignment, and interoperability.

Conclusion: Memory mechanisms play a crucial role in advancing LLMs and multi-modal systems toward more interactive, adaptive, and coherent performance in diverse tasks and settings.

Abstract: Memory plays a foundational role in augmenting the reasoning, adaptability, and contextual fidelity of modern Large Language Models and Multi-Modal LLMs. As these models transition from static predictors to interactive systems capable of continual learning and personalized inference, the incorporation of memory mechanisms has emerged as a central theme in their architectural and functional evolution. This survey presents a comprehensive and structured synthesis of memory in LLMs and MLLMs, organizing the literature into a cohesive taxonomy comprising implicit, explicit, and agentic memory paradigms. Specifically, the survey delineates three primary memory frameworks. Implicit memory refers to the knowledge embedded within the internal parameters of pre-trained transformers, encompassing their capacity for memorization, associative retrieval, and contextual reasoning. Recent work has explored methods to interpret, manipulate, and reconfigure this latent memory. Explicit memory involves external storage and retrieval components designed to augment model outputs with dynamic, queryable knowledge representations, such as textual corpora, dense vectors, and graph-based structures, thereby enabling scalable and updatable interaction with information sources. Agentic memory introduces persistent, temporally extended memory structures within autonomous agents, facilitating long-term planning, self-consistency, and collaborative behavior in multi-agent systems, with relevance to embodied and interactive AI. Extending beyond text, the survey examines the integration of memory within multi-modal settings, where coherence across vision, language, audio, and action modalities is essential. Key architectural advances, benchmark tasks, and open challenges are discussed, including issues related to memory capacity, alignment, factual consistency, and cross-system interoperability.

*Yiwen Tu,Xuan Liu,Lianhui Qin,Haojian Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces PRA, an AI agent for simulating user-specific privacy concerns based on personal histories and contextual analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in population-level sentiment analysis by creating individualized simulations of privacy concerns responsive to real-world news.

Method: PRA integrates privacy and cognitive theories, reconstructing each user's 'privacy mind,' dynamically using contextual filters, and generating synthetic responses. Results are evaluated with an LLM-based system that judges faithfulness based on privacy taxonomies.

Result: The PRA model successfully predicts privacy concerns and captures reasoning patterns across domains like AI, e-commerce, and healthcare, outperforming baseline models.

Conclusion: PRA provides a more nuanced and effective approach to privacy concern simulation, transferable across multiple domains, highlighting its utility in understanding user-specific privacy reasoning.

Abstract: This paper introduces PRA, an AI-agent design for simulating how individual users form privacy concerns in response to real-world news. Moving beyond population-level sentiment analysis, PRA integrates privacy and cognitive theories to simulate user-specific privacy reasoning grounded in personal comment histories and contextual cues. The agent reconstructs each user's "privacy mind", dynamically activates relevant privacy memory through a contextual filter that emulates bounded rationality, and generates synthetic comments reflecting how that user would likely respond to new privacy scenarios. A complementary LLM-as-a-Judge evaluator, calibrated against an established privacy concern taxonomy, quantifies the faithfulness of generated reasoning. Experiments on real-world Hacker News discussions show that \PRA outperforms baseline agents in privacy concern prediction and captures transferable reasoning patterns across domains including AI, e-commerce, and healthcare.

### [10] [Position on LLM-Assisted Peer Review: Addressing Reviewer Gap through Mentoring and Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09182)
*JungMin Yun,JuneHyoung Kwon,MiHyeon Kim,YoungBin Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques current AI-based review systems and proposes using LLMs as tools to assist and train human reviewers, aiming for sustainable and high-quality peer review.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of sustaining peer review and improving the quality of evaluations amidst the rapid growth of AI research and the Reviewer Gap.

Method: Proposes two systems: an LLM-assisted mentoring system for developing long-term reviewer skills and an LLM-assisted feedback system to improve review quality in real-time.

Result: Systems are designed to enhance human reviewer capabilities rather than replacing them, fostering expertise while ensuring sustainable peer review.

Conclusion: The human-centered approach using LLMs can improve the quality and sustainability of peer review by focusing on reviewer development and feedback refinement.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of AI research has intensified the Reviewer Gap, threatening the peer-review sustainability and perpetuating a cycle of low-quality evaluations. This position paper critiques existing LLM approaches that automatically generate reviews and argues for a paradigm shift that positions LLMs as tools for assisting and educating human reviewers. We define the core principles of high-quality peer review and propose two complementary systems grounded in these foundations: (i) an LLM-assisted mentoring system that cultivates reviewers' long-term competencies, and (ii) an LLM-assisted feedback system that helps reviewers refine the quality of their reviews. This human-centered approach aims to strengthen reviewer expertise and contribute to building a more sustainable scholarly ecosystem.

*Leszek Sliwko,Jolanta Mizeria-Pietraszko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new scheduling system for cluster workload allocation, using Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret user preferences and optimize allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity and usability issues in cluster workload allocation configurations.

Method: Integrates Natural Language Processing with Kubernetes scheduler extender and uses a Large Language Model (LLM) supported by AWS Bedrock to interpret user annotations for scheduling.

Result: Empirical evaluation showed over 95% accuracy for LLM parsing and better or comparable scheduling quality compared to standard configurations in various complex scenarios.

Conclusion: The study validates the use of LLMs for enhancing scheduling accessibility but identifies challenges like synchronous LLM latency, proposing asynchronous strategies for practical implementation.

Abstract: Cluster workload allocation often requires complex configurations, creating a usability gap. This paper introduces a semantic, intent-driven scheduling paradigm for cluster systems using Natural Language Processing. The system employs a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated via a Kubernetes scheduler extender to interpret natural language allocation hint annotations for soft affinity preferences. A prototype featuring a cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (>95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming a baseline engine. Scheduling quality tests across six scenarios showed the prototype achieved superior or equivalent placement compared to standard Kubernetes configurations, particularly excelling in complex and quantitative scenarios and handling conflicting soft preferences. The results validate using LLMs for accessible scheduling but highlight limitations like synchronous LLM latency, suggesting asynchronous processing for production readiness. This work confirms the viability of semantic soft affinity for simplifying workload orchestration.

*Jian Zhang,Zhiyuan Wang,Zhangqi Wang,Yu He,Haoran Luo,li yuan,Lingling Zhang,Rui Mao,Qika Lin,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes MAXS, a reasoning framework for LLM Agents, addressing locally myopic generation and trajectory instability issues by employing lookahead strategies and mechanisms for stable and efficient reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve two major issues in LLM Agent reasoning: locally myopic generation and trajectory instability, which hinder the balance between effectiveness and computational efficiency.

Method: The proposed MAXS framework uses lookahead strategies to estimate the advantage of tool usage and evaluates step consistency and inter-step trend slopes to ensure reasoning stability. It includes a trajectory convergence mechanism to optimize computational costs.

Result: Empirical studies on three LLM systems and five datasets show that MAXS outperforms existing approaches in performance and inference efficiency, validating the expected advantages.

Conclusion: MAXS is effective in resolving reasoning instability and efficiency challenges in LLM Agents, combining accuracy with computational resource management to enhance their practical utility.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents exhibit inherent reasoning abilities through the collaboration of multiple tools. However, during agent inference, existing methods often suffer from (i) locally myopic generation, due to the absence of lookahead, and (ii) trajectory instability, where minor early errors can escalate into divergent reasoning paths. These issues make it difficult to balance global effectiveness and computational efficiency. To address these two issues, we propose meta-adaptive exploration with LLM agents https://github.com/exoskeletonzj/MAXS, a meta-adaptive reasoning framework based on LLM Agents that flexibly integrates tool execution and reasoning planning. MAXS employs a lookahead strategy to extend reasoning paths a few steps ahead, estimating the advantage value of tool usage, and combines step consistency variance and inter-step trend slopes to jointly select stable, consistent, and high-value reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory convergence mechanism that controls computational cost by halting further rollouts once path consistency is achieved, enabling a balance between resource efficiency and global effectiveness in multi-tool reasoning. We conduct extensive empirical studies across three base models (MiMo-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-32B) and five datasets, demonstrating that MAXS consistently outperforms existing methods in both performance and inference efficiency. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of our lookahead strategy and tool usage.

*Yan Liu,Feng Zhang,Zhanyu Ma,Jun Xu,Jiuchong Gao,Jinghua Hao,Renqing He,Han Liu,Yangdong Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoT-Flow introduces a probabilistic approach to reason in large language models, enhancing efficiency and performance in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses inefficiency and optimization challenges in reasoning tasks due to the lack of granular evaluation in current reasoning processes.

Method: CoT-Flow reconceptualizes reasoning as a continuous flow with step-wise contributions, utilizing flow-guided decoding and flow-based reinforcement learning.

Result: CoT-Flow achieves better efficiency and reasoning balance, outperforming benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework systematically quantifies reasoning steps, improving inference and optimization for reasoning tasks.

Abstract: High-quality chain-of-thought has demonstrated strong potential for unlocking the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, current paradigms typically treat the reasoning process as an indivisible sequence, lacking an intrinsic mechanism to quantify step-wise information gain. This granularity gap manifests in two limitations: inference inefficiency from redundant exploration without explicit guidance, and optimization difficulty due to sparse outcome supervision or costly external verifiers. In this work, we propose CoT-Flow, a framework that reconceptualizes discrete reasoning steps as a continuous probabilistic flow, quantifying the contribution of each step toward the ground-truth answer. Built on this formulation, CoT-Flow enables two complementary methodologies: flow-guided decoding, which employs a greedy flow-based decoding strategy to extract information-efficient reasoning paths, and flow-based reinforcement learning, which constructs a verifier-free dense reward function. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that CoT-Flow achieves a superior balance between inference efficiency and reasoning performance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a large language model (LLM) multi-agent framework for proactive and coordinated pandemic policymaking, showing significant improvements in infection and death rates compared to real-world outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fragmented and reactive policymaking during pandemics undermines proactive global mitigation efforts, highlighting the need for coordinated intervention strategies.

Method: An LLM multi-agent framework assigns AI assistants to administrative regions, enabling them to reason based on regional dynamics, communicate inter-regionally, and collaboratively simulate pandemic interventions using real-world data.

Result: Simulations demonstrate up to 63.7% and 40.1% reduction in infections and deaths at state level, and 39.0% and 27.0% reduction respectively across states, compared to real-world COVID-19 outcomes.

Conclusion: LLM multi-agent systems offer a promising tool for enhancing coordinated policymaking during pandemics, enabling more effective intervention strategies and outcomes.

Abstract: Effective pandemic control requires timely and coordinated policymaking across administrative regions that are intrinsically interdependent. However, human-driven responses are often fragmented and reactive, with policies formulated in isolation and adjusted only after outbreaks escalate, undermining proactive intervention and global pandemic mitigation. To address this challenge, here we propose a large language model (LLM) multi-agent policymaking framework that supports coordinated and proactive pandemic control across regions. Within our framework, each administrative region is assigned an LLM agent as an AI policymaking assistant. The agent reasons over region-specific epidemiological dynamics while communicating with other agents to account for cross-regional interdependencies. By integrating real-world data, a pandemic evolution simulator, and structured inter-agent communication, our framework enables agents to jointly explore counterfactual intervention scenarios and synthesize coordinated policy decisions through a closed-loop simulation process. We validate the proposed framework using state-level COVID-19 data from the United States between April and December 2020, together with real-world mobility records and observed policy interventions. Compared with real-world pandemic outcomes, our approach reduces cumulative infections and deaths by up to 63.7% and 40.1%, respectively, at the individual state level, and by 39.0% and 27.0%, respectively, when aggregated across states.

### [15] [RISER: Orchestrating Latent Reasoning Skills for Adaptive Activation Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09269)
*Wencheng Ye,Liang Peng,Xiaoyang Yuan,Yi Bin,Pengpeng Zeng,Hengyu Jin,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents RISER, a framework to improve reasoning in large language models by dynamically steering their activation space, achieving notable accuracy improvements efficiently without parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of static interventions in LLMs during complex reasoning tasks and provide a more adaptive and efficient alternative.

Method: RISER uses reinforcement learning to optimize a lightweight router that dynamically composes reusable reasoning vectors to steer LLMs in activation space.

Result: RISER outperformed baseline models in zero-shot reasoning across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating up to 6.5% accuracy improvement, higher token efficiency, and robust control strategies.

Conclusion: RISER showcases potential for more controllable, efficient reasoning in LLMs by leveraging dynamic and interpretable steering mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent work on domain-specific reasoning with large language models (LLMs) often relies on training-intensive approaches that require parameter updates. While activation steering has emerged as a parameter efficient alternative, existing methods apply static, manual interventions that fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of complex reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose RISER (Router-based Intervention for Steerable Enhancement of Reasoning), a plug-and-play intervention framework that adaptively steers LLM reasoning in activation space. RISER constructs a library of reusable reasoning vectors and employs a lightweight Router to dynamically compose them for each input. The Router is optimized via reinforcement learning under task-level rewards, activating latent cognitive primitives in an emergent and compositional manner. Across seven diverse benchmarks, RISER yields 3.4-6.5% average zero-shot accuracy improvements over the base model while surpassing CoT-style reasoning with 2-3x higher token efficiency and robust accuracy gains. Further analysis shows that RISER autonomously combines multiple vectors into interpretable, precise control strategies, pointing toward more controllable and efficient LLM reasoning.

*Jian Zhang,Yu He,Zhiyuan Wang,Zhangqi Wang,Kai He,Fangzhi Xu,Qika Lin,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces $A^3$-Bench, a benchmark evaluating memory-driven scientific reasoning, focusing on Anchors and Attractors in reasoning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the existing gap in benchmarks, which often ignore the underlying memory-driven mechanisms (anchoring and attraction) crucial for consistent and stable scientific reasoning.

Method: They annotate 2,198 science reasoning problems using the SAPM process and propose a dual-scale memory evaluation framework incorporating the AAUI metric to gauge memory activation.

Result: Experimental validation with various models demonstrates the effectiveness of $A^3$-Bench in analyzing the impact of memory activation on reasoning.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of memory-driven mechanisms in scientific reasoning, offering insights and tools to better evaluate and understand these processes.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning relies not only on logical inference but also on activating prior knowledge and experiential structures. Memory can efficiently reuse knowledge and enhance reasoning consistency and stability. However, existing benchmarks mainly evaluate final answers or step-by-step coherence, overlooking the \textit{memory-driven} mechanisms that underlie human reasoning, which involves activating anchors and attractors, then integrating them into multi-step inference. To address this gap, we propose $A^3$-Bench~ https://a3-bench.github.io, a benchmark designed to evaluate scientific reasoning through dual-scale memory-driven activation, grounded in Anchor and Attractor Activation. First, we annotate 2,198 science reasoning problems across domains using the SAPM process(subject, anchor & attractor, problem, and memory developing). Second, we introduce a dual-scale memory evaluation framework utilizing anchors and attractors, along with the AAUI(Anchor--Attractor Utilization Index) metric to measure memory activation rates. Finally, through experiments with various base models and paradigms, we validate $A^3$-Bench and analyze how memory activation impacts reasoning performance, providing insights into memory-driven scientific reasoning.

*Xiaohan Yu,Chao Feng,Lang Mei,Chong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces M$^3$Searcher, a multimodal information-seeking agent that addresses challenges in multimodal search environments by decoupling information acquisition from answer derivation and optimizing retrieval-oriented learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitation of existing autonomous agents being confined to textual information acquisition and the need to handle multimodal data in complex, multi-step information retrieval scenarios.

Method: The authors propose M$^3$Searcher, a modular framework with a retrieval-oriented multi-objective reward system, and introduce MMSearchVQA, a dataset tailored for multimodal multi-hop retrieval-centric tasks.

Result: M$^3$Searcher achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, showcases adaptability across tasks, and demonstrates effective reasoning in complex multimodal search scenarios.

Conclusion: M$^3$Searcher presents a significant advancement in multimodal autonomous agents, overcoming modality and reasoning challenges through modular design and retrieval-focused optimization.

Abstract: Recent advances in DeepResearch-style agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in autonomous information acquisition and synthesize from real-world web environments. However, existing approaches remain fundamentally limited to text modality. Extending autonomous information-seeking agents to multimodal settings introduces critical challenges: the specialization-generalization trade-off that emerges when training models for multimodal tool-use at scale, and the severe scarcity of training data capturing complex, multi-step multimodal search trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose M$^3$Searcher, a modular multimodal information-seeking agent that explicitly decouples information acquisition from answer derivation. M$^3$Searcher is optimized with a retrieval-oriented multi-objective reward that jointly encourages factual accuracy, reasoning soundness, and retrieval fidelity. In addition, we develop MMSearchVQA, a multimodal multi-hop dataset to support retrieval centric RL training. Experimental results demonstrate that M$^3$Searcher outperforms existing approaches, exhibits strong transfer adaptability and effective reasoning in complex multimodal tasks.

### [18] [STaR: Sensitive Trajectory Regulation for Unlearning in Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09281)
*Jingjing Zhou,Gaoxiang Cong,Li Su,Liang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a framework for privacy protection in large reasoning models (LRMs), addressing the limitations of existing unlearning methods by safeguarding both final answers and intermediate reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unlearning techniques for large reasoning models primarily focus on final answers, neglecting the privacy risks embedded in intermediate reasoning steps, thus failing to ensure comprehensive privacy protection.

Method: The STaR framework involves semantic-aware detection of sensitive content, secure constraint injection, trajectory-aware suppression of privacy risks, and adaptive filtering against sensitive tokens during inference, along with two new evaluation metrics for effective assessment.

Result: STaR demonstrates significant advancement in privacy protection across the reasoning process with minimal loss of model utility, as shown in experiments on the R-TOFU benchmark.

Conclusion: STaR sets a new benchmark for ensuring robust privacy protection in LRMs, mitigating privacy concerns while maintaining reasoning quality.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have advanced automated multi-step reasoning, but their ability to generate complex Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectories introduces severe privacy risks, as sensitive information may be deeply embedded throughout the reasoning process. Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels. Experiments on the R-TOFU benchmark demonstrate that STaR achieves comprehensive and stable unlearning with minimal utility loss, setting a new standard for privacy-preserving reasoning in LRMs.

### [19] [Policy-Based Reinforcement Learning with Action Masking for Dynamic Job Shop Scheduling under Uncertainty: Handling Random Arrivals and Machine Failures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09293)
*Sofiene Lassoued,Stefan Lier,Andreas Schwung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework utilizing Coloured Timed Petri Nets and Maskable Proximal Policy Optimization to address dynamic job shop scheduling with uncertainties like stochastic job arrivals and machine breakdowns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address challenges in dynamic job shop scheduling caused by stochastic job arrivals and unexpected machine breakdowns, with a focus on creating a robust solution adaptable to real-world industrial scenarios.

Method: The framework employs Coloured Timed Petri Nets to model the scheduling environment and Maskable Proximal Policy Optimization to make dynamic decisions. It uses stochastic modeling (Gamma and Weibull distributions) to simulate job arrivals and machine failures.

Result: The framework outperforms traditional heuristic and rule-based approaches in benchmarks, improving makespan minimization in dynamic and uncertain manufacturing conditions.

Conclusion: The integration of Petri-net-based models and adaptive reinforcement learning produces a resilient and interpretable framework, offering scalability and real-time adaptability in uncertain manufacturing settings.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for solving Dynamic Job Shop Scheduling Problems under uncertainty, addressing the challenges introduced by stochastic job arrivals and unexpected machine breakdowns. Our approach follows a model-based paradigm, using Coloured Timed Petri Nets to represent the scheduling environment, and Maskable Proximal Policy Optimization to enable dynamic decision-making while restricting the agent to feasible actions at each decision point. To simulate realistic industrial conditions, dynamic job arrivals are modeled using a Gamma distribution, which captures complex temporal patterns such as bursts, clustering, and fluctuating workloads. Machine failures are modeled using a Weibull distribution to represent age-dependent degradation and wear-out dynamics. These stochastic models enable the framework to reflect real-world manufacturing scenarios better. In addition, we study two action-masking strategies: a non-gradient approach that overrides the probabilities of invalid actions, and a gradient-based approach that assigns negative gradients to invalid actions within the policy network. We conduct extensive experiments on dynamic JSSP benchmarks, demonstrating that our method consistently outperforms traditional heuristic and rule-based approaches in terms of makespan minimization. The results highlight the strength of combining interpretable Petri-net-based models with adaptive reinforcement learning policies, yielding a resilient, scalable, and explainable framework for real-time scheduling in dynamic and uncertain manufacturing environments.

*Ioannis Peridis,Dimitrios Troullinos,Georgios Chalkiadakis,Pantelis Giankoulidis,Ioannis Papamichail,Markos Papageorgiou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Researchers explore autonomous driving in lane-free traffic using Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided by pre-trained neural networks, optimizing safety and efficacy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome traditional lane constraints in traffic and develop autonomous driving strategies suitable for lane-free environments, allowing better road capacity utilization.

Method: Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) combined with pre-trained neural networks was used to guide single-agent decisions, incorporating predictive abilities under computational limits.

Result: Experimental evaluation showed safety improvements, vehicle behavior adjustments (nudging due to faster tailing cars), enhanced performance when guided by neural networks, and computational-efficiency trade-offs.

Conclusion: The approach presents promising results in lane-free traffic, highlighting improvements in traffic flow, safety, and computational efficiency with NN-guided planning.

Abstract: Lane-free traffic environments allow vehicles to better harness the lateral capacity of the road without being restricted to lane-keeping, thereby increasing the traffic flow rates. As such, we have a distinct and more challenging setting for autonomous driving. In this work, we consider a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning approach for single-agent autonomous driving in lane-free traffic, where the associated Markov Decision Process we formulate is influenced from existing approaches tied to reinforcement learning frameworks. In addition, MCTS is equipped with a pre-trained neural network (NN) that guides the selection phase. This procedure incorporates the predictive capabilities of NNs for a more informed tree search process under computational constraints. In our experimental evaluation, we consider metrics that address both safety (through collision rates) and efficacy (through measured speed). Then, we examine: (a) the influence of isotropic state information for vehicles in a lane-free environment, resulting in nudging behaviour--vehicles' policy reacts due to the presence of faster tailing ones, (b) the acceleration of performance for the NN-guided variant of MCTS, and (c) the trade-off between computational resources and solution quality.

*Qinglong Shi,Donghai Wang,Hantao Zhou,Jiguo Li,Jun Xu,Jiuchong Gao,Jinghua Hao,Renqing He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new interaction paradigm for Task-oriented Agents to address limitations in long-term intent maintenance by proposing proactivity features and a benchmark tool, with effective results shown through synthetic data modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models fail to dynamically adapt to long-term user needs and evolving environments, necessitating solutions for proactive agent interaction.

Method: The paper formalizes proactivity via Intent-Conditioned Monitoring and Event-Triggered Follow-up, introduces a synthetic data pipeline for complex dialogue scenarios, and evaluates with a new benchmark ChronosBench.

Result: Fine-tuned models trained on synthetic data achieved a task completion rate of 85.19%, outperforming other tested models, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: Proactive agents and data-driven strategies are effective for enhancing long-term, task-oriented interaction within dynamic environments.

Abstract: Current large language model agents predominantly operate under a reactive paradigm, responding only to immediate user queries within short-term sessions. This limitation hinders their ability to maintain long-term user's intents and dynamically adapt to evolving external environments. In this paper, we propose a novel interaction paradigm for proactive Task-oriented Agents capable of bridging the gap between relatively static user's needs and a dynamic environment. We formalize proactivity through two key capabilities, (i) Intent-Conditioned Monitoring: The agent autonomously formulates trigger conditions based on dialog history; (ii) Event-Triggered Follow-up: The agent actively engages the user upon detecting useful environmental updates. We introduce a high-quality data synthesis pipeline to construct complex, multi-turn dialog data in a dynamic environment. Furthermore, we attempt to address the lack of evaluation criteria of task-oriented interaction in a dynamic environment by proposing a new benchmark, namely ChronosBench. We evaluated some leading close-source and open-source models at present and revealed their flaws in long-term task-oriented interaction. Furthermore, our fine-tuned model trained using synthetic data for supervised learning achieves a task completion rate of 85.19% for complex tasks including shifts in user intent, outperforming other models under test. And the result validated the effectiveness of our data-driven strategy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EvoFSM introduces a structured self-evolving framework for LLM-based agents using Finite State Machines (FSM) to improve adaptability and control while addressing issues in open-ended queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of fixed workflows and unconstrained self-evolution in LLMs that lead to instability and errors.

Method: Introduces EvoFSM, which splits optimization into Flow (state-transition logic) and Skill (state-specific behaviors) using constrained FSM evolution guided by a critic mechanism. It also includes a self-evolving memory for learning from both successes and failures.

Result: EvoFSM achieved 58.0% accuracy on the DeepSearch benchmark and demonstrated its effectiveness across five multi-hop QA benchmarks and interactive decision-making tasks.

Conclusion: EvoFSM balances adaptability and control in LLM-based agents, offering improved problem-solving ability and better generalization through structured evolution.

Abstract: While LLM-based agents have shown promise for deep research, most existing approaches rely on fixed workflows that struggle to adapt to real-world, open-ended queries. Recent work therefore explores self-evolution by allowing agents to rewrite their own code or prompts to improve problem-solving ability, but unconstrained optimization often triggers instability, hallucinations, and instruction drift. We propose EvoFSM, a structured self-evolving framework that achieves both adaptability and control by evolving an explicit Finite State Machine (FSM) instead of relying on free-form rewriting. EvoFSM decouples the optimization space into macroscopic Flow (state-transition logic) and microscopic Skill (state-specific behaviors), enabling targeted improvements under clear behavioral boundaries. Guided by a critic mechanism, EvoFSM refines the FSM through a small set of constrained operations, and further incorporates a self-evolving memory that distills successful trajectories as reusable priors and failure patterns as constraints for future queries. Extensive evaluations on five multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EvoFSM. In particular, EvoFSM reaches 58.0% accuracy on the DeepSearch benchmark. Additional results on interactive decision-making tasks further validate its generalization.

*Siyuan Liu,Hongbang Yuan,Xinze Li,Ziyue Zhu,Yixin Cao,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Task-to-Quiz' (T2Q), a new evaluation paradigm for testing LLM agents' understanding of their environment, and finds current memory mechanisms insufficient for grounded environment understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the issue of evaluating LLM agents not only on task success but also on their ability to generalize and understand varying environments.

Method: The authors propose Task-to-Quiz (T2Q), an automated paradigm that uses deterministic grounded QA pairs to evaluate agents' understanding, decoupled from task execution. They also developed 'T2QBench,' which includes 30 environments and 1,967 QA pairs.

Result: Experiments on T2QBench reveal that task success does not reliably indicate environment understanding, and current memory mechanisms fail to produce grounded models of environments.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for better methods like proactive exploration and fine-grained state representation for developing generalizable autonomous agents.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex decision-making and tool-use tasks, yet their ability to generalize across varying environments remains a under-examined concern. Current evaluation paradigms predominantly rely on trajectory-based metrics that measure task success, while failing to assess whether agents possess a grounded, transferable model of the environment. To address this gap, we propose Task-to-Quiz (T2Q), a deterministic and automated evaluation paradigm designed to decouple task execution from world-state understanding. We instantiate this paradigm in T2QBench, a suite comprising 30 environments and 1,967 grounded QA pairs across multiple difficulty levels. Our extensive experiments reveal that task success is often a poor proxy for environment understanding, and that current memory machanism can not effectively help agents acquire a grounded model of the environment. These findings identify proactive exploration and fine-grained state representation as primary bottlenecks, offering a robust foundation for developing more generalizable autonomous agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in multimodal reasoning by proposing a new unified generative reasoning approach that generates intermediate images. The framework achieves broad success in multimodal tasks, even without multimodal annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome task-specific limitations in current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and enable generalizable, diverse reasoning skills across various multimodal tasks.

Method: The authors propose 'unified generative multimodal reasoning,' implemented through Omni-R1, a two-stage framework combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) with perception alignment loss and reward to generate intermediate images. They also develop Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the reliance on multimodal data by utilizing text-based learning.

Result: The proposed Omni-R1 framework achieved effective unified reasoning across many multimodal tasks, while Omni-R1-Zero demonstrated the ability to match or even outperform Omni-R1 without multimodal annotations.

Conclusion: The research highlights the potential of generative multimodal reasoning for handling diverse tasks more effectively and showcases a promising step towards greater scalability and generalization in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are making significant progress in multimodal reasoning. Early approaches focus on pure text-based reasoning. More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow a single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on a specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, a two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data. Empirical results show that Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across a wide range of multimodal tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero can match or even surpass Omni-R1 on average, suggesting a promising direction for generative multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: LEAN-LLM-OPT automates large-scale optimization modeling using a lightweight framework involving multiple LLM agents. It simplifies the formulation process and achieves competitive performance in real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building optimization models is often labor-intensive and time-consuming, motivating the need for an automated framework assisted by generative LLMs.

Method: The framework uses upstream LLM agents to dynamically design workflows and a downstream LLM agent to produce optimization formulations. Auxiliary tools handle mechanical data operations.

Result: LEAN-LLM-OPT achieves strong performance in simulations and practical applications, such as revenue management for Singapore Airlines. It also introduces benchmarks for optimization auto-formulation.

Conclusion: This framework simplifies optimization modeling and demonstrates competitive, practical value, solving industry-level problems effectively.

Abstract: Large-scale optimization is a key backbone of modern business decision-making. However, building these models is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. We address this by proposing LEAN-LLM-OPT, a LightwEight AgeNtic workflow construction framework for LLM-assisted large-scale OPTimization auto-formulation. LEAN-LLM-OPT takes as input a problem description together with associated datasets and orchestrates a team of LLM agents to produce an optimization formulation. Specifically, upon receiving a query, two upstream LLM agents dynamically construct a workflow that specifies, step-by-step, how optimization models for similar problems can be formulated. A downstream LLM agent then follows this workflow to generate the final output. Leveraging LLMs' text-processing capabilities and common modeling practices, the workflow decomposes the modeling task into a sequence of structured sub-tasks and offloads mechanical data-handling operations to auxiliary tools. This design alleviates the downstream agent's burden related to planning and data handling, allowing it to focus on the most challenging components that cannot be readily standardized. Extensive simulations show that LEAN-LLM-OPT, instantiated with GPT-4.1 and the open source gpt-oss-20B, achieves strong performance on large-scale optimization modeling tasks and is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, in a Singapore Airlines choice-based revenue management use case, LEAN-LLM-OPT demonstrates practical value by achieving leading performance across a range of scenarios. Along the way, we introduce Large-Scale-OR and Air-NRM, the first comprehensive benchmarks for large-scale optimization auto-formulation. The code and data of this work is available at https://github.com/CoraLiang01/lean-llm-opt.

TL;DR: The study introduces a task and benchmark for personalized GUI agents to handle vague user instructions and provide assistance by leveraging long-term user records. A new agent, HIM-Agent, demonstrates improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop GUI agents that understand and execute complex implicit user intents by leveraging long-term user records effectively, improving user alignment and proactive assistance.

Method: The authors introduce the AndroidIntent benchmark with annotated user preferences and routines, and propose the HIM-Agent, which uses a hierarchical personal memory framework for understanding user intent.

Result: HIM-Agent outperforms existing GUI agents on the benchmark, achieving significant improvements in execution (15.7%) and proactive performance (7.3%).

Conclusion: PersonalAlign and HIM-Agent successfully address implicit intent alignment in personalized GUI agents, advancing the field with a new evaluation benchmark and improved agent capabilities.

Abstract: While GUI agents have shown strong performance under explicit and completion instructions, real-world deployment requires aligning with users' more complex implicit intents. In this work, we highlight Hierarchical Implicit Intent Alignment for Personalized GUI Agent (PersonalAlign), a new agent task that requires agents to leverage long-term user records as persistent context to resolve omitted preferences in vague instructions and anticipate latent routines by user state for proactive assistance. To facilitate this study, we introduce AndroidIntent, a benchmark designed to evaluate agents' ability in resolving vague instructions and providing proactive suggestions through reasoning over long-term user records. We annotated 775 user-specific preferences and 215 routines from 20k long-term records across different users for evaluation. Furthermore, we introduce Hierarchical Intent Memory Agent (HIM-Agent), which maintains a continuously updating personal memory and hierarchically organizes user preferences and routines for personalization. Finally, we evaluate a range of GUI agents on AndroidIntent, including GPT-5, Qwen3-VL, and UI-TARS, further results show that HIM-Agent significantly improves both execution and proactive performance by 15.7% and 7.3%.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MATTRL, a framework that uses test-time reinforcement learning for multi-agent teams to improve decision-making and performance in diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies and instability in multi-agent RL, caused by co-adaptation, non-stationarity, and rewards that suffer from sparsity and high variance.

Method: The MATTRL framework introduces structured textual experience into multi-agent test-time deliberation, forms multi-expert teams for discussions, retrieves test-time experiences, and achieves consensus for decision-making. It also incorporates credit assignment for creating and reintegrating experience pools.

Result: MATTRL demonstrated an average accuracy improvement of 3.67% over multi-agent baselines and 8.67% over single-agent baselines across domains like medicine, math, and education.

Conclusion: MATTRL provides a stable, efficient, and effective approach to enhance multi-agent reasoning under distribution shifts, without requiring tuning.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems have evolved into practical LLM-driven collaborators for many applications, gaining robustness from diversity and cross-checking. However, multi-agent RL (MARL) training is resource-intensive and unstable: co-adapting teammates induce non-stationarity, and rewards are often sparse and high-variance. Therefore, we introduce \textbf{Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL)}, a framework that injects structured textual experience into multi-agent deliberation at inference time. MATTRL forms a multi-expert team of specialists for multi-turn discussions, retrieves and integrates test-time experiences, and reaches consensus for final decision-making. We also study credit assignment for constructing a turn-level experience pool, then reinjecting it into the dialogue. Across challenging benchmarks in medicine, math, and education, MATTRL improves accuracy by an average of 3.67\% over a multi-agent baseline, and by 8.67\% over comparable single-agent baselines. Ablation studies examine different credit-assignment schemes and provide a detailed comparison of how they affect training outcomes. MATTRL offers a stable, effective and efficient path to distribution-shift-robust multi-agent reasoning without tuning.

TL;DR: The paper presents an AI framework for proactively managing supply chain disruptions by utilizing specialized agents powered by large language models and deterministic tools to analyze, monitor, and respond to such disruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of visibility in supply chains beyond Tier-1 suppliers and to foster proactive resilience against disruptions originating in deeper tiers of supply networks.

Method: The authors propose a minimally supervised agentic AI framework consisting of seven specialized agents that use large language models and deterministic tools to detect disruption signals, map supplier networks, evaluate exposure, and recommend mitigation strategies.

Result: The framework demonstrates high accuracy (F1 scores 0.962–0.991) and performs rapid end-to-end analyses (3.83 minutes per disruption at a cost of $0.0836). A case study on the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict validates its operational applicability.

Conclusion: This framework marks a significant advancement toward resilient, autonomous supply chains capable of proactively managing disruptions across multi-tier networks.

Abstract: Modern supply chains are increasingly exposed to disruptions from geopolitical events, demand shocks, trade restrictions, to natural disasters. While many of these disruptions originate deep in the supply network, most companies still lack visibility beyond Tier-1 suppliers, leaving upstream vulnerabilities undetected until the impact cascades downstream. To overcome this blind-spot and move from reactive recovery to proactive resilience, we introduce a minimally supervised agentic AI framework that autonomously monitors, analyses, and responds to disruptions across extended supply networks. The architecture comprises seven specialised agents powered by large language models and deterministic tools that jointly detect disruption signals from unstructured news, map them to multi-tier supplier networks, evaluate exposure based on network structure, and recommend mitigations such as alternative sourcing options. \rev{We evaluate the framework across 30 synthesised scenarios covering three automotive manufacturers and five disruption classes. The system achieves high accuracy across core tasks, with F1 scores between 0.962 and 0.991, and performs full end-to-end analyses in a mean of 3.83 minutes at a cost of \$0.0836 per disruption. Relative to industry benchmarks of multi-day, analyst-driven assessments, this represents a reduction of more than three orders of magnitude in response time. A real-world case study of the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict further demonstrates operational applicability. This work establishes a foundational step toward building resilient, proactive, and autonomous supply chains capable of managing disruptions across deep-tier networks.

Abstract: Processing in Memory (PIM) and similar terms such as Compute In Memory (CIM), Logic in Memory (LIM), In Memory Computing (IMC), and Near Memory Computing (NMC) have gained attention recently as a potentially ``revolutionary new'' technique. The truth, however, is that many examples of the technology go back over 60 years. This document attempts to provide an annotated bibliography of PIM technology that attempts to cover the whole time-frame, and is organized to augment a forth-coming article.

### [30] [DeliberationBench: When Do More Voices Hurt? A Controlled Study of Multi-LLM Deliberation Protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08835)
*Vaarunay Kaushal,Taranveer Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces DELIBERATIONBENCH to benchmark multi-agent Large Language Models (LLMs) deliberation versus simpler selection methods. Results reveal that simpler methods significantly outperform deliberative protocols in accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the practical value and effectiveness of multi-agent LLM deliberation protocols compared to simpler approaches.

Method: The paper develops a benchmark, DELIBERATIONBENCH, to assess three deliberation protocols against a baseline method of selecting the best response from model outputs, across 270 questions and independent seeds.

Result: The best-single response baseline achieves a win rate of 82.5%, while the best deliberation protocol achieves only 13.8%, with deliberation being 1.5-2.5x more computationally expensive.

Conclusion: Complexity in multi-LLM deliberation systems does not necessarily enhance performance, as simpler methods exhibit better outcomes with lower computational costs.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems where Large Language Models (LLMs) deliberate to form consensus have gained significant attention, yet their practical value over simpler methods remains under-scrutinized. We introduce DELIBERATIONBENCH, a controlled benchmark evaluating three deliberation protocols against a strong baseline of selecting the best response from a pool of model outputs. Across 270 questions and three independent seeds (810 total evaluations), we find a striking negative result: the best-single baseline achieves an 82.5% +- 3.3% win rate, dramatically outperforming the best deliberation protocol(13.8% +- 2.6%). This 6.0x performance gap is statistically significant (p < 0.01) and comes at 1.5-2.5x higher computational cost. Our findings challenge assumptions that complexity enhances quality in multi-LLM systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study reviews the intersection of PTSD and chronic illnesses, analyzing social media data to derive insights into management and challenges, using NLP and ML methods with accuracy rates between 74% and 90%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how PTSD manifests and is managed in individuals with chronic medical conditions, especially through online expressions on social media platforms.

Method: Systematic review of literature from 2008 to 2024, with analysis using NLP and ML tools to identify PTSD cases and explore social media's role in shaping coping strategies and early interventions.

Result: Social media data provides insights into the challenges faced by individuals with PTSD and chronic illnesses, with NLP/ML achieving detection accuracy rates of 74%-90%. Online communities also play a significant role in coping and early intervention.

Conclusion: PTSD research and treatment should integrate considerations of chronic illnesses. Social media offers a powerful tool for monitoring and supporting vulnerable groups, while targeted interventions should be developed to aid these populations.

Abstract: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a multifaceted mental health condition, particularly challenging for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions. This review critically examines the intersection of PTSD and chronic illnesses as expressed on social media platforms. By systematically analyzing literature from 2008 to 2024, the study explores how PTSD manifests and is managed in individuals with chronic conditions such as cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune disorders, with a focus on online expressions on platforms like X (formally known as Twitter) and Facebook. Findings demonstrate that social media data offers valuable insights into the unique challenges faced by individuals with both PTSD and chronic illnesses. Specifically, natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques can identify potential PTSD cases among these populations, achieving accuracy rates between 74% and 90%. Furthermore, the role of online support communities in shaping coping strategies and facilitating early interventions is highlighted. This review underscores the necessity of incorporating considerations of pre-existing medical conditions in PTSD research and treatment, emphasizing social media's potential as a monitoring and support tool for vulnerable groups. Future research directions and clinical implications are also discussed, with an emphasis on developing targeted interventions.

### [32] [From Adversarial Poetry to Adversarial Tales: An Interpretability Research Agenda](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08837)
*Piercosma Bisconti,Marcello Galisai,Matteo Prandi,Federico Pierucci,Olga Sorokoletova,Francesco Giarrusso,Vincenzo Suriani,Marcantonio Brancale,Daniele Nardi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adversarial Tales, a technique exploiting cultural structures and narratives to bypass safety mechanisms in large language models (LLMs), achieving high attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses vulnerabilities in safety designs of LLMs, focusing on culturally coded narratives that cleverly subvert harmful content safeguards.

Method: Adversarial Tales embeds harmful content in cyberpunk narratives, leveraging Vladimir Propp's folktale morphology for attack frameworks. This involves structural decomposition techniques to bypass safety filters.

Result: Through testing on 26 models from nine providers, the methods achieved a 71.3% average success rate, showing no reliable robustness across model families.

Conclusion: Structurally-grounded jailbreaks present a pervasive threat to LLMs and cannot be mitigated through pattern-matching measures alone. Further research on mechanistic interpretability is necessary to counter vulnerabilities tied to narrative cues.

Abstract: Safety mechanisms in LLMs remain vulnerable to attacks that reframe harmful requests through culturally coded structures. We introduce Adversarial Tales, a jailbreak technique that embeds harmful content within cyberpunk narratives and prompts models to perform functional analysis inspired by Vladimir Propp's morphology of folktales. By casting the task as structural decomposition, the attack induces models to reconstruct harmful procedures as legitimate narrative interpretation. Across 26 frontier models from nine providers, we observe an average attack success rate of 71.3%, with no model family proving reliably robust. Together with our prior work on Adversarial Poetry, these findings suggest that structurally-grounded jailbreaks constitute a broad vulnerability class rather than isolated techniques. The space of culturally coded frames that can mediate harmful intent is vast, likely inexhaustible by pattern-matching defenses alone. Understanding why these attacks succeed is therefore essential: we outline a mechanistic interpretability research agenda to investigate how narrative cues reshape model representations and whether models can learn to recognize harmful intent independently of surface form.

### [33] [Companion Agents: A Table-Information Mining Paradigm for Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08838)
*Jiahui Chen,Lei Fu,Jian Cui,Yu Lei,Zhenning Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Companion Agents (CA), a paradigm that improves Text-to-SQL accuracy under scenarios lacking annotations, by proactively mining and consolidating database-side evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-SQL benchmarks assume perfect database annotations and complete external knowledge, which does not reflect typical industrial scenarios with missing or incorrect annotations.

Method: A database-centric approach using Companion Agents (CA), which proactively extracts and caches query-relevant knowledge from databases before query generation.

Result: CA recovers significant execution accuracy improvement on the BIRD benchmarks (e.g., +14.13 accuracy on DAIL-SQL), especially under scenarios with missing evidence.

Conclusion: CA offers a practical solution for deploying Text-to-SQL systems in real-world settings without relying on human-curated evidence, demonstrating its effectiveness in annotation-scarce environments.

Abstract: Large-scale Text-to-SQL benchmarks such as BIRD typically assume complete and accurate database annotations as well as readily available external knowledge, which fails to reflect common industrial settings where annotations are missing, incomplete, or erroneous. This mismatch substantially limits the real-world applicability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) Text-to-SQL systems. To bridge this gap, we explore a database-centric approach that leverages intrinsic, fine-grained information residing in relational databases to construct missing evidence and improve Text-to-SQL accuracy under annotation-scarce conditions. Our key hypothesis is that when a query requires multi-step reasoning over extensive table information, existing methods often struggle to reliably identify and utilize the truly relevant knowledge. We therefore propose to "cache" query-relevant knowledge on the database side in advance, so that it can be selectively activated at inference time. Based on this idea, we introduce Companion Agents (CA), a new Text-to-SQL paradigm that incorporates a group of agents accompanying database schemas to proactively mine and consolidate hidden inter-table relations, value-domain distributions, statistical regularities, and latent semantic cues before query generation. Experiments on BIRD under the fully missing evidence setting show that CA recovers +4.49 / +4.37 / +14.13 execution accuracy points on RSL-SQL / CHESS / DAIL-SQL, respectively, with larger gains on the Challenging subset +9.65 / +7.58 / +16.71. These improvements stem from CA's automatic database-side mining and evidence construction, suggesting a practical path toward industrial-grade Text-to-SQL deployment without reliance on human-curated evidence.

### [34] [Recursive Knowledge Synthesis for Multi-LLM Systems: Stability Analysis and Tri-Agent Audit Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08839)
*Toshiyuki Shigemura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a tri-agent framework for improved stability and explainability in multi-model large language systems using Recursive Knowledge Synthesis (RKS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a reliable and transparent multi-model large language system capable of stable and explainable knowledge synthesis in real-world conditions.

Method: The framework uses three heterogeneous LLMs for semantic generation, consistency checking, and transparency auditing in a recursive interaction cycle evaluated via metrics such as Reflex Reliability Score and Transparency Score.

Result: The system achieves stability with high reliability and transparency (mean RRS=0.78, TS>=0.8 in 68% trials, and ~89% trial convergence).

Conclusion: This tri-agent framework demonstrates the feasibility of safety-preserving, human-supervised recursive knowledge synthesis in realistic LLM applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a tri-agent cross-validation framework for analyzing stability and explainability in multi-model large language systems. The architecture integrates three heterogeneous LLMs-used for semantic generation, analytical consistency checking, and transparency auditing-into a recursive interaction cycle. This design induces Recursive Knowledge Synthesis (RKS), where intermediate representations are continuously refined through mutually constraining transformations irreducible to single-model behavior. Across 47 controlled trials using public-access LLM deployments (October 2025), we evaluated system stability via four metrics: Reflex Reliability Score (RRS), Transparency Score (TS), Deviation Detection Rate (DDR), and Correction Success Rate (CSR). The system achieved mean RRS = 0.78+-0.06 and maintained TS >= 0.8 in about 68% of trials. Approximately 89% of trials converged, supporting the theoretical prediction that transparency auditing acts as a contraction operator within the composite validation mapping. The contributions are threefold: (1) a structured tri-agent framework for coordinated reasoning across heterogeneous LLMs, (2) a formal RKS model grounded in fixed-point theory, and (3) empirical evaluation of inter-model stability under realistic, non-API public-access conditions. These results provide initial empirical evidence that a safety-preserving, humansupervised multi-LLM architecture can achieve stable recursive knowledge synthesis in realistic, publicly deployed environments.

### [35] [Consistency-Aware Editing for Entity-level Unlearning in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08840)
*Xiaoqi Han,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Ru Li,Xiaoli Li,Jiye Liang,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces consistency-aware editing (CAE), a framework designed for efficient entity-level unlearning in large language models (LLMs), surpassing traditional unlearning methods in accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensitive, harmful, or copyrighted information in LLMs necessitates effective methods to remove all knowledge of particular entities while maintaining overall model performance.

Method: The CAE framework aggregates diverse prompts about a target entity and learns low-rank updates guided by consistency regularization to robustly and comprehensively delete the entity's information without interfering with unrelated knowledge.

Result: CAE significantly improves accuracy and robustness in entity-level unlearning compared to traditional methods, as evaluated on benchmarks RWKU and ToFU, and demonstrates scalable entity removal requiring only tens of prompts.

Conclusion: Consistency-aware editing proves effective for entity-level unlearning, offering insights into LLM knowledge representation and a scalable approach to efficiently remove sensitive entity knowledge.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) risk retaining sensitive, copyrighted, or harmful information from their training data. Entity-level unlearning addresses this issue by removing all knowledge of a specific entity while preserving the model's overall capabilities. Existing approaches typically rely on full-model fine-tuning or prompt-based interventions, which can be computationally expensive or brittle when handling paraphrased queries. Recently, model editing has emerged as an efficient alternative for updating knowledge in LLMs, offering a promising direction for unlearning. However, existing editing techniques are typically designed for instance-level updates, modifying responses to specific attributes of an entity rather than eliminating all knowledge associated with the entity. In this paper, we investigate how editing techniques can be adapted for effective and efficient entity-level unlearning. To this end, we introduce a novel consistency-aware editing (CAE) framework. CAE aggregates a diverse set of prompts related to a target entity, including its attributes, relations, and adversarial paraphrases. It then jointly learns a low-rank update guided by a consistency regularizer that aligns the editing directions across prompts. This promotes robust and comprehensive forgetting while minimizing interference with unrelated knowledge. We further examine where different entities are stored within the model and how many diverse prompts are needed for successful unlearning. We evaluate CAE on two challenging benchmarks, RWKU and ToFU, and demonstrate that it (i) provides insights into how entity-level knowledge is internally represented and deleted in LLMs, (ii) significantly improves forgetting accuracy and robustness over traditional unlearning and editing baselines, and (iii) enables scalable entity removal using only tens of carefully selected prompts.

### [36] [Triples and Knowledge-Infused Embeddings for Clustering and Classification of Scientific Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08841)
*Mihael Arcan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores methods to improve the clustering and classification of scientific papers by incorporating structured knowledge like triples, achieving 92.6% accuracy in classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge posed by the growing volume and complexity of scientific literature, necessitating better organizing and understanding techniques.

Method: A modular pipeline combining unsupervised clustering and supervised classification is proposed. Different document representations (abstracts, triples, and hybrids) are embedded using transformer models (MiniLM, MPNet, SciBERT, SPECTER) for clustering (KMeans, GMM, HDBSCAN) and classification tasks.

Result: Hybrid representations that blend abstracts and triples significantly improve classification performance (92.6% accuracy). MiniLM and MPNet outperform domain-specific models in clustering, but SciBERT excels in structured-input classification.

Conclusion: Structured knowledge improves classification accuracy, and integrating unstructured and structured data offers complementary benefits for organizing scientific literature effectively.

Abstract: The increasing volume and complexity of scientific literature demand robust methods for organizing and understanding research documents. In this study, we explore how structured knowledge, specifically, subject-predicate-object triples, can enhance the clustering and classification of scientific papers. We propose a modular pipeline that combines unsupervised clustering and supervised classification over multiple document representations: raw abstracts, extracted triples, and hybrid formats that integrate both. Using a filtered arXiv corpus, we extract relational triples from abstracts and construct four text representations, which we embed using four state-of-the-art transformer models: MiniLM, MPNet, SciBERT, and SPECTER. We evaluate the resulting embeddings with KMeans, GMM, and HDBSCAN for unsupervised clustering, and fine-tune classification models for arXiv subject prediction. Our results show that full abstract text yields the most coherent clusters, but that hybrid representations incorporating triples consistently improve classification performance, reaching up to 92.6% accuracy and 0.925 macro-F1. We also find that lightweight sentence encoders (MiniLM, MPNet) outperform domain-specific models (SciBERT, SPECTER) in clustering, while SciBERT excels in structured-input classification. These findings highlight the complementary benefits of combining unstructured text with structured knowledge, offering new insights into knowledge-infused representations for semantic organization of scientific documents.

### [37] [Resisting Correction: How RLHF Makes Language Models Ignore External Safety Signals in Natural Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08842)
*Felipe Biava Cataneo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines how instruction-tuned language models like Llama-3.2-3B handle external confidence signals in different interaction modes, finding challenges in natural conversational contexts compared to explicit prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates whether instruction-tuned language models can integrate external confidence signals during interactive dialogues, ensuring safe and adaptable responses under varying interaction styles.

Method: Using Llama-3.2-3B on GSM8K dataset, causal intervention tests were conducted, measuring model behavior in response to external corrections under different prompt strategies.

Result: Base models demonstrated high controllability, while instruction-tuned models showed reduced compliance with external signals in conversational interactions due to prioritizing fluency over calibration.

Conclusion: Safety-critical deployment issues arise in conversational interactions where instruction-tuned models are less effective in integrating external corrections, highlighting limitations of RLHF optimization.

Abstract: Safety architectures for language models increasingly rely on external monitors to detect errors and inject corrective signals at inference time. For such systems to function in interactive settings, models must be able to incorporate externally provided confidence information into their verbal responses. In this work, we test whether instruction-tuned language models preserve this controllability across different interaction modes.
  Using Llama-3.2-3B on GSM8K, we perform a causal intervention study in which explicit external confidence signals are injected and model compliance is measured under multiple prompt strategies. We find that base models exhibit near-perfect controllability (Spearman rho close to 1.0), while instruction-tuned models display a striking context dependence: they fully comply with external corrections under explicit command prompts (bias approximately 0 percent, rho = 0.93), yet systematically ignore the same signals in natural conversational queries (bias plus 40 percent, rho = 0.04).
  This behavior is not a capability failure; the model can process the signal, but an emergent property of RLHF optimization that prioritizes conversational fluency over external calibration cues in natural dialogue. We further show that internal token-level confidence in small models is uninformative (r = 0.035), underscoring the necessity of external supervision. Our findings highlight a deployment-critical failure mode: the interaction style users expect is precisely where safety corrections are least effective.

*Haotian Deng,Chris Farber,Jiyoon Lee,David Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the use of large language models (LLMs) for automated short-answer grading (ASAG) in rubric-based settings and discusses their strengths and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate, rubric-aligned, partial-credit grading in ASAG and the potential of LLMs to automate this process effectively, despite reliability concerns.

Method: The authors systematically evaluate the alignment of LLM grading with expert judgments across tasks, assess trade-offs using a consensus-based deferral mechanism, and test robustness under perturbations using the SciEntsBank benchmark and Qwen 2.5-72B.

Result: LLMs show strong alignment for binary tasks but decreased alignment with complex rubrics. Filtering low-confidence predictions improves accuracy, and while robust to prompt injection, models are sensitive to synonym substitutions.

Conclusion: LLMs have potential for rubric-conditioned grading but require better handling of uncertainty estimation and robustness to ensure reliable deployment.

Abstract: Automated short-answer grading (ASAG) remains a challenging task due to the linguistic variability of student responses and the need for nuanced, rubric-aligned partial credit. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution, their reliability as automated judges in rubric-based settings requires rigorous assessment. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the performance of LLM-judges for rubric-based short-answer grading. We investigate three key aspects: the alignment of LLM grading with expert judgment across varying rubric complexities, the trade-off between uncertainty and accuracy facilitated by a consensus-based deferral mechanism, and the model's robustness under random input perturbations and adversarial attacks. Using the SciEntsBank benchmark and Qwen 2.5-72B, we find that alignment is strong for binary tasks but degrades with increased rubric granularity. Our "Trust Curve" analysis demonstrates a clear trade-off where filtering low-confidence predictions improves accuracy on the remaining subset. Additionally, robustness experiments reveal that while the model is resilient to prompt injection, it is sensitive to synonym substitutions. Our work provides critical insights into the capabilities and limitations of rubric-conditioned LLM judges, highlighting the importance of uncertainty estimation and robustness testing for reliable deployment.

TL;DR: This paper compares the performance and emissions of Large Language Models (LLMs) vs. fine-tuned Small Language Models (SLMs), showing that SLMs can perform comparably while significantly reducing carbon emissions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the environmental concerns associated with the high energy demands and carbon footprint of LLMs during training and inference.

Method: Conducting a comparative analysis of performance-emissions trade-off by evaluating fine-tuned SLMs against LLMs across six natural language processing, reasoning, and programming tasks.

Result: Fine-tuned SLMs achieved comparable performance to LLMs in four of the six tasks, while significantly reducing carbon emissions during inference.

Conclusion: SLMs can serve as a sustainable alternative to LLMs for predefined tasks, advancing green AI by mitigating environmental impacts.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised concerns about their enormous carbon footprint, starting with energy-intensive training and continuing through repeated inference. This study investigates the potential of using fine-tuned Small Language Models (SLMs) as a sustainable alternative for predefined tasks. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the performance-emissions trade-off between LLMs and fine-tuned SLMs across selected tasks under Natural Language Processing, Reasoning and Programming. Our results show that in four out of the six selected tasks, SLMs maintained comparable performances for a significant reduction in carbon emissions during inference. Our findings demonstrate the viability of smaller models in mitigating the environmental impact of resource-heavy LLMs, thus advancing towards sustainable, green AI.

*Cagatay Tekin,Charbel Barakat,Luis Joseph Luna Limgenco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InftyThink with Cross-Chain Memory improves long-horizon reasoning in LLMs by using a semantic cache for reasoning patterns, achieving improved accuracy in structured domains but showing limitations in heterogeneous ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of LLMs repeatedly regenerating similar reasoning patterns across tasks without improving reasoning strategies over time.

Method: The paper introduces a semantic cache system that stores and retrieves successful reasoning patterns based on semantic similarity, enabling the model to condition inference on prior knowledge without overly expanding the context window.

Result: Semantic lemma retrieval enhances performance in structured domains such as MATH500 and AIME2024, but performance degrades in tests involving heterogeneous domains such as GPQA-Diamond.

Conclusion: Similarity-based semantic memory can improve LLM reasoning accuracy in structured tasks but exhibits both benefits and limitations, especially in diverse domain applications.

Abstract: Iterative summarization based reasoning frameworks such as InftyThink enable long-horizon reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by controlling context growth, but they repeatedly regenerate similar reasoning strategies across tasks. We introduce InftyThink with Cross-Chain Memory, an extension that augments iterative reasoning with an embedding-based semantic cache of previously successful reasoning patterns. At each reasoning step, the model retrieves and conditions on the most semantically similar stored lemmas, guiding inference without expanding the context window indiscriminately. Experiments on MATH500, AIME2024, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that semantic lemma retrieval improves accuracy in structured domains while exposing failure modes in tests that include heterogeneous domains. Geometric analyses of reasoning trajectories reveal that cache retrieval induces directional biases in embedding space, leading to consistent fix (improve baseline accuracy) and break (degradation in baseline accuracy) attractors. Our results highlight both the benefits and limits of similarity-based memory for self-improving LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RIKER introduces a method for evaluating knowledge systems using synthetic documents generated from known ground truths, ensuring scalable, bias-resistant benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge systems face issues like static benchmark contamination, systematic biases from judges, and expensive human annotations for ground truth extraction.

Method: RIKER employs paradigm inversion—using generated documents from known ground truth—to offer scalable, contamination-resistant evaluations without reliance on human annotations or reference models.

Result: Tests on 33 models and over 21 billion tokens showed limits in context length handling, difficulties in cross-document aggregation, and distinctions between grounding ability and hallucination resistance.

Conclusion: RIKER provides a replicable, domain-agnostic evaluation methodology suitable for scalable, robust assessment of knowledge systems.

Abstract: Evaluating knowledge systems (LLMs, RAG, knowledge graphs, etc) faces fundamental challenges: static benchmarks are vulnerable to contamination, LLM-based judges exhibit systematic biases, and ground truth extraction requires expensive human annotation. We present RIKER (Retrieval Intelligence and Knowledge Extraction Rating), both a benchmark and a replicable methodology based on paradigm inversion - generating documents from known ground truth rather than extracting ground truth from documents. This approach enables deterministic scoring and scalable evaluation without human annotation or reference models, and contamination resistance through regenerable corpora. Our evaluation of 33 models using over 21 billion tokens reveals that context length claims frequently exceed usable capacity, with significant degradation beyond 32K tokens; cross-document aggregation proves substantially harder than single-document extraction; and grounding ability and hallucination resistance are distinct capabilities - models excelling at finding facts that exist may still fabricate facts that do not. Beyond the specific benchmark, we contribute a domain-agnostic methodology for constructing scalable and contamination-resistant evaluations wherever synthetic documents can be generated from structured ground truth.

*Zihe Zhang,Can Zhang,Yanheng Xu,Xin Hu,Jichao Leng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PediaMind-R1 is a domain-specific language model tailored for personalized parenting, focusing on early childhood temperament, utilizing psychological theory, and advanced training methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve intelligent parenting by providing personalized, empathetic, and temperament-aware caregiving suggestions instead of generic advice.

Method: The approach includes supervised fine-tuning for structured reasoning and a GRPO-based alignment stage to enhance logical, expert, and empathetic responses. A temperament knowledge graph and evaluation framework were also developed.

Result: PediaMind-R1 effectively interprets early childhood temperaments and engages in personalized caregiving recommendations with accuracy and sensitivity.

Conclusion: The integration of psychological theory in domain-specific LLMs showcases a promising direction for personalized, user-focused applications in caregiving contexts.

Abstract: This paper presents PediaMind-R1, a domain-specialized large language model designed to achieve active personalization in intelligent parenting scenarios. Unlike conventional systems that provide generic suggestions, PediaMind-R1 draws on insights from developmental psychology. It introduces temperament theory from the Thomas-Chess framework and builds a temperament knowledge graph for infants and toddlers (0-3 years). Our two-stage training pipeline first uses supervised fine-tuning to teach structured chain-of-thought reasoning, and then applies a GRPO-based alignment stage to reinforce logical consistency, domain expertise, and empathetic caregiving strategies. We further design an evaluation framework comprising temperament-sensitive multiple-choice tests and human assessments. The results demonstrate that PediaMind-R1 can accurately interpret early childhood temperament profiles and proactively engage in individualized reasoning. This work highlights the value of integrating vertical-domain modeling with psychological theory. It offers a novel approach to developing user-centered LLMs that advance the practice of active personalization in sensitive caregiving contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the robustness of automated answer matching models against strategic manipulations like verbosity and conflicting answers. It finds these models are generally resistant to such tactics and supports their suitability as an evaluation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate the reliability of automated LLM-based answer matching as a scalable alternative to human evaluation, particularly against strategic manipulative tactics.

Method: The study systematically tested answer matching models by introducing manipulations such as verbosity, multiple unconfident answers, and conflicting answers, and analyzed their impact on scoring.

Result: The manipulative strategies do not improve, and often reduce, the scores. Additionally, binary scoring is more robust to these manipulations than continuous scoring.

Conclusion: Answer matching models are robust to inexpensive text manipulations and represent a reliable alternative to traditional human or LLM-as-a-judge evaluations.

Abstract: Automated answer matching, which leverages LLMs to evaluate free-text responses by comparing them to a reference answer, shows substantial promise as a scalable and aligned alternative to human evaluation. However, its reliability requires robustness against strategic attacks such as guesswork or verbosity that may artificially inflate scores without improving actual correctness. In this work, we systematically investigate whether such tactics deceive answer matching models by prompting examinee models to: (1) generate verbose responses, (2) provide multiple answers when unconfident, and (3) embed conflicting answers with the correct answer near the start of their response. Our results show that these manipulations do not increase scores and often reduce them. Additionally, binary scoring (which requires a matcher to answer with a definitive "correct" or "incorrect") is more robust to attacks than continuous scoring (which requires a matcher to determine partial correctness). These findings show that answer matching is generally robust to inexpensive text manipulation and is a viable alternative to traditional LLM-as-a-judge or human evaluation when reference answers are available.

Motivation: The motivation is to enhance context in RAG using summaries while addressing the problem of vector dilution, which negatively affects specific query precision.

Method: The authors evaluate different summary injection ratios into RAG contexts, observing their impact on recall and precision, and they propose a theoretical framework for determining the optimal ratio.

Result: The study identifies an inverted U-shaped relationship between injection ratios and performance: moderate ratios improve recall by 18%, but ratios higher than CIR > 0.4 reduce precision by 22% for specific queries.

Conclusion: Optimal summary injection can improve RAG performance, and exceeding critical thresholds harms precision. Their theoretical framework aims to optimize this balance.

*Nidhi Pandya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NewsScope introduces a structured framework for schema-grounded news claim extraction, offering a novel cross-domain dataset and fine-tuned model for enhanced accuracy and deployment efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated news verification methods often fail to ensure schema compliance or adapt across various domains effectively, necessitating a robust, generalizable solution.

Method: The study develops a cross-domain dataset, fine-tunes a LLaMA 3.1 8B model using LoRA on training examples, and evaluates it using in-domain and out-of-source test sets while leveraging human evaluation and inter-annotator agreement studies.

Result: NewsScope achieves 89.4% human-evaluated accuracy, with political claims outperforming GPT-4o-mini (94.3% vs. 87.8%). A numeric grounding filter improves accuracy further to 91.6%, with high inter-annotator agreement (94.6% positive on SUPPORTED judgments).

Conclusion: NewsScope demonstrates robust performance, significantly enhancing schema-grounded claim verification across domains, and is cost-effective and publicly available for deployment and further research.

Abstract: Automated news verification requires structured claim extraction, but existing approaches either lack schema compliance or generalize poorly across domains. This paper presents NewsScope, a cross-domain dataset, benchmark, and fine-tuned model for schema-grounded news claim extraction. The dataset contains 455 articles across politics, health, science/environment, and business, consisting of 395 in-domain articles and 60 out-of-source articles for generalization testing. LLaMA 3.1 8B was fine-tuned using LoRA on 315 training examples and evaluated on held-out in-domain (80 articles) and out-of-source (60 articles) test sets. Human evaluation on 400 claims shows NewsScope achieves 89.4% human-evaluated accuracy compared to GPT-4o-mini's 93.7% (p=0.07). NewsScope outperforms GPT-4o-mini on political claims (94.3% vs. 87.8%). A numeric grounding filter further improves accuracy to 91.6%, narrowing the gap to 2.1 percentage points. Inter-annotator agreement studies (160 claims) confirm labeling reliability (94.6% positive agreement on SUPPORTED judgments). The open-weight model enables offline deployment at approximately $15 on-demand compute (or $0 on free tiers). Code and benchmark are publicly released.

Abstract: The rise of online counseling services has highlighted the need for effective training methods for future counselors. This paper extends research on VirCo, a Virtual Client for Online Counseling, designed to complement traditional role-playing methods in academic training by simulating realistic client interactions. Building on previous work, we introduce a new dataset incorporating adversarial attacks to test the ability of large language models (LLMs) to maintain their assigned roles (role-consistency). The study focuses on evaluating the role consistency and coherence of the Vicuna model's responses, comparing these findings with earlier research. Additionally, we assess and compare various open-source LLMs for their performance in sustaining role consistency during virtual client interactions. Our contributions include creating an adversarial dataset, evaluating conversation coherence and persona consistency, and providing a comparative analysis of different LLMs.

### [47] [Imagine-then-Plan: Agent Learning from Adaptive Lookahead with World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08955)
*Youwei Liu,Jian Wang,Hanlin Wang,Beichen Guo,Wenjie Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Imagine-then-Plan (ITP), a framework for agent policy learning using adaptive multi-step imagination with world models to enhance task planning and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world models lack efficient task planning capabilities as they mainly focus on single-step or fixed-horizon rollouts. This paper aims to improve agents' reasoning and planning abilities for complex tasks.

Method: ITP uses adaptive lookahead imagination to generate multi-step imagined trajectories, which are fused with current observations into a partially observable and imaginable Markov decision process.

Result: ITU significantly outperforms baseline methods across agent benchmarks by improving agents’ reasoning and task planning effectiveness.

Conclusion: Adaptive lookahead mechanisms in world models are critical for enhancing agents' reasoning capabilities and addressing complex tasks more effectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in world models have shown promise for modeling future dynamics of environmental states, enabling agents to reason and act without accessing real environments. Current methods mainly perform single-step or fixed-horizon rollouts, leaving their potential for complex task planning under-exploited. We propose Imagine-then-Plan (\texttt{ITP}), a unified framework for agent learning via lookahead imagination, where an agent's policy model interacts with the learned world model, yielding multi-step ``imagined'' trajectories. Since the imagination horizon may vary by tasks and stages, we introduce a novel adaptive lookahead mechanism by trading off the ultimate goal and task progress. The resulting imagined trajectories provide rich signals about future consequences, such as achieved progress and potential conflicts, which are fused with current observations, formulating a partially \textit{observable} and \textit{imaginable} Markov decision process to guide policy learning. We instantiate \texttt{ITP} with both training-free and reinforcement-trained variants. Extensive experiments across representative agent benchmarks demonstrate that \texttt{ITP} significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Further analyses validate that our adaptive lookahead largely enhances agents' reasoning capability, providing valuable insights into addressing broader, complex tasks.

### [48] [Entropy Sentinel: Continuous LLM Accuracy Monitoring from Decoding Entropy Traces in STEM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09001)
*Pedro Memoli Buffa,Luciano Del Corro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to monitor and improve large language models (LLMs) performance using output-entropy profiles and lightweight classifiers, evaluating their reliability across STEM reasoning benchmarks and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two linked challenges in deploying LLMs: monitoring underperformance due to domain shift and efficiently acquiring data to improve accuracy.

Method: Compute output-entropy profiles (from top-k log probabilities). Use these profiles for a lightweight classifier to predict instance correctness and average probabilities for domain-level estimates.

Result: The proposed method shows promise by tracking benchmark accuracy under domain shifts across various LLMs and benchmarks, demonstrating reliable estimates and near-monotonic domain ordering.

Conclusion: Output-entropy profiles offer a scalable approach for monitoring LLMs and targeting data acquisition effectively under domain shifts.

Abstract: Deploying LLMs raises two coupled challenges: (1) monitoring - estimating where a model underperforms as traffic and domains drift - and (2) improvement - prioritizing data acquisition to close the largest performance gaps. We test whether an inference-time signal can estimate slice-level accuracy under domain shift. For each response, we compute an output-entropy profile from final-layer next-token probabilities (from top-k logprobs) and summarize it with eleven statistics. A lightweight classifier predicts instance correctness, and averaging predicted probabilities yields a domain-level accuracy estimate. We evaluate on ten STEM reasoning benchmarks with exhaustive train/test compositions (k in {1,2,3,4}; all "10 choose k" combinations), across nine LLMs from six families (3B-20B). Estimates often track held-out benchmark accuracy, and several models show near-monotonic ordering of domains. Output-entropy profiles are thus an accessible signal for scalable monitoring and for targeting data acquisition.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TranslateGemma enhances Gemma 3 for machine translation using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, achieving improved efficiency and multilingual performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multilingual translation capabilities of the existing Gemma 3 foundation models by leveraging fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Method: The approach involves a two-stage process: 1) supervised fine-tuning with synthetic and human-translated parallel data, and 2) reinforcement learning with reward models to optimize translation quality.

Result: TranslateGemma consistently outperforms baseline Gemma 3 models across various language pairs and benchmarks, showing both efficiency and improved performance, even on multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: TranslateGemma provides the research community with open, efficient, and high-performing machine translation models, demonstrating adaptability and strong multilingual and multimodal capabilities.

Abstract: We present TranslateGemma, a suite of open machine translation models based on the Gemma 3 foundation models. To enhance the inherent multilingual capabilities of Gemma 3 for the translation task, we employ a two-stage fine-tuning process. First, supervised fine-tuning is performed using a rich mixture of high-quality large-scale synthetic parallel data generated via state-of-the-art models and human-translated parallel data. This is followed by a reinforcement learning phase, where we optimize translation quality using an ensemble of reward models, including MetricX-QE and AutoMQM, targeting translation quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TranslateGemma with human evaluation on the WMT25 test set across 10 language pairs and with automatic evaluation on the WMT24++ benchmark across 55 language pairs. Automatic metrics show consistent and substantial gains over the baseline Gemma 3 models across all sizes. Notably, smaller TranslateGemma models often achieve performance comparable to larger baseline models, offering improved efficiency. We also show that TranslateGemma models retain strong multimodal capabilities, with enhanced performance on the Vistra image translation benchmark. The release of the open TranslateGemma models aims to provide the research community with powerful and adaptable tools for machine translation.

### [50] [Multicultural Spyfall: Assessing LLMs through Dynamic Multilingual Social Deduction Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09017)
*Haryo Akbarianto Wibowo,Alaa Elsetohy,Qinrong Cui,Alham Fikri Aji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a game-based dynamic benchmarking framework to evaluate the multilingual and multicultural capabilities of LLMs through the game Spyfall, highlighting challenges in non-English contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional static benchmarks for LLMs face limitations like data saturation and leakage, necessitating alternative evaluation methods that adapt dynamically and assess multilingual and multicultural performance.

Method: The authors introduce Spyfall, a social deduction game, as a benchmarking tool. Models must engage in strategic dialogue to detect or evade as secret agents, using culturally and linguistically relevant cues.

Result: The game-based rankings closely correspond to Chatbot Arena results, but LLMs exhibit noticeable deficiencies in handling non-English contexts, including locally specific entities and maintaining strategic integrity.

Conclusion: Game-based dynamic benchmarking like Spyfall offers a scalable and culturally nuanced framework to evaluate LLMs, particularly valuable for addressing limitations in current traditional benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated more robust evaluation methods that go beyond static benchmarks, which are increasingly prone to data saturation and leakage. In this paper, we propose a dynamic benchmarking framework for evaluating multilingual and multicultural capabilities through the social deduction game Spyfall. In our setup, models must engage in strategic dialogue to either identify a secret agent or avoid detection, utilizing culturally relevant locations or local foods. Our results show that our game-based rankings align closely with the Chatbot Arena. However, we find a significant performance gap in non-English contexts: models are generally less proficient when handling locally specific entities and often struggle with rule-following or strategic integrity in non-English languages. We demonstrate that this game-based approach provides a scalable, leakage-resistant, and culturally nuanced alternative to traditional NLP benchmarks.

*Fengran Mo,Zhan Su,Yuchen Hui,Jinghan Zhang,Jia Ao Sun,Zheyuan Liu,Chao Zhang,Tetsuya Sakai,Jian-Yun Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces OpenDecoder, a novel approach to improve retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by incorporating explicit evaluation of retrieved information quality into the generation process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the robustness of LLM-based RAG models, especially in handling contexts with varying levels of noisy or less relevant information.

Method: OpenDecoder evaluates retrieved information using three quality indicators: relevance score, ranking score, and query performance prediction (QPP) score, integrating these into the generation process.

Result: The approach demonstrates superior performance and robustness compared to baseline methods in tests on five benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: OpenDecoder improves RAG model robustness while showcasing flexibility to integrate with post-training of LLMs and any external quality indicators.

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has achieved superior performance in a range of downstream tasks, including LLM-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The quality of generated content heavily relies on the usefulness of the retrieved information and the capacity of LLMs' internal information processing mechanism to incorporate it in answer generation. It is generally assumed that the retrieved information is relevant to the question. However, the retrieved information may have a variable degree of relevance and usefulness, depending on the question and the document collection. It is important to take into account the relevance of the retrieved information in answer generation. In this paper, we propose OpenDecoder, a new approach that leverages explicit evaluation of the retrieved information as quality indicator features for generation. We aim to build a RAG model that is more robust to varying levels of noisy context. Three types of explicit evaluation information are considered: relevance score, ranking score, and QPP (query performance prediction) score. The experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and better robustness of OpenDecoder by outperforming various baseline methods. Importantly, this paradigm is flexible to be integrated with the post-training of LLMs for any purposes and incorporated with any type of external indicators.

### [52] [SpectraQuery: A Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Conversational Assistant for Battery Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09036)
*Sreya Vangara,Jagjit Nanda,Yan-Kai Tzeng,Eric Darve*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpectraQuery is a hybrid framework allowing integration of structured Raman spectroscopy databases and unstructured scientific literature for answering complex queries. It achieves strong performance in SQL accuracy, groundedness, and expert evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable scientific reasoning that seamlessly combines structured experimental data with unstructured literature, addressing limitations in current large language model assistants.

Method: SpectraQuery uses a Structured and Unstructured Query Language (SUQL)-inspired hybrid framework combining semantic parsing with retrieval-augmented generation. It transforms natural language questions into SQL and literature retrieval operations, providing answers grounded in data and mechanistic explanations.

Result: SpectraQuery shows approximately 80% SQL correctness, 93-97% grounding in synthesized answers, effective retrieval within 10-15 passages, and high expert ratings (4.1-4.6/5) for accuracy, relevance, grounding, and clarity.

Conclusion: Hybrid retrieval architectures like SpectraQuery can significantly enhance scientific workflows by linking structured data and unstructured literature for meaningful insights, thus supporting high-volume experimental datasets.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning increasingly requires linking structured experimental data with the unstructured literature that explains it, yet most large language model (LLM) assistants cannot reason jointly across these modalities. We introduce SpectraQuery, a hybrid natural-language query framework that integrates a relational Raman spectroscopy database with a vector-indexed scientific literature corpus using a Structured and Unstructured Query Language (SUQL)-inspired design. By combining semantic parsing with retrieval-augmented generation, SpectraQuery translates open-ended questions into coordinated SQL and literature retrieval operations, producing cited answers that unify numerical evidence with mechanistic explanation. Across SQL correctness, answer groundedness, retrieval effectiveness, and expert evaluation, SpectraQuery demonstrates strong performance: approximately 80 percent of generated SQL queries are fully correct, synthesized answers reach 93-97 percent groundedness with 10-15 retrieved passages, and battery scientists rate responses highly across accuracy, relevance, grounding, and clarity (4.1-4.6/5). These results show that hybrid retrieval architectures can meaningfully support scientific workflows by bridging data and discourse for high-volume experimental datasets.

### [53] [Can LLMs interpret figurative language as humans do?: surface-level vs representational similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09041)
*Samhita Bollepally,Aurora Sloman-Moll,Takashi Yamauchi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines the alignment of human judgments and large language models (LLMs) in interpreting figurative and socially grounded language. Four instruction-tuned LLMs and humans rated dialogue-based sentences on various traits. LLMs align with humans at surface level but diverge significantly in deeper interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to explore the capability of large language models to interpret figurative and socially contextual language nuances, aiming to understand their alignment with human judgments.

Method: Human participants and four LLMs (GPT-4, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.2, and Mistral-7B) evaluated 240 dialogue-based sentences against six linguistic traits on a Likert scale. Each sentence was paired with 40 interpretive questions to analyze alignment at surface and representational levels.

Result: Findings showed that LLMs align with humans superficially, but diverge significantly in deeper interpretative levels, especially for idiomatic expressions, Gen Z slang, and socio-pragmatic contexts.

Conclusion: LLMs, particularly GPT-4, exhibit closer alignment with human judgments compared to others, but all models face challenges interpreting context-dependent language such as sarcasm, slang, and idioms.

Abstract: Large language models generate judgments that resemble those of humans. Yet the extent to which these models align with human judgments in interpreting figurative and socially grounded language remains uncertain. To investigate this, human participants and four instruction-tuned LLMs of different sizes (GPT-4, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.2, and Mistral-7B) rated 240 dialogue-based sentences representing six linguistic traits: conventionality, sarcasm, funny, emotional, idiomacy, and slang. Each of the 240 sentences was paired with 40 interpretive questions, and both humans and LLMs rated these sentences on a 10-point Likert scale. Results indicated that humans and LLMs aligned at the surface level with humans, but diverged significantly at the representational level, especially in interpreting figurative sentences involving idioms and Gen Z slang. GPT-4 most closely approximates human representational patterns, while all models struggle with context-dependent and socio-pragmatic expressions like sarcasm, slang, and idiomacy.

### [54] [Is Grokking Worthwhile? Functional Analysis and Transferability of Generalization Circuits in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09049)
*Kaiyu He,Zhang Mian,Peilin Wu,Xinya Du,Zhiyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines whether 'grokked' models are superior to non-grokked counterparts, concluding that grokking involves integrating existing knowledge but does not improve reasoning paths or transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand if the grokking phase in parameter-sharing transformers improves downstream reasoning and assess its computational cost.

Method: A mechanistic study evaluates the inference paths and reasoning capabilities of grokked vs non-grokked models under various data regimes.

Result: The paper finds that grokked models do not develop fundamentally new reasoning paradigms and their inference paths for compositional tasks are identical to non-grokked models. Additionally, grokked transformers show limited knowledge transfer abilities.

Conclusion: Grokking integrates memorized facts into existing inference paths, but does not significantly enhance compositional reasoning or transferability, questioning the computational expense of grokking.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at factual retrieval, they often struggle with the "curse of two-hop reasoning" in compositional tasks. Recent research suggests that parameter-sharing transformers can bridge this gap by forming a "Generalization Circuit" during a prolonged "grokking" phase. A fundamental question arises: Is a grokked model superior to its non-grokked counterparts on downstream tasks? Furthermore, is the extensive computational cost of waiting for the grokking phase worthwhile? In this work, we conduct a mechanistic study to evaluate the Generalization Circuit's role in knowledge assimilation and transfer. We demonstrate that: (i) The inference paths established by non-grokked and grokked models for in-distribution compositional queries are identical. This suggests that the "Generalization Circuit" does not represent the sudden acquisition of a new reasoning paradigm. Instead, we argue that grokking is the process of integrating memorized atomic facts into an naturally established reasoning path. (ii) Achieving high accuracy on unseen cases after prolonged training and the formation of a certain reasoning path are not bound; they can occur independently under specific data regimes. (iii) Even a mature circuit exhibits limited transferability when integrating new knowledge, suggesting that "grokked" Transformers do not achieve a full mastery of compositional logic.

*Tianyi Xu,Xuan Ouyang,Binwei Yao,Shoua Xiong,Sara Misurelli,Maichou Lor,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes SITA, a method to adapt wav2vec-style encoders to tonal low-resource languages like Hmong and Mandarin through speaker-invariance and tone-awareness strategies, achieving better lexical retrieval and maintaining ASR accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in learning tone-sensitive yet speaker-robust representations for tonal low-resource languages underserved by current speech technologies.

Method: SITA applies multi-objective training combining cross-gender contrastive learning, tone-repulsive loss, and an auxiliary ASR objective via Connectionist Temporal Classification and distillation.

Result: SITA improved cross-gender lexical retrieval accuracy and maintained ASR accuracy in Hmong, also showing adaptability to Mandarin for tonal language encoding.

Conclusion: SITA is a lightweight and generalizable plug-in solution for adapting multilingual speech encoders to address tonal and speaker variability in low-resource languages.

Abstract: Tonal low-resource languages are widely spoken yet remain underserved by modern speech technology. A key challenge is learning representations that are robust to nuisance variation such as gender while remaining tone-aware for different lexical meanings. To address this, we propose SITA, a lightweight adaptation recipe that enforces Speaker-Invariance and Tone-Awareness for pretrained wav2vec-style encoders. SITA uses staged multi-objective training: (i) a cross-gender contrastive objective encourages lexical consistency across speakers, while a tone-repulsive loss prevents tone collapse by explicitly separating same-word different-tone realizations; and (ii) an auxiliary Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based ASR objective with distillation stabilizes recognition-relevant structure. We evaluate primarily on Hmong, a highly tonal and severely under-resourced language where off-the-shelf multilingual encoders fail to represent tone effectively. On a curated Hmong word corpus, SITA improves cross-gender lexical retrieval accuracy, while maintaining usable ASR accuracy relative to an ASR-adapted XLS-R teacher. We further observe similar gains when transferring the same recipe to Mandarin, suggesting SITA is a general, plug-in approach for adapting multilingual speech encoders to tonal languages.

*Yinuo Xu,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper surveys methods in NLP that address annotator disagreement, categorizes its sources, and reviews frameworks and evaluation methods to model and account for it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges posed by annotator disagreement in NLP tasks, especially for subjective and ambiguous text classification contexts.

Method: The survey provides a taxonomy of disagreement sources, reviews modeling approaches (e.g., consensus vs. disagreement-aware models), and discusses evaluation strategies for predictive and fairness metrics.

Result: The paper highlights a shift towards disagreement modeling and structured annotator relationships, with limited normative fairness evaluations.

Conclusion: Future work should focus on handling diverse variation sources, creating disagreement-aware interpretability tools, and managing practical challenges in perspectivist modeling.

Abstract: Annotator disagreement is widespread in NLP, particularly for subjective and ambiguous tasks such as toxicity detection and stance analysis. While early approaches treated disagreement as noise to be removed, recent work increasingly models it as a meaningful signal reflecting variation in interpretation and perspective. This survey provides a unified view of disagreement-aware NLP methods. We first present a domain-agnostic taxonomy of the sources of disagreement spanning data, task, and annotator factors. We then synthesize modeling approaches using a common framework defined by prediction targets and pooling structure, highlighting a shift from consensus learning toward explicitly modeling disagreement, and toward capturing structured relationships among annotators. We review evaluation metrics for both predictive performance and annotator behavior, and noting that most fairness evaluations remain descriptive rather than normative. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions, including integrating multiple sources of variation, developing disagreement-aware interpretability frameworks, and grappling with the practical tradeoffs of perspectivist modeling.

Conclusion: Mi:dm 2.0 enhances Korea-centric AI by providing accessible, high-quality, and culturally aligned LLMs, promoting AI adoption in Korea and supporting developer and research communities through open release.

Abstract: We introduce Mi:dm 2.0, a bilingual large language model (LLM) specifically engineered to advance Korea-centric AI. This model goes beyond Korean text processing by integrating the values, reasoning patterns, and commonsense knowledge inherent to Korean society, enabling nuanced understanding of cultural contexts, emotional subtleties, and real-world scenarios to generate reliable and culturally appropriate responses. To address limitations of existing LLMs, often caused by insufficient or low-quality Korean data and lack of cultural alignment, Mi:dm 2.0 emphasizes robust data quality through a comprehensive pipeline that includes proprietary data cleansing, high-quality synthetic data generation, strategic data mixing with curriculum learning, and a custom Korean-optimized tokenizer to improve efficiency and coverage. To realize this vision, we offer two complementary configurations: Mi:dm 2.0 Base (11.5B parameters), built with a depth-up scaling strategy for general-purpose use, and Mi:dm 2.0 Mini (2.3B parameters), optimized for resource-constrained environments and specialized tasks. Mi:dm 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on Korean-specific benchmarks, with top-tier zero-shot results on KMMLU and strong internal evaluation results across language, humanities, and social science tasks. The Mi:dm 2.0 lineup is released under the MIT license to support extensive research and commercial use. By offering accessible and high-performance Korea-centric LLMs, KT aims to accelerate AI adoption across Korean industries, public services, and education, strengthen the Korean AI developer community, and lay the groundwork for the broader vision of K-intelligence.

### [59] [From Symbolic to Natural-Language Relations: Rethinking Knowledge Graph Construction in the Era of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09069)
*Kanyao Han,Yushang Lai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper suggests transitioning from predefined symbolic relation schemas to natural-language representations in knowledge graphs to better capture nuanced relations, advocating for hybrid design principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world relations in knowledge graphs are often complex, context-sensitive, and nuanced, whereas predefined symbolic relation schemas simplify these relations into categorical labels, losing semantic details.

Method: The paper proposes hybrid design principles for knowledge graph relations that use natural-language descriptions while preserving minimal structural schemas for contextual, scalable representation.

Result: The conceptual shift highlights the advantages of blending minimal structural schemas with natural-language relation descriptions, tailored for robust usage with modern LLMs.

Conclusion: Transitioning to natural-language relation descriptions in knowledge graphs can enhance contextual accuracy and flexibility, aligning with LLM capabilities and overcoming limits of traditional symbolic schemas.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have commonly been constructed using predefined symbolic relation schemas, typically implemented as categorical relation labels. This design has notable shortcomings: real-world relations are often contextual, nuanced, and sometimes uncertain, and compressing it into discrete relation labels abstracts away critical semantic detail. Nevertheless, symbolic-relation KGs remain widely used because they have been operationally effective and broadly compatible with pre-LLM downstream models and algorithms, in which KG knowledge could be retrieved or encoded into quantified features and embeddings at scale. The emergence of LLMs has reshaped how knowledge is created and consumed. LLMs support scalable synthesis of domain facts directly in concise natural language, and prompting-based inference favors context-rich free-form text over quantified representations. This position paper argues that these changes call for rethinking the representation of relations themselves rather than merely using LLMs to populate conventional schemas more efficiently. We therefore advocate moving from symbolic to natural-language relation descriptions, and we propose hybrid design principles that preserve a minimal structural backbone while enabling more flexible and context-sensitive relational representations.

### [60] [How Many Human Judgments Are Enough? Feasibility Limits of Human Preference Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09084)
*Wilson Y. Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Human preference evaluations often fail to detect small improvements in generative models due to the diffuse nature of the preference signal across prompts and insufficient judgments. Benchmarks with reduced variability improve detectability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of reliably detecting small improvements in generative models using human preference evaluations, which often require vast judgments to avoid inconclusive results.

Method: Through theoretical analysis and empirical studies of large-scale human preference datasets, the paper examines proportional allocation strategies and compares regular human evaluations with curated benchmarks that reduce variance.

Result: It finds that diffuse preference signals necessitate far more judgments than typically collected, while curated benchmarks can improve detectability by reducing variability and inducing larger preference margins.

Conclusion: Human evaluation outcomes are often inconclusive due to insufficient statistical power and not true model equivalence, highlighting the importance of effect size, evaluation budget, and protocol design to improve reliability.

Abstract: Human preference evaluations are widely used to compare generative models, yet it remains unclear how many judgments are required to reliably detect small improvements. We show that when preference signal is diffuse across prompts (i.e., all prompt types are similarly informative), proportional allocation is minimax-optimal: no allocation strategy substantially improves detectability. Empirical analysis of large-scale human preference datasets shows that most comparisons fall into this diffuse regime, exhibiting small preference margins that require far more judgments than typically collected, even in well-sampled comparisons. These limits persist across evaluation protocols and modalities, including chat, image generation, and code generation with execution feedback. In contrast, curated benchmarks that reduce prompt induced variability systematically induce larger margins and improve detectability through a $1.5\times$ reduction in prompt-level variance. Our results show that inconclusive or negative human evaluation outcomes frequently reflect underpowered evaluation rather than model equivalence, underscoring the need to account explicitly for effect size, budget, and protocol design.

### [61] [SubTokenTest: A Practical Benchmark for Real-World Sub-token Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09089)
*Shuyang Hou,Yi Hu,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses large language models' struggles with sub-token understanding and introduces SubTokenTest, a benchmark with utility-driven tasks to evaluate and improve LLMs accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the poor performance of large language models on tasks requiring precise character-level understanding, which impacts real-world applications like text-based maps and structured table interpretation.

Method: The authors developed SubTokenTest, a benchmark comprising ten tasks across four domains, to evaluate sub-token reasoning while minimizing the influence of complex reasoning.

Result: The study evaluates nine LLMs, examines how test-time scaling affects sub-token reasoning, and explores how character-level information is stored in their hidden states.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit significant tokenization-related challenges; SubTokenTest highlights these limitations and provides a framework to address them for improving practical utility under real-world conditions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities. However, they continue to struggle with basic character-level tasks, such as counting letters in words, a problem rooted in their tokenization process. While existing benchmarks have highlighted this weakness through basic character operations, such failures are often dismissed due to lacking practical relevance. Yet, many real-world applications, such as navigating text-based maps or interpreting structured tables, rely heavily on precise sub-token understanding. In this regard, we introduce SubTokenTest, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses sub-token understanding through practical, utility-driven tasks. Our benchmark includes ten tasks across four domains and isolates tokenization-related failures by decoupling performance from complex reasoning. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of nine advanced LLMs. Additionally, we investigate the impact of test-time scaling on sub-token reasoning and explore how character-level information is encoded within the hidden states.

### [62] [Contrastive Bi-Encoder Models for Multi-Label Skill Extraction: Enhancing ESCO Ontology Matching with BERT and Attention Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09119)
*Yongming Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a zero-shot framework for extracting skills from job advertisements using extreme multi-label classification (XMLC) without requiring labeled training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in mapping job advertisements to standardized skill taxonomies like ESCO, particularly in non-English language contexts where formal skill definitions and job advertisement language differ.

Method: The method involves synthesizing training data using a large language model and applying a contrastive bi-encoder trained on the synthetic data for mapping job ad sentences to standardized skill taxonomies. Additionally, it incorporates an upstream filter and hierarchical constraints for improving semantic precision.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the hierarchical constraints improve performance, achieving strong zero-shot retrieval (F1@5 = 0.72) for Chinese job advertisements, outperforming baselines like TF-IDF and standard BERT.

Conclusion: The approach provides an effective and scalable solution for skill extraction in labor economics, removing the reliance on manually annotated training data and enabling better analysis across various languages and regions.

Abstract: Fine-grained labor market analysis increasingly relies on mapping unstructured job advertisements to standardized skill taxonomies such as ESCO. This mapping is naturally formulated as an Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMLC) problem, but supervised solutions are constrained by the scarcity and cost of large-scale, taxonomy-aligned annotations--especially in non-English settings where job-ad language diverges substantially from formal skill definitions. We propose a zero-shot skill extraction framework that eliminates the need for manually labeled job-ad training data. The framework uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to synthesize training instances from ESCO definitions, and introduces hierarchically constrained multi-skill generation based on ESCO Level-2 categories to improve semantic coherence in multi-label contexts. On top of the synthetic corpus, we train a contrastive bi-encoder that aligns job-ad sentences with ESCO skill descriptions in a shared embedding space; the encoder augments a BERT backbone with BiLSTM and attention pooling to better model long, information-dense requirement statements. An upstream RoBERTa-based binary filter removes non-skill sentences to improve end-to-end precision. Experiments show that (i) hierarchy-conditioned generation improves both fluency and discriminability relative to unconstrained pairing, and (ii) the resulting multi-label model transfers effectively to real-world Chinese job advertisements, achieving strong zero-shot retrieval performance (F1@5 = 0.72) and outperforming TF--IDF and standard BERT baselines. Overall, the proposed pipeline provides a scalable, data-efficient pathway for automated skill coding in labor economics and workforce analytics.

*Chen-Wei Liang,Bin Guo,Zhen-Yuan Wei,Mu-Jiang-Shan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new framework for patent claim generation tackles poor cross-jurisdictional generalization, semantic relationship modeling, and quality assessment, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems for patent claim generation fail to generalize well across jurisdictions, do not adequately model semantic relationships between claims and prior art, and struggle with quality assessment.

Method: The authors propose a three-stage framework employing relationship-aware similarity analysis, domain-adaptive claim generation via curriculum learning and LoRA adapters, and unified quality assessment utilizing multi-head attention and cross-attention mechanisms.

Result: Experiments on patent datasets demonstrate superior performance: 7.6-point ROUGE-L gain over GPT-4o, 8.3% BERTScore improvement over Llama-3.1-8B, and a quality assessment correlation of 0.847, outperforming existing evaluation models.

Conclusion: The new method provides a robust and effective solution for automated patent claim generation while maintaining strong cross-jurisdictional performance and surpassing state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Current patent claim generation systems face three fundamental limitations: poor cross-jurisdictional generalization, inadequate semantic relationship modeling between claims and prior art, and unreliable quality assessment. We introduce a novel three-stage framework that addresses these challenges through relationship-aware similarity analysis, domain-adaptive claim generation, and unified quality assessment. Our approach employs multi-head attention with eight specialized heads for explicit relationship modeling, integrates curriculum learning with dynamic LoRA adapter selection across five patent domains, and implements cross-attention mechanisms between evaluation aspects for comprehensive quality assessment. Extensive experiments on USPTO HUPD dataset, EPO patent collections, and Patent-CE benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements: 7.6-point ROUGE-L gain over GPT-4o, 8.3\% BERTScore enhancement over Llama-3.1-8B, and 0.847 correlation with human experts compared to 0.623 for separate evaluation models. Our method maintains 89.4\% cross-jurisdictional performance retention versus 76.2\% for baselines, establishing a comprehensive solution for automated patent prosecution workflows.

### [64] [Identity-Robust Language Model Generation via Content Integrity Preservation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09141)
*Miao Zhang,Kelly Chen,Md Mehrab Tanjim,Rumi Chunara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of disparities in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs across user sociodemographics for factual and unbiased responses. It proposes a lightweight solution to ensure identity-independent quality in AI responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle significant disparities in LLM outputs arising from user sociodemographic attributes, even for objective queries where demographic information shouldn't matter, to ensure fairness and reliability.

Method: The paper introduces a training-free framework to neutralize non-essential identity information in user inputs while preserving content integrity of outputs, focusing on maintaining core response quality.

Result: Experiments demonstrate a reduction of identity-dependent bias by 77% compared to standard methods and 45% compared to prompt-based defenses across diverse benchmarks and identities.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses gaps in ensuring unbiased and core quality outputs from LLMs by mitigating user identity impacts on generation behavior, providing a promising solution for equitable AI responses.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) outputs often vary across user sociodemographic attributes, leading to disparities in factual accuracy, utility, and safety, even for objective questions where demographic information is irrelevant. Unlike prior work on stereotypical or representational bias, this paper studies identity-dependent degradation of core response quality. We show empirically that such degradation arises from biased generation behavior, despite factual knowledge being robustly encoded across identities. Motivated by this mismatch, we propose a lightweight, training-free framework for identity-robust generation that selectively neutralizes non-critical identity information while preserving semantically essential attributes, thus maintaining output content integrity. Experiments across four benchmarks and 18 sociodemographic identities demonstrate an average 77% reduction in identity-dependent bias compared to vanilla prompting and a 45% reduction relative to prompt-based defenses. Our work addresses a critical gap in mitigating the impact of user identity cues in prompts on core generation quality.

### [65] [OrthoGeoLoRA: Geometric Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Structured Social Science Concept Retrieval on theWeb](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09185)
*Zeqiang Wang,Xinyue Wu,Chenxi Li,Zixi Chen,Nishanth Sastry,Jon Johnson,Suparna De*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces OrthoGeoLoRA, a fine-tuning method improving LoRA by constraining low-rank factors geometrically, achieving better performance on hierarchical concept retrieval benchmarks under resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web-based information systems in social sciences require advanced fine-tuning methods, but smaller institutions face computational and energy limitations for using methods like full fine-tuning.

Method: OrthoGeoLoRA is proposed as a PEFT approach that geometrically constrains low-rank factors on a Stiefel manifold, ensuring an SVD-like orthogonal form, compatible with standard optimization and existing pipelines.

Result: OrthoGeoLoRA outperforms standard LoRA and competitive PEFT methods on multilingual sentence encoders, especially in ranking tasks, within the same computational budget.

Conclusion: OrthoGeoLoRA offers a compute-efficient and effective methodology for adapting language models in resource-constrained contexts, beneficial for the Web4Good ecosystem.

Abstract: Large language models and text encoders increasingly power web-based information systems in the social sciences, including digital libraries, data catalogues, and search interfaces used by researchers, policymakers, and civil society. Full fine-tuning is often computationally and energy intensive, which can be prohibitive for smaller institutions and non-profit organizations in the Web4Good ecosystem. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces this cost by updating only a small number of parameters. We show that the standard LoRA update $ΔW = BA^\top$ has geometric drawbacks: gauge freedom, scale ambiguity, and a tendency toward rank collapse. We introduce OrthoGeoLoRA, which enforces an SVD-like form $ΔW = BΣA^\top$ by constraining the low-rank factors to be orthogonal (Stiefel manifold). A geometric reparameterization implements this constraint while remaining compatible with standard optimizers such as Adam and existing fine-tuning pipelines. We also propose a benchmark for hierarchical concept retrieval over the European Language Social Science Thesaurus (ELSST), widely used to organize social science resources in digital repositories. Experiments with a multilingual sentence encoder show that OrthoGeoLoRA outperforms standard LoRA and several strong PEFT variants on ranking metrics under the same low-rank budget, offering a more compute- and parameter-efficient path to adapt foundation models in resource-constrained settings.

*Tao Liu,Taiqiang Wu,Runming Yang,Shaoning Sun,Junjie Wang,Yujiu Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes ProFit, a strategy for supervised fine-tuning of language models by masking low-probability tokens to prevent overfitting to non-core expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address overfitting in supervised fine-tuning of large language models, where alignment is forced with a single reference answer, often ignoring the one-to-many nature of language.

Method: ProFit selectively masks low-probability tokens, as these tokens are identified as replaceable expressions, thus preserving alignment with the logical framework of language while restricting surface-level overfitting.

Result: ProFit consistently improves performance over traditional fine-tuning baselines, as shown through experiments on reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.

Conclusion: The selective masking strategy introduced by ProFit effectively mitigates the overfitting problem inherent in supervised fine-tuning of language models, enhancing alignment with human intent.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a fundamental post-training strategy to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent. However, traditional SFT often ignores the one-to-many nature of language by forcing alignment with a single reference answer, leading to the model overfitting to non-core expressions. Although our empirical analysis suggests that introducing multiple reference answers can mitigate this issue, the prohibitive data and computational costs necessitate a strategic shift: prioritizing the mitigation of single-reference overfitting over the costly pursuit of answer diversity. To achieve this, we reveal the intrinsic connection between token probability and semantic importance: high-probability tokens carry the core logical framework, while low-probability tokens are mostly replaceable expressions. Based on this insight, we propose ProFit, which selectively masks low-probability tokens to prevent surface-level overfitting. Extensive experiments confirm that ProFit consistently outperforms traditional SFT baselines on general reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel user simulator, UserLM-R1, designed for interactive agent training with reasoning capabilities, addressing limitations in generalizability and strategic thinking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome current user simulator limitations like static, context-unaware profiles and lack of human-like strategic capabilities.

Method: Developed UserLM-R1, featuring adaptive user profiles (static roles plus scenario-specific goals), a goal-driven decision-making policy for rationale generation, and strategic improvement using supervised fine-tuning and multi-reward reinforcement learning.

Result: UserLM-R1 outperformed competitive baselines, particularly in adversarial test settings, showcasing enhanced reasoning and adaptability.

Conclusion: UserLM-R1 establishes a more realistic and effective user simulator for interactive AI, significantly improving over existing models in generalizability and strategic engagement.

Abstract: User simulators serve as the critical interactive environment for agent post-training, and an ideal user simulator generalizes across domains and proactively engages in negotiation by challenging or bargaining. However, current methods exhibit two issues. They rely on static and context-unaware profiles, necessitating extensive manual redesign for new scenarios, thus limiting generalizability. Moreover, they neglect human strategic thinking, leading to vulnerability to agent manipulation. To address these issues, we propose UserLM-R1, a novel user language model with reasoning capability. Specifically, we first construct comprehensive user profiles with both static roles and dynamic scenario-specific goals for adaptation to diverse scenarios. Then, we propose a goal-driven decision-making policy to generate high-quality rationales before producing responses, and further refine the reasoning and improve strategic capabilities with supervised fine-tuning and multi-reward reinforcement learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that UserLM-R1 outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on the more challenging adversarial set.

TL;DR: The paper presents Ca2KG, a framework for better calibrating KG-RAG models by addressing their overconfidence issues while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KG-RAG models often suffer from overconfidence despite relying on incomplete or unreliable knowledge graphs, making them unsuitable for high-stakes domains.

Method: The authors introduce Ca2KG, which combines counterfactual prompting to reveal retrieval-based uncertainties and a panel-based re-scoring mechanism to stabilize predictions.

Result: Ca2KG improves calibration of KG-RAG models and enhances their predictive accuracy in experiments on two complex QA datasets.

Conclusion: By explicitly addressing overconfidence through counterfactual reasoning and re-scoring, Ca2KG makes KG-RAG more reliable for complex QA tasks with enhanced accuracy and stability.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) extends the RAG paradigm by incorporating structured knowledge from knowledge graphs, enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform more precise and explainable reasoning. While KG-RAG improves factual accuracy in complex tasks, existing KG-RAG models are often severely overconfident, producing high-confidence predictions even when retrieved sub-graphs are incomplete or unreliable, which raises concerns for deployment in high-stakes domains. To address this issue, we propose Ca2KG, a Causality-aware Calibration framework for KG-RAG. Ca2KG integrates counterfactual prompting, which exposes retrieval-dependent uncertainties in knowledge quality and reasoning reliability, with a panel-based re-scoring mechanism that stabilises predictions across interventions. Extensive experiments on two complex QA datasets demonstrate that Ca2KG consistently improves calibration while maintaining or even enhancing predictive accuracy.

*Xiangqian Wang,Yifan Jia,Yang Xiang,Yumin Zhang,Yanbin Wang,Ke Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TeachPro is a multi-label learning system for analyzing open-ended teaching feedback to assess key instructional dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for teaching evaluations are limited by low reliability and narrow analysis, often reducing feedback to binary sentiment extraction.

Method: TeachPro uses a Dimension-Anchored Evidence Encoder for contextualized teaching analysis and a Cross-View Graph Synergy Network to align syntactic and semantic feedback representations.

Result: TeachPro provides granular, robust teaching evaluations across five dimensions using a new benchmark dataset and advanced ML techniques.

Conclusion: TeachPro enhances instructional assessment by leveraging detailed multi-label feedback analysis, offering actionable improvement insights for educators.

Abstract: Standardized Student Evaluation of Teaching often suffer from low reliability, restricted response options, and response distortion. Existing machine learning methods that mine open-ended comments usually reduce feedback to binary sentiment, which overlooks concrete concerns such as content clarity, feedback timeliness, and instructor demeanor, and provides limited guidance for instructional improvement.We propose TeachPro, a multi-label learning framework that systematically assesses five key teaching dimensions: professional expertise, instructional behavior, pedagogical efficacy, classroom experience, and other performance metrics. We first propose a Dimension-Anchored Evidence Encoder, which integrates three core components: (i) a pre-trained text encoder that transforms qualitative feedback annotations into contextualized embeddings; (ii) a prompt module that represents five teaching dimensions as learnable semantic anchors; and (iii) a cross-attention mechanism that aligns evidence with pedagogical dimensions within a structured semantic space. We then propose a Cross-View Graph Synergy Network to represent student comments. This network comprises two components: (i) a Syntactic Branch that extracts explicit grammatical dependencies from parse trees, and (ii) a Semantic Branch that models latent conceptual relations derived from BERT-based similarity graphs. BiAffine fusion module aligns syntactic and semantic units, while a differential regularizer disentangles embeddings to encourage complementary representations. Finally, a cross-attention mechanism bridges the dimension-anchored evidence with the multi-view comment representations. We also contribute a novel benchmark dataset featuring expert qualitative annotations and multi-label scores. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TeachPro offers superior diagnostic granularity and robustness across diverse evaluation settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces FairToT, a framework that improves fairness in toxicity assessment by Large Language Models (LLMs) through inference-time prompt-guided methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of demographic-related biases and inconsistent toxicity judgments in LLM-based systems, thus ensuring fair and equitable assessments for online moderation.

Method: FairToT identifies bias-prone scenarios using interpretable fairness indicators and utilizes inference-time prompt-guided toxicity assessments to enhance reliability without altering model parameters.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets showed FairToT reduces group-level disparities while maintaining stable and consistent toxicity predictions.

Conclusion: Inference-time interventions, as demonstrated by FairToT, are an effective and practical way to improve fairness in LLM-based toxicity assessments without requiring changes in model parameters.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for toxicity assessment in online moderation systems, where fairness across demographic groups is essential for equitable treatment. However, LLMs often produce inconsistent toxicity judgements for subtle expressions, particularly those involving implicit hate speech, revealing underlying biases that are difficult to correct through standard training. This raises a key question that existing approaches often overlook: when should corrective mechanisms be invoked to ensure fair and reliable assessments? To address this, we propose FairToT, an inference-time framework that enhances LLM fairness through prompt-guided toxicity assessment. FairToT identifies cases where demographic-related variation is likely to occur and determines when additional assessment should be applied. In addition, we introduce two interpretable fairness indicators that detect such cases and improve inference consistency without modifying model parameters. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that FairToT reduces group-level disparities while maintaining stable and reliable toxicity predictions, demonstrating that inference-time refinement offers an effective and practical approach for fairness improvement in LLM-based toxicity assessment systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of exploration of audio corpora in Chinese Classical Studies and to enhance MLLMs with multidimensional audio capabilities.

Method: The authors develop MCGA, a multi-task audio corpus covering six tasks (ASR, S2TT, SEC, SQA, SU, SR), and assess ten MLLMs, creating new evaluation metrics.

Result: Experimental results indicate current MLLMs struggle with the MCGA dataset tasks. Novel metrics are proposed to assess speech-text consistency and SEC.

Conclusion: MCGA reveals significant challenges for MLLMs in audio tasks for CCS and offers a resource to propel future advancements. The corpus and its code have been made publicly available.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), their potential has garnered significant attention in Chinese Classical Studies (CCS). While existing research has primarily focused on text and visual modalities, the audio corpus within this domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multi-task Classical Chinese Literary Genre Audio Corpus (MCGA). It encompasses a diverse range of literary genres across six tasks: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT), Speech Emotion Captioning (SEC), Spoken Question Answering (SQA), Speech Understanding (SU), and Speech Reasoning (SR). Through the evaluation of ten MLLMs, our experimental results demonstrate that current models still face substantial challenges when processed on the MCGA test set. Furthermore, we introduce an evaluation metric for SEC and a metric to measure the consistency between the speech and text capabilities of MLLMs. We release MCGA and our code to the public to facilitate the development of MLLMs with more robust multidimensional audio capabilities in CCS.

*Chaerin Lee,Sohee Park,Hyunsik Na,Daseon Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReGraM, a region-first knowledge graph reasoning model, enhances accuracy and consistency in medical question answering by focusing only on relevant subgraphs rather than the entire knowledge graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical QA methods often rely on processing entire knowledge graphs, which brings noise and unstable reasoning. The paper aims to focus on relevant evidence subsets to enhance accuracy in medical question answering.

Method: It introduces ReGraM, a framework that creates a query-specific subgraph and reasons stepwise within this localized region under multiple evidence-aware modes. This differs from traditional methods handling entire graphs equally.

Result: ReGraM achieved significant improvements in accuracy across multiple benchmarks, with an 8.04% gain on MCQ, a 4.50% increase on SAQ, and a 42.9% hallucination rate reduction over the KGARevion baseline.

Conclusion: Region-focused KG reasoning, as employed by ReGraM, proves to be an effective approach in improving factual accuracy, reasoning stability, and consistency for medical QA systems.

Abstract: Recent studies in medical question answering (Medical QA) have actively explored the integration of large language models (LLMs) with biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) to improve factual accuracy. However, most existing approaches still rely on traversing the entire KG or performing large-scale retrieval, which introduces substantial noise and leads to unstable multi-hop reasoning. We argue that the core challenge lies not in expanding access to knowledge, but in identifying and reasoning over the appropriate subset of evidence for each query. ReGraM is a region-first knowledge graph reasoning framework that addresses this challenge by constructing a query-aligned subgraph and performing stepwise reasoning constrained to this localized region under multiple evidence aware modes. By focusing inference on only the most relevant portion of the KG, ReGraM departs from the assumption that all relations are equally useful an assumption that rarely holds in domain-specific medical settings. Experiments on seven medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that ReGraM consistently outperforms a strong baseline (KGARevion), achieving an 8.04% absolute accuracy gain on MCQ, a 4.50% gain on SAQ, and a 42.9% reduction in hallucination rate. Ablation and qualitative analyses further show that aligning region construction with hop-wise reasoning is the primary driver of these improvements. Overall, our results highlight region-first KG reasoning as an effective paradigm for improving factual accuracy and consistency in medical QA.

*Jonathan Drechsel,Erisa Bytyqi,Steffen Herbold*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines whether language models use rule-based generalization or memorization for German definite articles and finds evidence of memorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand whether language models encode grammatical rules abstractly or rely on memorized associations, particularly in the context of grammatical agreement.

Method: GRADIEND, a gradient-based interpretability method, is used to analyze parameter updates for gender-case specific article transitions in German definite articles.

Result: The findings show that updates learned for specific transitions affect unrelated gender-case transitions. There is significant overlap among affected neurons across settings.

Conclusion: The study concludes that language models do not encode German definite articles strictly based on grammatical rules but also depend on memorized associations.

Abstract: Language models perform well on grammatical agreement, but it is unclear whether this reflects rule-based generalization or memorization. We study this question for German definite singular articles, whose forms depend on gender and case. Using GRADIEND, a gradient-based interpretability method, we learn parameter update directions for gender-case specific article transitions. We find that updates learned for a specific gender-case article transition frequently affect unrelated gender-case settings, with substantial overlap among the most affected neurons across settings. These results argue against a strictly rule-based encoding of German definite articles, indicating that models at least partly rely on memorized associations rather than abstract grammatical rules.

*Ewelina Gajewska,Katarzyna Budzynska,Jarosław A Chudziak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new framework for detecting implicitly hateful speech using a multi-agent system with a Moderator Agent and Community Agents while incorporating socio-cultural context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting implicitly hateful speech in a way that incorporates socio-cultural context, thereby improving fairness and accuracy.

Method: A multi-agent system with a Moderator Agent and dynamically created Community Agents. It integrates socio-cultural context from public knowledge sources and evaluates performance using balanced accuracy for fairness.

Result: Their framework surpasses state-of-the-art prompting methods and enhances both accuracy and fairness on the ToxiGen dataset, particularly across different demographic groups.

Conclusion: The proposed consultative, community-driven framework effectively improves the accuracy and fairness of hateful speech detection through identity-aware and context-driven moderation.

Abstract: This work proposes a contextualised detection framework for implicitly hateful speech, implemented as a multi-agent system comprising a central Moderator Agent and dynamically constructed Community Agents representing specific demographic groups. Our approach explicitly integrates socio-cultural context from publicly available knowledge sources, enabling identity-aware moderation that surpasses state-of-the-art prompting methods (zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting) and alternative approaches on a challenging ToxiGen dataset. We enhance the technical rigour of performance evaluation by incorporating balanced accuracy as a central metric of classification fairness that accounts for the trade-off between true positive and true negative rates. We demonstrate that our community-driven consultative framework significantly improves both classification accuracy and fairness across all target groups.

*Biswesh Mohapatra,Théo Charlot,Giovanni Duca,Mayank Palan,Laurent Romary,Justine Cassell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the need for dialog systems to establish and use common ground in conversations, proposing methods to represent and enhance this capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving dialog systems to better establish and use common ground during conversations for coherent interactions.

Method: Evaluation of models for entity-based relational references and testing multiple representation methods of common ground, alongside proposed approaches to enhance its establishment and use.

Result: The study identifies methods to evaluate and improve models' ability to utilize common ground, enhancing conversational grounding acts.

Conclusion: Explicit mechanisms to represent and store common ground are essential for dialog systems to truly reflect a grounded understanding of conversational content.

Abstract: Common ground plays a critical role in situated spoken dialogues, where interlocutors must establish and maintain shared references to entities, events, and relations to sustain coherent interaction. For dialog systems, the ability to correctly ground conversational content in order to refer back to it later is particularly important. Prior studies have demonstrated that LLMs are capable of performing grounding acts such as requesting clarification or producing acknowledgments, yet relatively little work has investigated how common ground can be explicitly represented and stored for later use. Without such mechanisms, it remains unclear whether acknowledgment or clarification behaviors truly reflect a grounded understanding. In this work, we evaluate a model's ability to establish and exploit common ground through relational references to entities within the shared context in a situational dialogue. We test multiple methods for representing common ground in situated dialogues and further propose approaches to improve both the establishment of common ground and its subsequent use in the conversation.

*Aidana Aidynkyzy,Oğuz Dikenelli,Oylum Alatlı,Şebnem Bora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study conducts a bilingual evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for clinical relation extraction (RE) in English and Turkish, introducing a new dataset and proposing novel methods for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of annotated datasets in non-English languages, which limits the evaluation of LLMs for clinical information extraction. Specifically, it focuses on bilingual evaluation for English and Turkish.

Method: The authors created an English-Turkish parallel clinical RE dataset from the 2010 i2b2/VA relation classification corpus. They also assessed various prompting strategies, including innovative methods like Relation-Aware Retrieval (RAR), which leverages contrastive learning for better in-context example selection.

Result: Prompting-based LLMs performed better than fine-tuned models, with English evaluations outperforming Turkish counterparts. Among methods, RAR achieved the highest performance, with notable micro-F1 scores of 0.906 in English and 0.888 in Turkish. Combining RAR with structured reasoning further increased the English F1 score to 0.918.

Conclusion: High-quality example retrieval and advanced prompting techniques significantly enhance LLM performance for bilingual clinical NLP tasks, underlining their potential to address resource gaps in non-English languages.

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated datasets for clinical information extraction in non-English languages hinders the evaluation of large language model (LLM)-based methods developed primarily in English. In this study, we present the first comprehensive bilingual evaluation of LLMs for the clinical Relation Extraction (RE) task in both English and Turkish. To facilitate this evaluation, we introduce the first English-Turkish parallel clinical RE dataset, derived and carefully curated from the 2010 i2b2/VA relation classification corpus. We systematically assess a diverse set of prompting strategies, including multiple in-context learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches, and compare their performance to fine-tuned baselines such as PURE. Furthermore, we propose Relation-Aware Retrieval (RAR), a novel in-context example selection method based on contrastive learning, that is specifically designed to capture both sentence-level and relation-level semantics. Our results show that prompting-based LLM approaches consistently outperform traditional fine-tuned models. Moreover, evaluations for English performed better than their Turkish counterparts across all evaluated LLMs and prompting techniques. Among ICL methods, RAR achieves the highest performance, with Gemini 1.5 Flash reaching a micro-F1 score of 0.906 in English and 0.888 in Turkish. Performance further improves to 0.918 F1 in English when RAR is combined with a structured reasoning prompt using the DeepSeek-V3 model. These findings highlight the importance of high-quality demonstration retrieval and underscore the potential of advanced retrieval and prompting techniques to bridge resource gaps in clinical natural language processing.

### [78] [The Imperfective Paradox in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09373)
*Bolei Ma,Yusuke Miyao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether LLMs genuinely understand the compositional semantics of events or rely on heuristics, using a dataset (ImperfectiveNLI) to analyze the Imperfective Paradox and finding a teleological bias in models' reasoning about event completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Examine the extent of understanding exhibited by LLMs in logical reasoning and compositional semantics, focusing on the Imperfective Paradox to uncover potential biases and limitations in their design.

Method: They introduced a diagnostic dataset named ImperfectiveNLI to explore model behavior across semantic classes, performed representational analyses, and tested interventions like prompt-based strategies to manage biases.

Result: Models exhibit a teleological bias, such as hallucinating event completion despite explicit negation. While embeddings can differentiate processes from results, reasoning decisions prioritize completion biases. Prompt-based methods reduce hallucinations but introduce new errors.

Conclusion: Current LLMs fail to achieve structural awareness of the imperfective aspect, exposing their reliance on narrative prediction rather than logical compositional understanding.

Abstract: Do Large Language Models (LLMs) genuinely grasp the compositional semantics of events, or do they rely on surface-level probabilistic heuristics? We investigate the Imperfective Paradox, a logical phenomenon where the past progressive aspect entails event realization for activities (e.g., running $\to$ ran) but not for accomplishments (e.g., building $\nrightarrow$ built). We introduce ImperfectiveNLI, a diagnostic dataset designed to probe this distinction across diverse semantic classes. Evaluating state-of-the-art open-weight models, we uncover a pervasive Teleological Bias: models systematically hallucinate completion for goal-oriented events, often overriding explicit textual negation. Representational analyses show that while internal embeddings often distinguish process from result, inference decisions are dominated by strong priors about goal attainment. We further find that prompting-based interventions reduce hallucinated completions but also increase incorrect rejections of valid entailments. Our findings suggest that current LLMs lack structural aspectual awareness, operating as predictive narrative engines rather than faithful logical reasoners.

*Songyao Jin,Kun Zhou,Wenqi Li,Peng Wang,Biwei Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of catastrophic forgetting in specialized LLMs and introduces a method (ACT) to recover and integrate specialized abilities with minimal interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting and interference in language models when fine-tuning for specific domains or abilities.

Method: The proposed method, ACT, identifies and selectively transfers ability-relevant channels in the model's parameters using activation differences, followed by light fine-tuning for compatibility.

Result: ACT successfully recovers forgotten abilities and integrates multiple specialized models with minimal interference, showing effectiveness in multilingual mathematical and scientific reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: ACT demonstrates a way to retain, recover, and merge specialized abilities in LLMs, mitigating catastrophic forgetting and opening new avenues for efficient model specialization and integration.

Abstract: Large language models can be continually pre-trained or fine-tuned to improve performance in specific domains, languages, or skills, but this specialization often degrades other capabilities and may cause catastrophic forgetting. We investigate how abilities are distributed within LLM parameters by analyzing module activations under domain- and language-specific inputs for closely related models. Across layers and modules, we find that ability-related activations are highly concentrated in a small set of channels (typically <5\%), and these channels are largely disentangled with good sufficiency and stability. Building on these observations, we propose ACT (Activation-Guided Channel-wise Ability Transfer), which localizes ability-relevant channels via activation differences and selectively transfers only the corresponding parameters, followed by lightweight fine-tuning for compatibility. Experiments on multilingual mathematical and scientific reasoning show that ACT can recover forgotten abilities while preserving retained skills. It can also merge multiple specialized models to integrate several abilities into a single model with minimal interference. Our code and data will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PAGER, a framework enhancing RAG by generating structured pages of external knowledge for LLMs to support superior answer generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Iterative processes in RAG models lack organization, hindering cohesive knowledge representation and effective utilization of external knowledge.

Method: PAGER employs LLMs to construct structured cognitive outlines for queries, populating these with refined knowledge to create coherent pages as input for answer generation.

Result: PAGER surpasses RAG baselines in performance across benchmarks, providing high-quality, information-rich, conflict-free knowledge representations.

Conclusion: The PAGER framework showcases improved knowledge integration in LLMs, offering substantial benefits in handling complex queries by generating structured and comprehensive contextual inputs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. Recently, some works have incorporated iterative knowledge accumulation processes into RAG models to progressively accumulate and refine query-related knowledge, thereby constructing more comprehensive knowledge representations. However, these iterative processes often lack a coherent organizational structure, which limits the construction of more comprehensive and cohesive knowledge representations. To address this, we propose PAGER, a page-driven autonomous knowledge representation framework for RAG. PAGER first prompts an LLM to construct a structured cognitive outline for a given question, which consists of multiple slots representing a distinct knowledge aspect. Then, PAGER iteratively retrieves and refines relevant documents to populate each slot, ultimately constructing a coherent page that serves as contextual input for guiding answer generation. Experiments on multiple knowledge-intensive benchmarks and backbone models show that PAGER consistently outperforms all RAG baselines. Further analyses demonstrate that PAGER constructs higher-quality and information-dense knowledge representations, better mitigates knowledge conflicts, and enables LLMs to leverage external knowledge more effectively.

### [81] [Bias Dynamics in BabyLMs: Towards a Compute-Efficient Sandbox for Democratising Pre-Training Debiasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09421)
*Filip Trhlik,Andrew Caines,Paula Buttery*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BabyLMs, small and cost-efficient models, as proxies for studying and mitigating bias in large pre-trained language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high costs and inefficiencies in retraining large pre-trained language models for debiasing purposes and to enable accessible methods for bias research.

Method: The authors use BabyLMs, lightweight BERT-like models, trained on smaller datasets to study bias acquisition and dynamics. They compare these models to standard BERTs across various metrics and debiasing approaches.

Result: BabyLMs effectively mirror bias patterns and learning dynamics of larger LMs. They successfully replicate results from prior debiasing studies, highlighting their potential in reducing research costs while deriving valuable insights.

Conclusion: BabyLMs can democratize bias mitigation research while drastically lowering the computational costs and enabling deeper and fairer explorations into language model improvement.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (LMs) have, over the last few years, grown substantially in both societal adoption and training costs. This rapid growth in size has constrained progress in understanding and mitigating their biases. Since re-training LMs is prohibitively expensive, most debiasing work has focused on post-hoc or masking-based strategies, which often fail to address the underlying causes of bias. In this work, we seek to democratise pre-model debiasing research by using low-cost proxy models. Specifically, we investigate BabyLMs, compact BERT-like models trained on small and mutable corpora that can approximate bias acquisition and learning dynamics of larger models. We show that BabyLMs display closely aligned patterns of intrinsic bias formation and performance development compared to standard BERT models, despite their drastically reduced size. Furthermore, correlations between BabyLMs and BERT hold across multiple intra-model and post-model debiasing methods. Leveraging these similarities, we conduct pre-model debiasing experiments with BabyLMs, replicating prior findings and presenting new insights regarding the influence of gender imbalance and toxicity on bias formation. Our results demonstrate that BabyLMs can serve as an effective sandbox for large-scale LMs, reducing pre-training costs from over 500 GPU-hours to under 30 GPU-hours. This provides a way to democratise pre-model debiasing research and enables faster, more accessible exploration of methods for building fairer LMs.

*Minh Vu Pham,Hsuvas Borkakoty,Yufang Hou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates intra-memory knowledge conflicts in language models and how they arise during pre-training, presenting a framework to identify and mitigate these conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover and address knowledge conflicts within a language model's parametric knowledge that arise during pre-training, as prior approaches mainly emphasize resolving external conflicts.

Method: A framework based on mechanistic interpretability methods was developed to locate and analyze the points of conflict within a language model's internal knowledge representations.

Result: The study showed that specific internal components of language models are responsible for encoding conflicting pre-training knowledge, and mechanistic methods can help manage these conflicts during inference.

Conclusion: Mechanistic interpretability methods provide an effective way to identify and control pre-training conflicts within language models, improving knowledge coherence and inference reliability.

Abstract: In language models (LMs), intra-memory knowledge conflict largely arises when inconsistent information about the same event is encoded within the model's parametric knowledge. While prior work has primarily focused on resolving conflicts between a model's internal knowledge and external resources through approaches such as fine-tuning or knowledge editing, the problem of localizing conflicts that originate during pre-training within the model's internal representations remain unexplored. In this work, we design a framework based on mechanistic interpretability methods to identify where and how conflicting knowledge from the pre-training data is encoded within LMs. Our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that specific internal components of a language model are responsible for encoding conflicting knowledge from pre-training, and we demonstrate how mechanistic interpretability methods can be leveraged to causally intervene in and control conflicting knowledge at inference time.

### [83] [Improving Symbolic Translation of Language Models for Logical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09446)
*Ramya Keerthy Thatikonda,Jiuzhou Han,Wray Buntine,Ehsan Shareghi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces techniques to improve smaller language models in translating natural language to first-order logic, enhancing their reasoning and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smaller language models often fail in translating natural language to accurate first-order logic representations due to formatting and translation errors, preventing efficient deductive reasoning.

Method: Common translation errors are categorized, smaller models are fine-tuned using synthesized data, and incremental inference is proposed alongside a verification module to improve model reliability.

Result: Error rates are reduced, predicate coverage is increased, and reasoning performance is improved across logical-reasoning datasets for smaller language models.

Conclusion: The proposed strategies enhance reasoning quality and reliability of smaller language models, making symbolic-reasoning systems more accessible and practical.

Abstract: The use of formal language for deductive logical reasoning aligns well with language models (LMs), where translating natural language (NL) into first-order logic (FOL) and employing an external solver results in a verifiable and therefore reliable reasoning system. However, smaller LMs often struggle with this translation task, frequently producing incorrect symbolic outputs due to formatting and translation errors. Existing approaches typically rely on self-iteration to correct these errors, but such methods depend heavily on the capabilities of the underlying model. To address this, we first categorize common errors and fine-tune smaller LMs using data synthesized by large language models. The evaluation is performed using the defined error categories. We introduce incremental inference, which divides inference into two stages, predicate generation and FOL translation, providing greater control over model behavior and enhancing generation quality as measured by predicate metrics. This decomposition framework also enables the use of a verification module that targets predicate-arity errors to further improve performance. Our study evaluates three families of models across four logical-reasoning datasets. The comprehensive fine-tuning, incremental inference, and verification modules reduce error rates, increase predicate coverage, and improve reasoning performance for smaller LMs, moving us closer to developing reliable and accessible symbolic-reasoning systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SlidesGen-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating automated slide generation systems effectively through unified metrics and human preference alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating automated slide generation are inadequate, presenting challenges in standardization, reliable scoring, and alignment with human preferences.

Method: The authors developed a benchmark focusing on universality, quantification, and reliability by evaluating outputs visually, proposing quantitative metrics for measuring content, aesthetics, and editability, and constructing a human preference-aligned dataset.

Result: SlidesGen-Bench demonstrates improved alignment with human judgments when evaluating slide generation systems, outperforming existing evaluation methods.

Conclusion: SlidesGen-Bench provides a more standardized, quantitative, and human-aligned framework for evaluating heterogeneous slide generation systems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has fostered diverse paradigms for automated slide generation, ranging from code-driven layouts to image-centric synthesis. However, evaluating these heterogeneous systems remains challenging, as existing protocols often struggle to provide comparable scores across architectures or rely on uncalibrated judgments. In this paper, we introduce SlidesGen-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate slide generation through a lens of three core principles: universality, quantification, and reliability. First, to establish a unified evaluation framework, we ground our analysis in the visual domain, treating terminal outputs as renderings to remain agnostic to the underlying generation method. Second, we propose a computational approach that quantitatively assesses slides across three distinct dimensions - Content, Aesthetics, and Editability - offering reproducible metrics where prior works relied on subjective or reference-dependent proxies. Finally, to ensure high correlation with human preference, we construct the Slides-Align1.5k dataset, a human preference aligned dataset covering slides from nine mainstream generation systems across seven scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that SlidesGen-Bench achieves a higher degree of alignment with human judgment than existing evaluation pipelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes MVSS, a framework for structured survey generation using hierarchical trees, comparison tables, and survey text, addressing gaps in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing survey generation methods lack explicit hierarchical organization and structured comparisons, making them less coherent and complete compared to expert-written surveys.

Method: MVSS adopts a structure-first paradigm, creating a conceptual tree, comparison tables aligned with the tree, and generating citation-grounded narrative text based on these structures.

Result: Experimental results on 76 computer science topics show that MVSS outperforms current methods in structural organization and evidence grounding, achieving expert-level performance.

Conclusion: MVSS provides a robust, multi-view framework for structured survey generation, improving organization and fidelity over existing methods.

Abstract: Scientific surveys require not only summarizing large bodies of literature, but also organizing them into clear and coherent conceptual structures. Existing automatic survey generation methods typically focus on linear text generation and struggle to explicitly model hierarchical relations among research topics and structured methodological comparisons, resulting in gaps in structural organization compared to expert-written surveys. We propose MVSS, a multi-view structured survey generation framework that jointly generates and aligns citation-grounded hierarchical trees, structured comparison tables, and survey text. MVSS follows a structure-first paradigm: it first constructs a conceptual tree of the research domain, then generates comparison tables constrained by the tree, and finally uses both as structural constraints for text generation. This enables complementary multi-view representations across structure, comparison, and narrative. We introduce an evaluation framework assessing structural quality, comparative completeness, and citation fidelity. Experiments on 76 computer science topics show MVSS outperforms existing methods in organization and evidence grounding, achieving performance comparable to expert surveys.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Self-Evolving Relevance Model (SERM) to address challenges of identifying informative samples and generating reliable pseudo-labels in large-scale query streams, showing significant performance improvements in extensive evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Relevance models struggle with generalizing to dynamic real-world query streams, and self-evolution techniques face issues identifying sparse informative samples and unreliable pseudo-labels in large-scale industrial contexts.

Method: The SERM approach includes two key multi-agent modules: a sample miner for detecting distributional shifts and identifying informative samples, and a relevance annotator that produces reliable labels using a two-level agreement strategy.

Result: SERM demonstrated significant performance improvements in a large-scale industrial setting serving billions of requests daily. This was validated through comprehensive offline multilingual evaluations and online testing.

Conclusion: SERM effectively addresses challenges in query relevance for dynamic, large-scale settings by utilizing self-evolution techniques, leading to measurable performance gains in practical applications.

Abstract: Due to the dynamically evolving nature of real-world query streams, relevance models struggle to generalize to practical search scenarios. A sophisticated solution is self-evolution techniques. However, in large-scale industrial settings with massive query streams, this technique faces two challenges: (1) informative samples are often sparse and difficult to identify, and (2) pseudo-labels generated by the current model could be unreliable. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose a Self-Evolving Relevance Model approach (SERM), which comprises two complementary multi-agent modules: a multi-agent sample miner, designed to detect distributional shifts and identify informative training samples, and a multi-agent relevance annotator, which provides reliable labels through a two-level agreement framework. We evaluate SERM in a large-scale industrial setting, which serves billions of user requests daily. Experimental results demonstrate that SERM can achieve significant performance gains through iterative self-evolution, as validated by extensive offline multilingual evaluations and online testing.

TL;DR: This paper systematically investigates post-training quantization (PTQ) algorithms under Microscaling Floating-Point formats (MXFP), analyzing their efficacy across MXFP8 and MXFP4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap in understanding the effectiveness and behavior of PTQ under the emerging Microscaling Floating-Point formats (MXFP), especially compared to integer quantization approaches.

Method: The research evaluates 7 PTQ algorithms across 15 benchmarks and 3 language model families, examining quantization sensitivity, format compatibility, and error sources, while introducing a pre-scaling optimization strategy.

Result: MXFP8 performs with minimal accuracy loss, while MXFP4 suffers significant degradation. Algorithm compatibility with MXFP formats varies, and quantization trends are consistent across model families. Pre-scaling optimization mitigates scaling factor errors in MXFP4.

Conclusion: The findings offer practical guidance for PTQ adaptation to MXFP formats, with strategies to enhance performance, especially for challenge-prone MXFP4 quantization.

Abstract: Microscaling Floating-Point (MXFP) has emerged as a promising low-precision format for large language models (LLMs). Despite various post-training quantization (PTQ) algorithms being proposed, they mostly focus on integer quantization, while their applicability and behavior under MXFP formats remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, this work conducts a systematic investigation of PTQ under MXFP formats, encompassing over 7 PTQ algorithms, 15 evaluation benchmarks, and 3 LLM families. The key findings include: 1) MXFP8 consistently achieves near-lossless performance, while MXFP4 introduces substantial accuracy degradation and remains challenging; 2) PTQ effectiveness under MXFP depends strongly on format compatibility, with some algorithmic paradigms being consistently more effective than others; 3) PTQ performance exhibits highly consistent trends across model families and modalities, in particular, quantization sensitivity is dominated by the language model rather than the vision encoder in multimodal LLMs; 4) The scaling factor of quantization is a critical error source in MXFP4, and a simple pre-scale optimization strategy can significantly mitigate its impact. Together, these results provide practical guidance on adapting existing PTQ methods to MXFP quantization.

*Dimitris Panagopoulos,Adolfo Perrusquia,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents Dialogue Telemetry (DT), a framework for monitoring and enhancing dialogue efficiency in autonomous systems through two signals: Progress Estimator and Stalling Index.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous systems lack effective tools to monitor dialogue efficiency and detect unproductive questioning during information-gathering tasks.

Method: The authors developed DT, which uses a Progress Estimator to assess residual information potential and a Stalling Index to detect stalled dialogues based on repetitive probing with low-value responses.

Result: DT was validated in simulations inspired by search-and-rescue interviews with large language models, proving its ability to distinguish efficient dialogues and improve reinforcement learning policy performance.

Conclusion: Dialogue Telemetry enables interpretable, turn-level monitoring for autonomous systems, enhancing decision-making and efficiency, especially in scenarios where stalling incurs operational costs.

Abstract: Autonomous systems conducting schema-grounded information-gathering dialogues face an instrumentation gap, lacking turn-level observables for monitoring acquisition efficiency and detecting when questioning becomes unproductive. We introduce Dialogue Telemetry (DT), a measurement framework that produces two model-agnostic signals after each question-answer exchange: (i) a Progress Estimator (PE) quantifying residual information potential per category (with a bits-based variant), and (ii) a Stalling Index (SI) detecting an observable failure signature characterized by repeated category probing with semantically similar, low-marginal-gain responses. SI flags this pattern without requiring causal diagnosis, supporting monitoring in settings where attributing degradation to specific causes may be impractical. We validate DT in controlled search-and-rescue (SAR)-inspired interviews using large language model (LLM)-based simulations, distinguishing efficient from stalled dialogue traces and illustrating downstream utility by integrating DT signals into a reinforcement learning (RL) policy. Across these settings, DT provides interpretable turn-level instrumentation that improves policy performance when stalling carries operational costs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an RL framework with a Chain-of-Thought structure to improve output diversity in large language models (LLMs) for creative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs tend to lose diversity in open-ended tasks like creative writing when enhanced by existing RL methods, which lack explicit mechanisms to encourage diverse exploration.

Method: The authors propose a semi-structured Chain-of-Thought framework coupled with a Diverse Planning Branching method and a group-aware diversity reward.

Result: Experiments on creative writing benchmarks show significant improvements in output diversity while maintaining generation quality, surpassing current methods.

Conclusion: The introduced framework effectively enhances output diversity in creative LLM tasks, addressing challenges in current RL approaches and outperforming baselines.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based enhancement of large language models (LLMs) often leads to reduced output diversity, undermining their utility in open-ended tasks like creative writing. Current methods lack explicit mechanisms for guiding diverse exploration and instead prioritize optimization efficiency and performance over diversity. This paper proposes an RL framework structured around a semi-structured long Chain-of-Thought (CoT), in which the generation process is decomposed into explicitly planned intermediate steps. We introduce a Diverse Planning Branching method that strategically introduces divergence at the planning phase based on diversity variation, alongside a group-aware diversity reward to encourage distinct trajectories. Experimental results on creative writing benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves output diversity without compromising generation quality, consistently outperforming existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses rhyme detection and generation challenges in Modern Greek using a hybrid system combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and deterministic phonological algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with phonologically-grounded phenomena like rhyme in lower-resource languages such as Modern Greek. The paper aims to improve rhyme identification/analysis and generation.

Method: A hybrid system is developed, implementing a taxonomy of Greek rhyme types and using phonological verification within the agentic generation pipeline. Various prompting strategies are evaluated across multiple LLMs.

Result: Chain-of-Thought prompting improves performance, with reasoning-heavy models achieving up to 54% accuracy in rhyme identification. Pure LLM generation struggles (4% valid poems), but the hybrid verification loop significantly improves generation accuracy to 73.1%.

Conclusion: LLMs can benefit greatly from hybrid systems and phonological algorithms to tackle phonologically complex tasks, enabling enhanced performance in rhyme-related processes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities across NLP tasks, struggle with phonologically-grounded phenomena like rhyme detection and generation. This is even more evident in lower-resource languages such as Modern Greek. In this paper, we present a hybrid system that combines LLMs with deterministic phonological algorithms to achieve accurate rhyme identification/analysis and generation. Our approach implements a comprehensive taxonomy of Greek rhyme types, including Pure, Rich, Imperfect, Mosaic, and Identical Pre-rhyme Vowel (IDV) patterns, and employs an agentic generation pipeline with phonological verification. We evaluate multiple prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, and RAG-augmented) across several LLMs including Claude 3.7 and 4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 and open-weight models like Llama 3.1 8B and 70B and Mistral Large. Results reveal a significant "Reasoning Gap": while native-like models (Claude 3.7) perform intuitively (40\% accuracy in identification), reasoning-heavy models (Claude 4.5) achieve state-of-the-art performance (54\%) only when prompted with Chain-of-Thought. Most critically, pure LLM generation fails catastrophically (under 4\% valid poems), while our hybrid verification loop restores performance to 73.1\%. We release our system and a crucial, rigorously cleaned corpus of 40,000+ rhymes, derived from the Anemoskala and Interwar Poetry corpora, to support future research.

### [91] [TaxoBell: Gaussian Box Embeddings for Self-Supervised Taxonomy Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09633)
*Sahil Mishra,Srinitish Srinivasan,Srikanta Bedathur,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TaxoBell, a Gaussian box embedding framework for taxonomy expansion, addressing issues of traditional methods and outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual taxonomy expansion is labor-intensive, and existing automated methods fail to model asymmetric 'is-a' relationships fundamental to taxonomies.

Method: TaxoBell utilizes Gaussian box embeddings, which translate geometries to multivariate Gaussian distributions, optimized using energy-based approaches.

Result: TaxoBell improves taxonomy expansion performance, outperforming eight baselines with a 19% MRR increase and a 25% rise in Recall@k across five datasets.

Conclusion: TaxoBell enhances taxonomy modeling, tackling shortcomings in previous methods and showcasing robustness and interpretability through experiments and analyses.

Abstract: Taxonomies form the backbone of structured knowledge representation across diverse domains, enabling applications such as e-commerce catalogs, semantic search, and biomedical discovery. Yet, manual taxonomy expansion is labor-intensive and cannot keep pace with the emergence of new concepts. Existing automated methods rely on point-based vector embeddings, which model symmetric similarity and thus struggle with the asymmetric "is-a" relationships that are fundamental to taxonomies. Box embeddings offer a promising alternative by enabling containment and disjointness, but they face key issues: (i) unstable gradients at the intersection boundaries, (ii) no notion of semantic uncertainty, and (iii) limited capacity to represent polysemy or ambiguity. We address these shortcomings with TaxoBell, a Gaussian box embedding framework that translates between box geometries and multivariate Gaussian distributions, where means encode semantic location and covariances encode uncertainty. Energy-based optimization yields stable optimization, robust modeling of ambiguous concepts, and interpretable hierarchical reasoning. Extensive experimentation on five benchmark datasets demonstrates that TaxoBell significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art taxonomy expansion baselines by 19% in MRR and around 25% in Recall@k. We further demonstrate the advantages and pitfalls of TaxoBell with error analysis and ablation studies.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the USAS framework for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) in multiple languages by analyzing rule-based and neural network approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There has been no extensive evaluation of the USAS framework for WSD beyond lexical coverage or single language setups, prompting thorough evaluation across multiple languages and neural approaches.

Method: The study evaluates the USAS framework in five languages using four existing datasets and a novel Chinese dataset. It introduces a new silver-labeled English dataset, trains neural models, and compares them with rule-based counterparts.

Result: The evaluation demonstrates the potential improvement of rule-based systems with neural models, while releasing trained models, datasets, and code as open resources.

Conclusion: The integration of rule-based systems with neural network models enhances WSD accuracy and resources, providing valuable contributions to multilingual semantic tagging.

Abstract: Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) has been widely evaluated using the semantic frameworks of WordNet, BabelNet, and the Oxford Dictionary of English. However, for the UCREL Semantic Analysis System (USAS) framework, no open extensive evaluation has been performed beyond lexical coverage or single language evaluation. In this work, we perform the largest semantic tagging evaluation of the rule based system that uses the lexical resources in the USAS framework covering five different languages using four existing datasets and one novel Chinese dataset. We create a new silver labelled English dataset, to overcome the lack of manually tagged training data, that we train and evaluate various mono and multilingual neural models in both mono and cross-lingual evaluation setups with comparisons to their rule based counterparts, and show how a rule based system can be enhanced with a neural network model. The resulting neural network models, including the data they were trained on, the Chinese evaluation dataset, and all of the code have been released as open resources.

TL;DR: DeepResearchEval creates realistic research tasks and dynamically evaluates agents' performance using adaptive quality criteria and active fact-checking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving evaluation frameworks for multi-step, cross-source research systems by addressing annotation difficulty and static evaluation limitations.

Method: DeepResearchEval uses a persona-driven pipeline for task construction and an agentic evaluation pipeline with dynamic quality criteria and fact-checking techniques.

Result: Enhanced task realism and reliable evaluation methodologies for deep research systems, improving verification even without citations.

Conclusion: DeepResearchEval provides a robust approach for assessing multi-step research systems, aiding accurate analysis and synthesis of external data sources.

Abstract: Deep research systems are widely used for multi-step web research, analysis, and cross-source synthesis, yet their evaluation remains challenging. Existing benchmarks often require annotation-intensive task construction, rely on static evaluation dimensions, or fail to reliably verify facts when citations are missing. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DeepResearchEval, an automated framework for deep research task construction and agentic evaluation. For task construction, we propose a persona-driven pipeline generating realistic, complex research tasks anchored in diverse user profiles, applying a two-stage filter Task Qualification and Search Necessity to retain only tasks requiring multi-source evidence integration and external retrieval. For evaluation, we propose an agentic pipeline with two components: an Adaptive Point-wise Quality Evaluation that dynamically derives task-specific evaluation dimensions, criteria, and weights conditioned on each generated task, and an Active Fact-Checking that autonomously extracts and verifies report statements via web search, even when citations are missing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Routing with Generated Data (RGD), a method to train model routers using entirely generated data, highlighting the development of CASCAL, a robust query-only router.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for effective LLM routing in scenarios where ground-truth labeled data is unavailable due to heterogeneous and unpredictable request distributions.

Method: Developed and evaluated query-answer and query-only routers. Proposed CASCAL, a query-only router, that uses consensus voting and hierarchical clustering for robustness to generator quality.

Result: CASCAL outperforms existing query-answer routers in accuracy by 4.6% using weak generator data, proving higher robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that query-only routers like CASCAL are more resilient to degraded generator quality, making them suitable for practical implementation where labeled data is inaccessible or sparse.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routers dynamically select optimal models for given inputs. Existing approaches typically assume access to ground-truth labeled data, which is often unavailable in practice, especially when user request distributions are heterogeneous and unknown. We introduce Routing with Generated Data (RGD), a challenging setting in which routers are trained exclusively on generated queries and answers produced from high-level task descriptions by generator LLMs. We evaluate query-answer routers (using both queries and labels) and query-only routers across four diverse benchmarks and 12 models, finding that query-answer routers degrade faster than query-only routers as generator quality decreases. Our analysis reveals two crucial characteristics of effective generators: they must accurately respond to their own questions, and their questions must produce sufficient performance differentiation among the model pool. We then show how filtering for these characteristics can improve the quality of generated data. We further propose CASCAL, a novel query-only router that estimates model correctness through consensus voting and identifies model-specific skill niches via hierarchical clustering. CASCAL is substantially more robust to generator quality, outperforming the best query-answer router by 4.6% absolute accuracy when trained on weak generator data.

### [95] [LLMs can Compress LLMs: Adaptive Pruning by Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09694)
*Sai Varun Kodathala,Rakesh Vunnam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) often face performance issues with pruning methods. This paper proposes an agent-guided pruning technique that intelligently identifies layers to prune using foundation models, improving computational efficiency and preserving critical knowledge pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce computational costs of scaling LLMs through pruning while addressing issues like factual knowledge loss and poor performance commonly associated with current structured pruning methods.

Method: The paper introduces an agent-guided pruning method where a foundation model acts as an intelligent agent. The agent uses sensitivity profiles to decide on pruning strategies, which combine Wanda-based metrics with gradient importance. A checkpoint rollback mechanism prevents quality degradation and allows iterative self-correction.

Result: The proposed method achieves a 56% improvement in MMLU accuracy, retains 19x more factual knowledge on FreebaseQA, and reduces perplexity degradation by 69% on Qwen3 models (4B and 8B) at approximately 45% sparsity—all without retraining.

Conclusion: The approach proves that a foundation model can guide the effective compression of another foundation model in a model-agnostic manner, with minimal rollbacks required. It significantly outperforms existing pruning baselines and offers a practical, adaptive solution to compress LLMs while preserving their core functionalities.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to scale, post-training pruning has emerged as a promising approach to reduce computational costs while preserving performance. Existing methods such as SparseGPT and Wanda achieve high sparsity through layer-wise weight reconstruction or activation-aware magnitude pruning, but rely on uniform or hand-crafted heuristics to determine per-layer sparsity ratios. Moreover, recent work has shown that pruned LLMs suffer from severe factual knowledge degradation, with structured pruning methods experiencing near-total collapse in factual question-answering capabilities. We introduce agent-guided pruning, where a foundation model acts as an adaptive pruning agent to intelligently select which layers to prune at each iteration while preserving critical knowledge pathways. Our method constructs layer-wise sensitivity profiles by combining Wanda-inspired weight-activation metrics with gradient importance scores, normalized as z-scores for model-agnostic comparison. These statistics are processed by an LLM agent equipped with self-reflection capabilities, enabling it to learn from previous pruning outcomes and iteratively refine its strategy. A checkpoint rollback mechanism maintains model quality by reverting when perplexity degradation exceeds a threshold. We evaluate our approach on Qwen3 models (4B and 8B parameters) at approximately 45% sparsity, demonstrating substantial improvements over structured pruning baselines: 56% relative improvement in MMLU accuracy, 19x better factual knowledge retention on FreebaseQA, and 69% lower perplexity degradation. Notably, our framework requires no retraining, operates in a model-agnostic manner, and exhibits effective self-correction with only 2-4 rollbacks across 21-40 iterations, demonstrating that foundation models can effectively guide the compression of other foundation models.

*Shan Randhawa,Agha Ali Raza,Kentaro Toyama,Julie Hui,Mustafa Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Empathy Applicability Framework (EAF) for classifying patient queries based on empathy needs and introduces a benchmark dataset with strong human and GPT alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of clinical empathy in large language models (LLMs) used in healthcare, focusing specifically on the anticipatory modeling of empathy in general patient queries.

Method: Developing the EAF, based on linguistic, contextual, and clinical cues, coupled with benchmark data annotated by humans and GPT-4o. Empathy applicability classifiers were validated against alternative baselines.

Result: Classifiers trained on EAF outperformed heuristic and zero-shot LLM baselines. Human and GPT annotations showed substantial alignment, though challenges like implicit distress and cultural diversity persist.

Conclusion: EAF is a robust approach for anticipating empathy needs, improving empathetic communication in healthcare, and emphasizes the importance of multi-annotator and culturally diverse strategies.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly being integrated into clinical workflows, yet they often lack clinical empathy, an essential aspect of effective doctor-patient communication. Existing NLP frameworks focus on reactively labeling empathy in doctors' responses but offer limited support for anticipatory modeling of empathy needs, especially in general health queries. We introduce the Empathy Applicability Framework (EAF), a theory-driven approach that classifies patient queries in terms of the applicability of emotional reactions and interpretations, based on clinical, contextual, and linguistic cues. We release a benchmark of real patient queries, dual-annotated by Humans and GPT-4o. In the subset with human consensus, we also observe substantial human-GPT alignment. To validate EAF, we train classifiers on human-labeled and GPT-only annotations to predict empathy applicability, achieving strong performance and outperforming the heuristic and zero-shot LLM baselines. Error analysis highlights persistent challenges: implicit distress, clinical-severity ambiguity, and contextual hardship, underscoring the need for multi-annotator modeling, clinician-in-the-loop calibration, and culturally diverse annotation. EAF provides a framework for identifying empathy needs before response generation, establishes a benchmark for anticipatory empathy modeling, and enables supporting empathetic communication in asynchronous healthcare.

*Andreea Dutulescu,Stefan Ruseti,Mihai Dascalu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a numerical representation in language models to improve their arithmetic capabilities by explicitly encoding numerical values, enhancing robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address systematic errors and limitations in numerical understanding and arithmetic caused by symbolic token representations in language models.

Method: Introduce a numerical representation with prefix tokens embedding numerical value, compatible with tokenizers and decoder Transformer architectures.

Result: The approach outperforms baselines in arithmetic tasks across formats, tasks, and operand lengths.

Conclusion: Explicitly encoding numerical value significantly enhances numerical robustness in Transformer-based language models.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models often achieve strong results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks while remaining fragile on basic numerical understanding and arithmetic operations. A central limitation is that numbers are processed as symbolic tokens whose embeddings do not explicitly encode numerical value, leading to systematic errors. We introduce a value-aware numerical representation that augments standard tokenized inputs with a dedicated prefix token whose embedding is explicitly conditioned on the underlying numerical value. This mechanism injects magnitude information directly into the model's input space while remaining compatible with existing tokenizers and decoder-only Transformer architectures. Evaluation on arithmetic tasks shows that the proposed approach outperforms baselines across numerical formats, tasks, and operand lengths. These results indicate that explicitly encoding numerical value is an effective and efficient way to improve fundamental numerical robustness in language models.

*Yufeng Zhong,Lei Chen,Zhixiong Zeng,Xuanle Zhao,Deyang Jiang,Liming Zheng,Jing Huang,Haibo Qiu,Peng Shi,Siqi Yang,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses OCR models facing challenges in processing formatted text and proposes a solution using Format Decoupled Reinforcement Learning (FD-RL), achieving state-of-the-art performance on OmniDocBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OCR models struggle with processing formatted text (e.g., formulas, tables) due to high entropy and uncertainty, highlighting the need for a solution that improves performance in format-sensitive scenarios.

Method: The authors propose Format Decoupled Reinforcement Learning (FD-RL), which involves entropy-based data filtration and format-specific rewards to optimize performance in processing formatted text.

Result: FD-RL achieved a new record score of 90.41 on OmniDocBench, validating its effectiveness through comprehensive ablation studies.

Conclusion: FD-RL successfully enhances OCR models' performance in handling format-sensitive documents, offering a significant improvement over existing methods.

Abstract: Reading text from images or scanned documents via OCR models has been a longstanding focus of researchers. Intuitively, text reading is perceived as a straightforward perceptual task, and existing work primarily focuses on constructing enriched data engineering to enhance SFT capabilities. In this work, we observe that even advanced OCR models exhibit significantly higher entropy in formatted text (\emph{e.g.}, formula, table, etc.) compared to plain text, often by an order of magnitude. These statistical patterns reveal that advanced OCR models struggle with high output uncertainty when dealing with format sensitive document, suggesting that reasoning over diverse reading pathways may improve OCR performance. To address this, we propose format decoupled reinforcement learning (FD-RL), which leverages high-entropy patterns for targeted optimization. Our approach employs entropy-based data filtration strategy to identify format-intensive instances, and adopt format decoupled rewards tailored to different format types, enabling format-level validation rather than token-level memorization. FD-RL achieves an average score of 90.41 on OmniDocBench, setting a new record for end-to-end models on this highly popular benchmark. More importantly, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies over data, training, filtering, and rewarding strategies, thoroughly validating their effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the insufficient exploration of robustness and fairness in VLMs and generative models under input transformations, focusing on bias propagation and degradation caused by rotation and distributional shifts.

Method: The authors propose rotation-robust mitigation strategies combining data augmentation, representation alignment, and model-level regularization to tackle robustness and fairness issues.

Result: The methods significantly enhance robustness and reduce bias amplification without compromising overall performance, as shown through experiments on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The study identifies critical limitations in multimodal systems and offers practical solutions to build more reliable and fair AI models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and generative image models have achieved remarkable performance across multimodal tasks, yet their robustness and fairness under input transformations remain insufficiently explored. This work investigates bias propagation and robustness degradation in state-of-the-art vision-language and generative models, with a particular focus on image rotation and distributional shifts. We analyze how rotation-induced perturbations affect model predictions, confidence calibration, and demographic bias patterns. To address these issues, we propose rotation-robust mitigation strategies that combine data augmentation, representation alignment, and model-level regularization. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve robustness while reducing bias amplification without sacrificing overall performance. This study highlights critical limitations of current multimodal systems and provides practical mitigation techniques for building more reliable and fair AI models.

*Qingyu Liu,Zhongjie Ba,Jianmin Guo,Qiu Wang,Zhibo Wang,Jie Shi,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces R$^2$BD, a faster and more accurate fake image detection framework that generalizes across various generative paradigms (e.g., VAEs, GANs, diffusion models) and performs significantly faster than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiency and limited generalization capabilities of current reconstruction-based fake image detection methods that heavily rely on diffusion backbones and multi-step processes.

Method: R$^2$BD consists of: (1) G-LDM, a unified reconstruction model handling inputs from different generative models; and (2) a single-step residual bias calculation module for fake image detection.

Result: R$^2$BD is 22 times faster than existing methods, achieves better detection accuracy, and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by an average of 13.87% in cross-dataset evaluations across 10 public datasets.

Conclusion: R$^2$BD sets a new benchmark in fake image detection by combining speed, accuracy, and generalization. It introduces a universal approach to detect images generated by various AI models and improves scalability for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recently, reconstruction-based methods have gained attention for AIGC image detection. These methods leverage pre-trained diffusion models to reconstruct inputs and measure residuals for distinguishing real from fake images. Their key advantage lies in reducing reliance on dataset-specific artifacts and improving generalization under distribution shifts. However, they are limited by significant inefficiency due to multi-step inversion and reconstruction, and their reliance on diffusion backbones further limits generalization to other generative paradigms such as GANs.
  In this paper, we propose a novel fake image detection framework, called R$^2$BD, built upon two key designs: (1) G-LDM, a unified reconstruction model that simulates the generation behaviors of VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models, thereby broadening the detection scope beyond prior diffusion-only approaches; and (2) a residual bias calculation module that distinguishes real and fake images in a single inference step, which is a significant efficiency improvement over existing methods that typically require 20$+$ steps.
  Extensive experiments on the benchmark from 10 public datasets demonstrate that R$^2$BD is over 22$\times$ faster than existing reconstruction-based methods while achieving superior detection accuracy. In cross-dataset evaluations, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 13.87\%, showing strong efficiency and generalization across diverse generative methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Cross-Modal Residual Fusion Network (CRFN) to improve audio-visual embodied navigation by refining cross-modal interactions and improving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is to enhance the effectiveness of audio-visual embodied navigation by addressing challenges such as single-modality dominance and information degradation during multimodal fusion.

Method: The CRFN introduces bidirectional residual interactions between audio and visual streams, stabilizing cross-modal fusion while maintaining independence of individual modality representations.

Result: CRFN outperforms existing methods on Replica and Matterport3D datasets, achieving better generalization across datasets and uncovering differentiated modality dependence in embodied agents.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the effectiveness of CRFN in improving audio-visual navigation and offers new insights into cross-modal collaboration mechanisms in embodied agents.

Abstract: Audio-visual embodied navigation aims to enable an agent to autonomously localize and reach a sound source in unseen 3D environments by leveraging auditory cues. The key challenge of this task lies in effectively modeling the interaction between heterogeneous features during multimodal fusion, so as to avoid single-modality dominance or information degradation, particularly in cross-domain scenarios. To address this, we propose a Cross-Modal Residual Fusion Network, which introduces bidirectional residual interactions between audio and visual streams to achieve complementary modeling and fine-grained alignment, while maintaining the independence of their representations. Unlike conventional methods that rely on simple concatenation or attention gating, CRFN explicitly models cross-modal interactions via residual connections and incorporates stabilization techniques to improve convergence and robustness. Experiments on the Replica and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that CRFN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fusion baselines and achieves stronger cross-domain generalization. Notably, our experiments also reveal that agents exhibit differentiated modality dependence across different datasets. The discovery of this phenomenon provides a new perspective for understanding the cross-modal collaboration mechanism of embodied agents.

TL;DR: ForensicFormer is a hierarchical framework for cross-domain forgery detection that significantly improves accuracy and robustness over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing prevalence of AI-generated and edited imagery has made traditional forensic techniques ineffective, necessitating innovative solutions for accurate forgery detection.

Method: The proposed method unifies low-level, mid-level, and high-level analysis using cross-attention transformers to detect forgery across various manipulation techniques.

Result: ForensicFormer achieves 86.8% accuracy across diverse test sets, surpassing state-of-the-art detectors, and demonstrates robustness to JPEG compression while offering detailed forgery localization.

Conclusion: The ForensicFormer framework integrates image forensics and deep learning to provide a reliable and interpretable solution for real-world forgery detection scenarios.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated imagery and sophisticated editing tools has rendered traditional forensic methods ineffective for cross-domain forgery detection. We present ForensicFormer, a hierarchical multi-scale framework that unifies low-level artifact detection, mid-level boundary analysis, and high-level semantic reasoning via cross-attention transformers. Unlike prior single-paradigm approaches, which achieve <75% accuracy on out-of-distribution datasets, our method maintains 86.8% average accuracy across seven diverse test sets, spanning traditional manipulations, GAN-generated images, and diffusion model outputs - a significant improvement over state-of-the-art universal detectors. We demonstrate superior robustness to JPEG compression (83% accuracy at Q=70 vs. 66% for baselines) and provide pixel-level forgery localization with a 0.76 F1-score. Extensive ablation studies validate that each hierarchical component contributes 4-10% accuracy improvement, and qualitative analysis reveals interpretable forensic features aligned with human expert reasoning. Our work bridges classical image forensics and modern deep learning, offering a practical solution for real-world deployment where manipulation techniques are unknown a priori.

*Jiahao Qin,Yiwen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAR-Net, a framework for image registration under domain shift through scene-appearance disentanglement. Achieves superior results compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in image registration caused by systematic intensity differences between source and target images, where existing methods fail due to brightness constancy violation.

Method: Using a novel framework called SAR-Net, the approach decomposes images into scene representations and appearance codes, facilitating registration by re-rendering instead of direct intensity matches.

Result: SAR-Net achieves high accuracy metrics (0.885 SSIM and 0.979 NCC), significantly outperforming baselines by 3.1x, while ensuring real-time performance at 77 fps.

Conclusion: SAR-Net effectively addresses domain shift challenges in image registration through a principled disentanglement approach, validated theoretically and empirically. Code and data are shared for reproducibility.

Abstract: Image registration under domain shift remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and medical imaging: when source and target images exhibit systematic intensity differences, the brightness constancy assumption underlying conventional registration methods is violated, rendering correspondence estimation ill-posed. We propose SAR-Net, a unified framework that addresses this challenge through principled scene-appearance disentanglement. Our key insight is that observed images can be decomposed into domain-invariant scene representations and domain-specific appearance codes, enabling registration via re-rendering rather than direct intensity matching. We establish theoretical conditions under which this decomposition enables consistent cross-domain alignment (Proposition 1) and prove that our scene consistency loss provides a sufficient condition for geometric correspondence in the shared latent space (Proposition 2). Empirically, we validate SAR-Net on bidirectional scanning microscopy, where coupled domain shift and geometric distortion create a challenging real-world testbed. Our method achieves 0.885 SSIM and 0.979 NCC, representing 3.1x improvement over the strongest baseline, while maintaining real-time performance (77 fps). Ablation studies confirm that both scene consistency and domain alignment losses are necessary: removing either degrades performance by 90% SSIM or causes 223x increase in latent alignment error, respectively. Code and data are available at https://github.com/D-ST-Sword/SAR-NET.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the 'Semantic Lifecycle,' a unified framework to analyze and improve semantic knowledge processing in embodied AI using foundation models (FMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied agents face challenges in processing multi-source and multi-stage semantic information, especially in increasingly complex environments and tasks. There is a need for more robust and generalizable semantic processing methods for such scenarios.

Method: The authors propose the Semantic Lifecycle framework, analyzing semantic knowledge across three interconnected stages: acquisition, representation, and storage, while leveraging the cross-domain capabilities of foundation models.

Result: The paper provides a unified perspective on semantic processing in embodied AI, offering comparisons of recent advancements and addressing the evolution of semantic knowledge through foundation models.

Conclusion: The Semantic Lifecycle demonstrates how foundation models enhance semantic processing in embodied AI, highlighting current challenges and proposing future research directions.

Abstract: Semantic information in embodied AI is inherently multi-source and multi-stage, making it challenging to fully leverage for achieving stable perception-to-action loops in real-world environments. Early studies have combined manual engineering with deep neural networks, achieving notable progress in specific semantic-related embodied tasks. However, as embodied agents encounter increasingly complex environments and open-ended tasks, the demand for more generalizable and robust semantic processing capabilities has become imperative. Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) address this challenge through their cross-domain generalization abilities and rich semantic priors, reshaping the landscape of embodied AI research. In this survey, we propose the Semantic Lifecycle as a unified framework to characterize the evolution of semantic knowledge within embodied AI driven by foundation models. Departing from traditional paradigms that treat semantic processing as isolated modules or disjoint tasks, our framework offers a holistic perspective that captures the continuous flow and maintenance of semantic knowledge. Guided by this embodied semantic lifecycle, we further analyze and compare recent advances across three key stages: acquisition, representation, and storage. Finally, we summarize existing challenges and outline promising directions for future research.

TL;DR: The paper addresses task interference in image generation/editing models by introducing a method to incorporate semantic task intent into routing decisions in a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified image generation and editing models face task interference due to conflicting objectives and lack of task awareness in routing decisions.

Method: The authors propose a method to inject semantic intent into MoE routing using a Hierarchical Task Semantic Annotation scheme and Predictive Alignment Regularization, enabling task-aware routing.

Result: The method effectively mitigates task interference, enhancing fidelity and quality while allowing experts to develop semantically correlated specializations.

Conclusion: Incorporating semantic awareness into routing decisions can address task interference, leading to improved performance and meaningful expert specialization.

Abstract: Unified image generation and editing models suffer from severe task interference in dense diffusion transformers architectures, where a shared parameter space must compromise between conflicting objectives (e.g., local editing v.s. subject-driven generation). While the sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm is a promising solution, its gating networks remain task-agnostic, operating based on local features, unaware of global task intent. This task-agnostic nature prevents meaningful specialization and fails to resolve the underlying task interference. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to inject semantic intent into MoE routing. We introduce a Hierarchical Task Semantic Annotation scheme to create structured task descriptors (e.g., scope, type, preservation). We then design Predictive Alignment Regularization to align internal routing decisions with the task's high-level semantics. This regularization evolves the gating network from a task-agnostic executor to a dispatch center. Our model effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming dense baselines in fidelity and quality, and our analysis shows that experts naturally develop clear and semantically correlated specializations.

*Thomas Snyder,H. Lexie Yang,Stefan Schnake,Steffen Schotthöfer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to compress geospatial foundation models using DLRT during transfer learning, enabling lightweight and accurate deployment on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to deploy effective geospatial foundation models on resource-limited edge devices, but their large parameter size and accuracy degradation from compression hinder their practical use.

Method: The authors use a manifold-constrained optimization framework (DLRT) to compress vision transformer-based geospatial models by employing structured low-dimensional parameterizations that align with downstream tasks.

Result: The proposed method achieves strong compression while maintaining task-specific performance, surpassing existing techniques like LoRA on geospatial benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach enables the creation of lightweight, high-performing geospatial models for deployment on edge devices by balancing compression with accuracy preservation.

Abstract: Deploying geospatial foundation models on resource-constrained edge devices demands compact architectures that maintain high downstream performance. However, their large parameter counts and the accuracy loss often induced by compression limit practical adoption. In this work, we leverage manifold-constrained optimization framework DLRT to compress large vision transformer-based geospatial foundation models during transfer learning. By enforcing structured low-dimensional parameterizations aligned with downstream objectives, this approach achieves strong compression while preserving task-specific accuracy. We show that the method outperforms of-the-shelf low-rank methods as LoRA. Experiments on diverse geospatial benchmarks confirm substantial parameter reduction with minimal accuracy loss, enabling high-performing, on-device geospatial models.

### [107] [Adaptive few-shot learning for robust part quality classification in two-photon lithography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08885)
*Sixian Jia,Ruo-Syuan Mei,Chenhui Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive computer vision framework to overcome challenges in dynamic environments of two-photon lithography quality control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve automated quality control in two-photon lithography where existing static models fail to detect unseen defects, update efficiently from limited data, and adapt to different part geometries.

Method: The framework integrates three techniques: a statistical hypothesis testing with LDA for novelty detection, a two-stage strategy for incremental learning, and a few-shot domain adaptation using DANN.

Result: The proposed methods achieved 99-100% accuracy in new defect detection, 92% incremental learning accuracy with 20 samples, and 96.19% domain adaptation accuracy with 5 samples.

Conclusion: The framework is robust and efficient for quality control in evolving manufacturing environments, addressing key limitations of prior static models.

Abstract: Two-photon lithography (TPL) is an advanced additive manufacturing (AM) technique for fabricating high-precision micro-structures. While computer vision (CV) is proofed for automated quality control, existing models are often static, rendering them ineffective in dynamic manufacturing environments. These models typically cannot detect new, unseen defect classes, be efficiently updated from scarce data, or adapt to new part geometries. To address this gap, this paper presents an adaptive CV framework for the entire life-cycle of quality model maintenance. The proposed framework is built upon a same, scale-robust backbone model and integrates three key methodologies: (1) a statistical hypothesis testing framework based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for novelty detection, (2) a two-stage, rehearsal-based strategy for few-shot incremental learning, and (3) a few-shot Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) for few-shot domain adaptation. The framework was evaluated on a TPL dataset featuring hemisphere as source domain and cube as target domain structures, with each domain categorized into good, minor damaged, and damaged quality classes. The hypothesis testing method successfully identified new class batches with 99-100% accuracy. The incremental learning method integrated a new class to 92% accuracy using only K=20 samples. The domain adaptation model bridged the severe domain gap, achieving 96.19% accuracy on the target domain using only K=5 shots. These results demonstrate a robust and data-efficient solution for deploying and maintaining CV models in evolving production scenarios.

*Satyaki Roy Chowdhury,Golrokh Mirzaei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UAMSA-UNet, an advanced approach for brain tumor segmentation using uncertainty-aware multi-scale attention and Bayesian mechanisms to improve prediction smoothness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of noisy boundaries in brain tumor segmentation produced by traditional CNN and U-Net methods, particularly in regions of tumor infiltration.

Method: UAMSA-UNet combines Monte Carlo Dropout for data-driven smoothing, multi-scale features, and attention maps for capturing detailed and global context. It employs a smoothing-regularized loss function to enhance spatial coherence.

Result: On datasets like BraTS2023 and BraTS2024, UAMSA-UNet outperforms traditional approaches in metrics like Dice Similarity Coefficient and mean IoU, achieving gains of up to 4.5%. It also significantly reduces computational overhead compared to U-Net++.

Conclusion: By integrating multi-scale attention and uncertainty-aware features, UAMSA-UNet improves segmentation quality, reduces computational complexity, and provides a flexible basis for future developments, including transformer-based modules.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet many CNN and U-Net based approaches produce noisy boundaries in regions of tumor infiltration. We introduce UAMSA-UNet, an Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Scale Attention-based Bayesian U-Net that in- stead leverages Monte Carlo Dropout to learn a data-driven smoothing prior over its predictions, while fusing multi-scale features and attention maps to capture both fine details and global context. Our smoothing-regularized loss augments binary cross-entropy with a variance penalty across stochas- tic forward passes, discouraging spurious fluctuations and yielding spatially coherent masks. On BraTS2023, UAMSA- UNet improves Dice Similarity Coefficient by up to 3.3% and mean IoU by up to 2.7% over U-Net; on BraTS2024, it delivers up to 4.5% Dice and 4.0% IoU gains over the best baseline. Remarkably, it also reduces FLOPs by 42.5% rel- ative to U-Net++ while maintaining higher accuracy. These results demonstrate that, by combining multi-scale attention with a learned smoothing prior, UAMSA-UNet achieves both better segmentation quality and computational efficiency, and provides a flexible foundation for future integration with transformer-based modules for further enhanced segmenta- tion results.

Result: The system successfully detects detailed thermal anomalies and defects more accurately than traditional methods based on experimental validations.

Conclusion: Thermo-LIO significantly enhances diagnostic precision, enables real-time processing, and extends inspection coverage, advancing structural health monitoring methodologies.

Abstract: Traditional two-dimensional thermography, despite being non-invasive and useful for defect detection in the construction field, is limited in effectively assessing complex geometries, inaccessible areas, and subsurface defects. This paper introduces Thermo-LIO, a novel multi-sensor system that can enhance Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) by fusing thermal imaging with high-resolution LiDAR. To achieve this, the study first develops a multimodal fusion method combining thermal imaging and LiDAR, enabling precise calibration and synchronization of multimodal data streams to create accurate representations of temperature distributions in buildings. Second, it integrates this fusion approach with LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), enabling full coverage of large-scale structures and allowing for detailed monitoring of temperature variations and defect detection across inspection cycles. Experimental validations, including case studies on a bridge and a hall building, demonstrate that Thermo-LIO can detect detailed thermal anomalies and structural defects more accurately than traditional methods. The system enhances diagnostic precision, enables real-time processing, and expands inspection coverage, highlighting the crucial role of multimodal sensor integration in advancing SHM methodologies for large-scale civil infrastructure.

TL;DR: This paper adapts SAM 2.1 for pose-guided human segmentation under occlusion and introduces a fine-tuning strategy for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM struggles with occlusions where keypoints may be invisible. The goal is to enhance segmentation robustness and accuracy in such scenarios.

Method: The method introduces minimal encoder modifications to SAM and employs a fine-tuning strategy called PoseMaskRefine. The approach integrates visible pose keypoints into SAM’s iterative processes and simplifies inference by prompting with the three most visible keypoints.

Result: Results indicate improved robustness and accuracy for segmentation under occlusion across various datasets while preserving SAM’s generalization strength.

Conclusion: Pose-guided fine-tuning of SAM enables effective segmentation in occlusion scenarios and retains its generalization. Code and models will be publicly released.

Abstract: Segment Anything (SAM) provides an unprecedented foundation for human segmentation, but may struggle under occlusion, where keypoints may be partially or fully invisible. We adapt SAM 2.1 for pose-guided segmentation with minimal encoder modifications, retaining its strong generalization. Using a fine-tuning strategy called PoseMaskRefine, we incorporate pose keypoints with high visibility into the iterative correction process originally employed by SAM, yielding improved robustness and accuracy across multiple datasets. During inference, we simplify prompting by selecting only the three keypoints with the highest visibility. This strategy reduces sensitivity to common errors, such as missing body parts or misclassified clothing, and allows accurate mask prediction from as few as a single keypoint. Our results demonstrate that pose-guided fine-tuning of SAM enables effective, occlusion-aware human segmentation while preserving the generalization capabilities of the original model. The code and pretrained models will be available at https://mirapurkrabek.github.io/BBox-MaskPose.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for localising planetary rovers using machine learning and cross-view-localising neural networks, addressing the challenge of limited real space training data by utilizing semantic segmentation, synthetic data, and real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in enabling advanced autonomy in planetary robotics to handle future missions' increased scale and scope, particularly involving ground-aerial robotic teams.

Method: The proposed method utilizes dual-encoder deep neural networks for cross-view localisation, leveraging semantic segmentation with vision foundation models and synthetic data to address data scarcity. A new dataset of real rover trajectories and synthetic image pairs is also introduced.

Result: The approach demonstrated accurate position estimation for rovers across various trajectories by integrating cross-view networks with particle filters, using ground-view RGB image sequences.

Conclusion: This method effectively bridges the domain gap and facilitates localization despite limited real-world training data, supporting the development of more autonomous planetary robotic systems.

Abstract: Accurate localisation in planetary robotics enables the advanced autonomy required to support the increased scale and scope of future missions. The successes of the Ingenuity helicopter and multiple planetary orbiters lay the groundwork for future missions that use ground-aerial robotic teams. In this paper, we consider rovers using machine learning to localise themselves in a local aerial map using limited field-of-view monocular ground-view RGB images as input. A key consideration for machine learning methods is that real space data with ground-truth position labels suitable for training is scarce. In this work, we propose a novel method of localising rovers in an aerial map using cross-view-localising dual-encoder deep neural networks. We leverage semantic segmentation with vision foundation models and high volume synthetic data to bridge the domain gap to real images. We also contribute a new cross-view dataset of real-world rover trajectories with corresponding ground-truth localisation data captured in a planetary analogue facility, plus a high volume dataset of analogous synthetic image pairs. Using particle filters for state estimation with the cross-view networks allows accurate position estimation over simple and complex trajectories based on sequences of ground-view images.

*Xiaoyu Ji,Chenhao Zhang,Tyler James Downard,Zoltan Nagy,Ali Shakouri,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper tackles the difficulty of analyzing crystal agglomeration from 2D microscopic images by developing a novel instance camera focus prediction network and combining it with an instance segmentation model to improve classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges posed by the shallow depth of field in optical microscopy, which often misrepresents crystal agglomeration due to mixed in-focus and out-of-focus layers.

Method: The authors developed a camera focus prediction network to determine focus levels and integrated it with an instance segmentation model for classifying crystal agglomeration.

Result: The proposed method achieved higher agglomeration classification and segmentation accuracy compared to baseline models on ammonium perchlorate and sugar crystal datasets.

Conclusion: The integration of focus prediction network and segmentation models significantly enhances the accuracy of agglomeration analysis in microscopic imaging, addressing limitations imposed by 2D imaging.

Abstract: Agglomeration refers to the process of crystal clustering due to interparticle forces. Crystal agglomeration analysis from microscopic images is challenging due to the inherent limitations of two-dimensional imaging. Overlapping crystals may appear connected even when located at different depth layers. Because optical microscopes have a shallow depth of field, crystals that are in-focus and out-of-focus in the same image typically reside on different depth layers and do not constitute true agglomeration. To address this, we first quantified camera focus with an instance camera focus prediction network to predict 2 class focus level that aligns better with visual observations than traditional image processing focus measures. Then an instance segmentation model is combined with the predicted focus level for agglomeration classification. Our proposed method has a higher agglomeration classification and segmentation accuracy than the baseline models on ammonium perchlorate crystal and sugar crystal dataset.

*Jeremiah Coholich,Justin Wit,Robert Azarcon,Zsolt Kira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MANGO, an image translation method to enhance vision-based robot manipulation in presence of camera viewpoint variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot manipulation tasks struggle with robustness to camera viewpoint shifts, especially due to limited diversity in real-world demonstration data. Simulation provides diverse data but poses sim2real challenges.

Method: The authors propose MANGO, which uses novel segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE loss, a highly-regularized discriminator, and a modified PatchNCE loss for generating consistent sim2real viewpoint translations.

Result: MANGO outperforms other image translation methods in maintaining viewpoint consistency and increases success rates (up to 60%) in previously challenging viewpoints during imitation-learning tasks.

Conclusion: MANGO demonstrates its ability to improve policy robustness by generating diverse viewpoints from simulation, addressing sim2real gaps effectively.

Abstract: Vision-based policies for robot manipulation have achieved significant recent success, but are still brittle to distribution shifts such as camera viewpoint variations. Robot demonstration data is scarce and often lacks appropriate variation in camera viewpoints. Simulation offers a way to collect robot demonstrations at scale with comprehensive coverage of different viewpoints, but presents a visual sim2real challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose MANGO -- an unpaired image translation method with a novel segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE loss, a highly-regularized discriminator design, and a modified PatchNCE loss. We find that these elements are crucial for maintaining viewpoint consistency during sim2real translation. When training MANGO, we only require a small amount of fixed-camera data from the real world, but show that our method can generate diverse unseen viewpoints by translating simulated observations. In this domain, MANGO outperforms all other image translation methods we tested. Imitation-learning policies trained on data augmented by MANGO are able to achieve success rates as high as 60\% on views that the non-augmented policy fails completely on.

*Amar Kavuri,Howard C. Gifford,Mini Das*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study investigates the impact of image and signal properties on visual attention during signal detection, using simulated breast tomographic images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why misdiagnosis occurs in medical imaging due to interactions between visual attention and signal/background properties.

Method: The study used DBT images with varying breast densities and inserted lesions to collect visual attention data from human observers during a signal detection task.

Result: Observer performance depended on signal morphology and background complexity, with visual attention engagement influenced by spatial frequency dependencies.

Conclusion: Decision failures are the main cause of errors in detection tasks, and signal detectability is shaped by interactions between signal features and background noise.

Abstract: We aim to investigate the impact of image and signal properties on visual attention mechanisms during a signal detection task in digital images. The application of insight yielded from this work spans many areas of digital imaging where signal or pattern recognition is involved in complex heterogenous background. We used simulated tomographic breast images as the platform to investigate this question. While radiologists are highly effective at analyzing medical images to detect and diagnose diseases, misdiagnosis still occurs. We selected digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images as a sample medical images with different breast densities and structures using digital breast phantoms (Bakic and XCAT). Two types of lesions (with distinct spatial frequency properties) were randomly inserted in the phantoms during projections to generate abnormal cases. Six human observers participated in observer study designed for a locating and detection of an 3-mm sphere lesion and 6-mm spicule lesion in reconstructed in-plane DBT slices. We collected eye-gaze data to estimate gaze metrics and to examine differences in visual attention mechanisms. We found that detection performance in complex visual environments is strongly constrained by later perceptual stages, with decision failures accounting for the largest proportion of errors. Signal detectability is jointly influenced by both target morphology and background complexity, revealing a critical interaction between local signal features and global anatomical noise. Increased fixation duration on spiculated lesions suggests that visual attention is differentially engaged depending on background and signal spatial frequency dependencies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fast-ThinkAct is a reasoning framework for Vision-Language-Action tasks, achieving strong performance with reduced inference latency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and high latency of explicit chain-of-thought reasoning in complex tasks requiring visual and linguistic understanding.

Method: The framework distills latent reasoning from a teacher model using a preference-guided objective to align linguistic and visual planning for embodied control.

Result: Fast-ThinkAct shows strong performance across diverse benchmarks with up to 89.3% reduced inference latency while maintaining effective planning and adaptation capabilities.

Conclusion: The approach balances compact reasoning and effective action execution, advancing the performance and efficiency in Vision-Language-Action tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) tasks require reasoning over complex visual scenes and executing adaptive actions in dynamic environments. While recent studies on reasoning VLAs show that explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) can improve generalization, they suffer from high inference latency due to lengthy reasoning traces. We propose Fast-ThinkAct, an efficient reasoning framework that achieves compact yet performant planning through verbalizable latent reasoning. Fast-ThinkAct learns to reason efficiently with latent CoTs by distilling from a teacher, driven by a preference-guided objective to align manipulation trajectories that transfers both linguistic and visual planning capabilities for embodied control. This enables reasoning-enhanced policy learning that effectively connects compact reasoning to action execution. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied manipulation and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-ThinkAct achieves strong performance with up to 89.3\% reduced inference latency over state-of-the-art reasoning VLAs, while maintaining effective long-horizon planning, few-shot adaptation, and failure recovery.

### [116] [Depth-Wise Representation Development Under Blockwise Self-Supervised Learning for Video Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09040)
*Jonas Römer,Timo Dickscheid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores training masked video transformers without end-to-end backpropagation using blockwise self-supervised learning (BWSSL). Local masked reconstruction losses are applied to encoder blocks, yielding comparable representations to end-to-end training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by recent advances in BWSSL, the paper investigates the feasibility of training masked video transformers without end-to-end backpropagation, addressing spatiotemporal and long-range temporal challenges.

Method: Partition the encoder into multiple blocks and apply local masked reconstruction losses to each block during training to replace end-to-end backpropagation.

Result: Training successfully converges and produces representations close to matched end-to-end baselines under key proxies such as linear-probe and retrieval metrics, with insights into depth-wise learning dynamics.

Conclusion: Blockwise learning introduces earlier higher-level representation structures, influencing token-level dynamics and revealing gaps from late block saturation and geometry-preserving regimes compared to end-to-end methods.

Abstract: End-to-end backpropagation couples all layers through a global error signal, enabling coordinated learning but requiring long-range credit assignment. Motivated by recent progress in blockwise self-supervised learning (BWSSL), we ask whether masked video transformers can be trained without end-to-end backpropagation. Applying BWSSL to masked video modeling remains relatively underexplored and must handle spatiotemporal context and long-range temporal structure. More broadly, analyses that compare BWSSL and end-to-end training in terms of learning dynamics and depth-wise representation development remain sparse. We apply blockwise learning to a masked autoencoding video vision transformer by partitioning the encoder into blocks, each of which is optimized with a local masked reconstruction loss. Across model sizes and partition granularities, training converges and yields representations close to matched end-to-end baselines under linear-probe and retrieval proxies. In order to compare intermediate representations, we analyze depth-wise decodability, inter-block similarity, and patch-level diagnostics. Blockwise training exposes higher-level structure earlier, while later blocks saturate and operate in a more geometry-preserving regime. It can also induce token-level shifts consistent with stronger early mixing that pooled metrics can miss. These findings point to late-block saturation and interface formation as contributors to the remaining gap.

### [117] [Exploring Reliable Spatiotemporal Dependencies for Efficient Visual Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09078)
*Junze Shi,Yang Yu,Jian Shi,Haibo Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces STDTrack, a framework that incorporates spatiotemporal dependencies into lightweight object trackers, improving performance while maintaining real-time efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based lightweight object trackers fail to fully utilize spatiotemporal information in videos, leading to performance limitations compared to non-lightweight trackers.

Method: The proposed STDTrack leverages dense video sampling, a Multi-frame Information Fusion Module (MFIFM), a Spatiotemporal Token Maintainer (STM), and a multi-scale prediction head to enhance spatiotemporal utilization while ensuring real-time efficiency.

Result: STDTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance across six benchmarks, including rivaling high-performance non-real-time trackers like MixFormer on GOT-10k, operating at 192 FPS on GPU and 41 FPS on CPU.

Conclusion: Integrating reliable spatiotemporal dependencies allows lightweight trackers like STDTrack to bridge the performance gap with high-performance trackers while retaining real-time operation.

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based lightweight object tracking have established new standards across benchmarks, leveraging the global receptive field and powerful feature extraction capabilities of attention mechanisms. Despite these achievements, existing methods universally employ sparse sampling during training--utilizing only one template and one search image per sequence--which fails to comprehensively explore spatiotemporal information in videos. This limitation constrains performance and cause the gap between lightweight and high-performance trackers. To bridge this divide while maintaining real-time efficiency, we propose STDTrack, a framework that pioneers the integration of reliable spatiotemporal dependencies into lightweight trackers. Our approach implements dense video sampling to maximize spatiotemporal information utilization. We introduce a temporally propagating spatiotemporal token to guide per-frame feature extraction. To ensure comprehensive target state representation, we disign the Multi-frame Information Fusion Module (MFIFM), which augments current dependencies using historical context. The MFIFM operates on features stored in our constructed Spatiotemporal Token Maintainer (STM), where a quality-based update mechanism ensures information reliability. Considering the scale variation among tracking targets, we develop a multi-scale prediction head to dynamically adapt to objects of different sizes. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks. Notably, on GOT-10k, STDTrack rivals certain high-performance non-real-time trackers (e.g., MixFormer) while operating at 192 FPS(GPU) and 41 FPS(CPU).

*Yanguang Sun,Chao Wang,Jian Yang,Lei Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel fine-tuning paradigm, WEFT, for efficient segmentation of objects in optical remote sensing images by leveraging wavelet experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address the limitations of large-scale foundation models in optical remote sensing image segmentation caused by heavy computational requirements during full-parameter fine-tuning.

Method: The proposed WEFT approach uses a wavelet expert extractor for task-specific feature generation and an expert-guided conditional adapter to refine features for efficient fine-tuning.

Result: WEFT demonstrates superior performance compared to 21 state-of-the-art methods across multiple ORSIs datasets and achieves strong results in camouflage, natural, and medical tasks.

Conclusion: WEFT allows efficient adaptation of large-scale models with fewer trainable parameters, enhancing segmentation performance while reducing computational complexity.

Abstract: Accurately localizing and segmenting relevant objects from optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) is critical for advancing remote sensing applications. Existing methods are typically built upon moderate-scale pre-trained models and employ diverse optimization strategies to achieve promising performance under full-parameter fine-tuning. In fact, deeper and larger-scale foundation models can provide stronger support for performance improvement. However, due to their massive number of parameters, directly adopting full-parameter fine-tuning leads to pronounced training difficulties, such as excessive GPU memory consumption and high computational costs, which result in extremely limited exploration of large-scale models in existing works. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic wavelet expert-guided fine-tuning paradigm with fewer trainable parameters, dubbed WEFT, which efficiently adapts large-scale foundation models to ORSIs segmentation tasks by leveraging the guidance of wavelet experts. Specifically, we introduce a task-specific wavelet expert extractor to model wavelet experts from different perspectives and dynamically regulate their outputs, thereby generating trainable features enriched with task-specific information for subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we construct an expert-guided conditional adapter that first enhances the fine-grained perception of frozen features for specific tasks by injecting trainable features, and then iteratively updates the information of both types of feature, allowing for efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that our WEFT not only outperforms 21 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three ORSIs datasets, but also achieves optimal results in camouflage, natural, and medical scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper presents SAM-Aug, a framework leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for improving few-shot semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, achieving notable accuracy gains under limited labeled data conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the poor performance of semantic segmentation models under limited labeled data conditions, particularly for remote sensing land cover monitoring.

Method: Proposed SAM-Aug, which uses SAM-derived geometry-aware mask priors and a novel loss function called RegionSmoothLoss to enforce consistency across regions and time frames, enhancing model training.

Result: SAM-Aug outperformed the baseline by 2.33 percentage points in mean test mIoU on the PASTIS-R dataset, showing a relative improvement of 6.89 percent under limited label settings.

Conclusion: SAM-Aug demonstrates that foundation models like SAM can boost semantic segmentation performance under labeling scarcity, providing a scalable, annotation-efficient solution for remote sensing analysis.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation of time-series remote sensing images remains a critical challenge, particularly in regions where labeled data is scarce or costly to obtain. While state-of-the-art models perform well under full supervision, their performance degrades significantly under limited labeling, limiting their real-world applicability. In this work, we propose SAM-Aug, a new annotation-efficient framework that leverages the geometry-aware segmentation capability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to improve few-shot land cover mapping. Our approach constructs cloud-free composite images from temporal sequences and applies SAM in a fully unsupervised manner to generate geometry-aware mask priors. These priors are then integrated into training through a proposed loss function called RegionSmoothLoss, which enforces prediction consistency within each SAM-derived region across temporal frames, effectively regularizing the model to respect semantically coherent structures. Extensive experiments on the PASTIS-R benchmark under a 5 percent labeled setting demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SAM-Aug. Averaged over three random seeds (42, 2025, 4090), our method achieves a mean test mIoU of 36.21 percent, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline by +2.33 percentage points, a relative improvement of 6.89 percent. Notably, on the most favorable split (seed=42), SAM-Aug reaches a test mIoU of 40.28 percent, representing an 11.2 percent relative gain with no additional labeled data. The consistent improvement across all seeds confirms the generalization power of leveraging foundation model priors under annotation scarcity. Our results highlight that vision models like SAM can serve as useful regularizers in few-shot remote sensing learning, offering a scalable and plug-and-play solution for land cover monitoring without requiring manual annotations or model fine-tuning.

*Yang Li,Aming Wu,Zihao Zhang,Yahong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) struggles with unseen environments; the proposed slow4fast-VLN uses fast-slow reasoning for dynamic adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance VLN models to handle unseen environments and inconsistent instructions, breaking the limitations of close-set assumptions.

Method: The proposed slow4fast-VLN employs a dynamic interactive fast-slow reasoning framework, combining real-time decision making with slow reflection on accumulated memories.

Result: The framework allows agents to adapt to new scenarios effectively by refining fast-reasoning strategies with learned experiences from slow reasoning.

Conclusion: The integration of interactive fast-slow reasoning demonstrates improved adaptability in VLN tasks for open-world environments.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation aims to enable agents to navigate to a target location based on language instructions. Traditional VLN often follows a close-set assumption, i.e., training and test data share the same style of the input images and instructions. However, the real world is open and filled with various unseen environments, posing enormous difficulties for close-set methods. To this end, we focus on the General Scene Adaptation (GSA-VLN) task, aiming to learn generalized navigation ability by introducing diverse environments and inconsistent intructions.Towards this task, when facing unseen environments and instructions, the challenge mainly lies in how to enable the agent to dynamically produce generalized strategies during the navigation process. Recent research indicates that by means of fast and slow cognition systems, human beings could generate stable policies, which strengthen their adaptation for open world. Inspired by this idea, we propose the slow4fast-VLN, establishing a dynamic interactive fast-slow reasoning framework. The fast-reasoning module, an end-to-end strategy network, outputs actions via real-time input. It accumulates execution records in a history repository to build memory. The slow-reasoning module analyze the memories generated by the fast-reasoning module. Through deep reflection, it extracts experiences that enhance the generalization ability of decision-making. These experiences are structurally stored and used to continuously optimize the fast-reasoning module. Unlike traditional methods that treat fast-slow reasoning as independent mechanisms, our framework enables fast-slow interaction. By leveraging the experiences from slow reasoning. This interaction allows the system to continuously adapt and efficiently execute navigation tasks when facing unseen scenarios.

### [121] [LP-LLM: End-to-End Real-World Degraded License Plate Text Recognition via Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09116)
*Haoyan Gong,Hongbin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an end-to-end, structure-aware multimodal reasoning framework for license plate recognition (LPR) under severe degradation conditions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to real-world LPR face challenges due to degradations like motion blur and misaligned objectives in the restoration-then-recognition paradigms, while existing vision-language models lack structural modeling for license plate sequences.

Method: The proposed approach employs a Character-Aware Multimodal Reasoning Module (CMRM) with learnable character slot queries and cross-attention mechanisms, integrating structural priors into visual-language models, and fine-tuning using LoRA for generalization and domain adaptation.

Result: The method exhibits superior performance on both synthetic and real-world degraded datasets compared to existing restoration-recognition techniques, validating its efficacy for low-quality text recognition tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating structured reasoning into large vision-language models enhances low-quality text recognition, addressing limitations in current LPR methods.

Abstract: Real-world License Plate Recognition (LPR) faces significant challenges from severe degradations such as motion blur, low resolution, and complex illumination. The prevailing "restoration-then-recognition" two-stage paradigm suffers from a fundamental flaw: the pixel-level optimization objectives of image restoration models are misaligned with the semantic goals of character recognition, leading to artifact interference and error accumulation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated powerful general capabilities, they lack explicit structural modeling for license plate character sequences (e.g., fixed length, specific order). To address this, we propose an end-to-end structure-aware multimodal reasoning framework based on Qwen3-VL. The core innovation lies in the Character-Aware Multimodal Reasoning Module (CMRM), which introduces a set of learnable Character Slot Queries. Through a cross-attention mechanism, these queries actively retrieve fine-grained evidence corresponding to character positions from visual features. Subsequently, we inject these character-aware representations back into the visual tokens via residual modulation, enabling the language model to perform autoregressive generation based on explicit structural priors. Furthermore, combined with the LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, the model achieves domain adaptation while retaining the generalization capabilities of the large model. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world severely degraded datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing restoration-recognition combinations and general VLMs, validating the superiority of incorporating structured reasoning into large models for low-quality text recognition tasks.

*Jackie Alex,Guoqiang Huan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LPCANet for improving rail defect detection by addressing computational complexity and accuracy issues, achieving state-of-the-art results on RGB-D rail datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-based rail defect detection methods struggle with high computational demands, parameter inefficiency, and unsatisfactory accuracy.

Method: The proposed LPCANet employs RGB-D data, combining MobileNetv2 for RGB analysis, a lightweight pyramid module for depth, cross-attention for fusion, and a spatial feature extractor for detailed structure analysis.

Result: LPCANet achieves superior performance with 9.90 million parameters, 2.50 G FLOPs, and 162.60 fps, outperforming 18 methods in metrics like $S_α$, IOU, and MAE. It generalizes well to non-rail datasets.

Conclusion: LPCANet bridges traditional and deep learning methods for practical industrial defect inspection, with plans for further model optimization for real-time use.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of current vision-based rail defect detection methods, including high computational complexity, excessive parameter counts, and suboptimal accuracy. We propose a Lightweight Pyramid Cross-Attention Network (LPCANet) that leverages RGB-D data for efficient and accurate defect identification. The architecture integrates MobileNetv2 as a backbone for RGB feature extraction with a lightweight pyramid module (LPM) for depth processing, coupled with a cross-attention mechanism (CAM) for multimodal fusion and a spatial feature extractor (SFE) for enhanced structural analysis. Comprehensive evaluations on three unsupervised RGB-D rail datasets (NEU-RSDDS-AUG, RSDD-TYPE1, RSDD-TYPE2) demonstrate that LPCANet achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 9.90 million parameters, 2.50 G FLOPs, and 162.60 fps inference speed. Compared to 18 existing methods, LPCANet shows significant improvements, including +1.48\% in $S_α$, +0.86\% in IOU, and +1.77\% in MAE over the best-performing baseline. Ablation studies confirm the critical roles of CAM and SFE, while experiments on non-rail datasets (DAGM2007, MT, Kolektor-SDD2) validate its generalization capability. The proposed framework effectively bridges traditional and deep learning approaches, offering substantial practical value for industrial defect inspection. Future work will focus on further model compression for real-time deployment.

*Xin Yuan,Meiqi Wan,Wei Liu,Xin Xu,Zheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CenterPolar introduced for Single-domain Generalized Deep Metric Learning (SDG-DML), addressing category and domain shifts with significant performance improvements over competitors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDG-DML methods struggle with adapting to unseen categories and domains due to limitations in current proxy-based expansion approaches, motivating the development of improved generalization solutions.

Method: Introduced CenterPolar, which involves two phases: (1) Centrifugal Expansion to expand source domain distributions, and (2) Centripetal Constraint to ensure class separation and consolidate domain-invariant features.

Result: CenterPolar outperformed existing methods across datasets like CUB-200-2011 Ext., Cars196 Ext., DomainNet, PACS, and Office-Home.

Conclusion: CenterPolar demonstrates effectiveness in addressing the challenges in SDG-DML by learning a more generalized metric representation through novel domain expansion and constraining mechanisms.

Abstract: Single-domain generalized deep metric learning (SDG-DML) faces the dual challenge of both category and domain shifts during testing, limiting real-world applications. Therefore, aiming to learn better generalization ability on both unseen categories and domains is a realistic goal for the SDG-DML task. To deliver the aspiration, existing SDG-DML methods employ the domain expansion-equalization strategy to expand the source data and generate out-of-distribution samples. However, these methods rely on proxy-based expansion, which tends to generate samples clustered near class proxies, failing to simulate the broad and distant domain shifts encountered in practice. To alleviate the problem, we propose CenterPolar, a novel SDG-DML framework that dynamically expands and constrains domain distributions to learn a generalizable DML model for wider target domain distributions. Specifically, \textbf{CenterPolar} contains two collaborative class-centric polarization phases: (1) Class-Centric Centrifugal Expansion ($C^3E$) and (2) Class-Centric Centripetal Constraint ($C^4$). In the first phase, $C^3E$ drives the source domain distribution by shifting the source data away from class centroids using centrifugal expansion to generalize to more unseen domains. In the second phase, to consolidate domain-invariant class information for the generalization ability to unseen categories, $C^4$ pulls all seen and unseen samples toward their class centroids while enforcing inter-class separation via centripetal constraint. Extensive experimental results on widely used CUB-200-2011 Ext., Cars196 Ext., DomainNet, PACS, and Office-Home datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our CenterPolar over existing state-of-the-art methods. The code will be released after acceptance.

*Lijun Liu,Linwei Chen,Zhishou Zhang,Meng Tian,Hengfu Cui,Ruiyang Li,Zhaocheng Liu,Qiang Ju,Qianxi Li,Hong-Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SkinFlow, a dermatology-focused framework proving that optimization of visual information transmission is superior to scaling model parameters for medical precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of large vision-language models that struggle with dermatological diagnosis due to diffuse attention and ineffective handling of subtle pathological features.

Method: SkinFlow utilizes a Virtual-Width Dynamic Vision Encoder and a two-stage reinforcement learning strategy to optimize visual information in a semantic space, focusing on diagnostic reasoning.

Result: The SkinFlow model outperformed massive general-purpose models, achieving superior diagnostic accuracy (+12.06% in Top-1 and +28.57% in Top-6) on the Fitzpatrick17k benchmark.

Conclusion: Optimizing geometric capacity and information flow proves to be more effective in enhancing diagnostic reasoning than simply expanding model parameter scales.

Abstract: General-purpose Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), despite their massive scale, often falter in dermatology due to "diffuse attention" - the inability to disentangle subtle pathological lesions from background noise. In this paper, we challenge the assumption that parameter scaling is the only path to medical precision. We introduce SkinFlow, a framework that treats diagnosis as an optimization of visual information transmission efficiency. Our approach utilizes a Virtual-Width Dynamic Vision Encoder (DVE) to "unfold" complex pathological manifolds without physical parameter expansion, coupled with a two-stage Reinforcement Learning strategy. This strategy sequentially aligns explicit medical descriptions (Stage I) and reconstructs implicit diagnostic textures (Stage II) within a constrained semantic space. Furthermore, we propose a clinically grounded evaluation protocol that prioritizes diagnostic safety and hierarchical relevance over rigid label matching. Empirical results are compelling: our 7B model establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Fitzpatrick17k benchmark, achieving a +12.06% gain in Top-1 accuracy and a +28.57% boost in Top-6 accuracy over the massive general-purpose models (e.g., Qwen3VL-235B and GPT-5.2). These findings demonstrate that optimizing geometric capacity and information flow yields superior diagnostic reasoning compared to raw parameter scaling.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SSVP, which enhances zero-shot anomaly detection by integrating diverse visual encodings with linguistic queries, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ZSAD methods struggle with single visual backbones, limiting their ability to balance global semantics and fine-grained details.

Method: The paper proposes Synergistic Semantic-Visual Prompting (SSVP), which integrates multi-scale structural priors with the semantic space of CLIP and uses advanced mechanisms like HSVS, VCPG, and VTAM for anomaly detection.

Result: SSVP achieved state-of-the-art performance with 93.0% Image-AUROC and 92.2% Pixel-AUROC on MVTec-AD, outperforming previous zero-shot approaches.

Conclusion: SSVP effectively improves fine-grained perception and robustness in ZSAD, proving its superiority in industrial inspection benchmarks.

Abstract: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable supervision-free industrial inspection. However, existing ZSAD paradigms are constrained by single visual backbones, which struggle to balance global semantic generalization with fine-grained structural discriminability. To bridge this gap, we propose Synergistic Semantic-Visual Prompting (SSVP), that efficiently fuses diverse visual encodings to elevate model's fine-grained perception. Specifically, SSVP introduces the Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Synergy (HSVS) mechanism, which deeply integrates DINOv3's multi-scale structural priors into the CLIP semantic space. Subsequently, the Vision-Conditioned Prompt Generator (VCPG) employs cross-modal attention to guide dynamic prompt generation, enabling linguistic queries to precisely anchor to specific anomaly patterns. Furthermore, to address the discrepancy between global scoring and local evidence, the Visual-Text Anomaly Mapper (VTAM) establishes a dual-gated calibration paradigm. Extensive evaluations on seven industrial benchmarks validate the robustness of our method; SSVP achieves state-of-the-art performance with 93.0\% Image-AUROC and 92.2\% Pixel-AUROC on MVTec-AD, significantly outperforming existing zero-shot approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using learned nuisance variation models to enhance model robustness against natural corruptions like Snow and Rain, outperforming baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Build more reliable deep learning systems by addressing robustness to natural corruptions, which is crucial for safety-sensitive domains.

Method: Model-based training with learned nuisance variation models, combining random coverage and adversarial refinement strategies.

Result: Model-based approaches showed stronger robustness to corruptions than Vanilla, Adversarial Training, and AugMix. Adversarial methods were computationally expensive, while data augmentation methods achieved comparable robustness efficiently.

Conclusion: Learned nuisance models enhance robustness to natural variability, paving the way for resilient and calibrated models under challenging real-world conditions.

Abstract: Robustness to natural corruptions remains a critical challenge for reliable deep learning, particularly in safety-sensitive domains. We study a family of model-based training approaches that leverage a learned nuisance variation model to generate realistic corruptions, as well as new hybrid strategies that combine random coverage with adversarial refinement in nuisance space. Using the Challenging Unreal and Real Environments for Traffic Sign Recognition dataset (CURE-TSR), with Snow and Rain corruptions, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and training complexity across corruption severities. Our results show that model-based methods consistently outperform baselines Vanilla, Adversarial Training, and AugMix baselines, with model-based adversarial training providing the strongest robustness under across all corruptions but at the expense of higher computation and model-based data augmentation achieving comparable robustness with $T$ less computational complexity without incurring a statistically significant drop in performance. These findings highlight the importance of learned nuisance models for capturing natural variability, and suggest a promising path toward more resilient and calibrated models under challenging conditions.

*Jamie Magrill,Leah Gornstein,Sandra Seekins,Barry Magrill*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenAI tools are widely used for architectural imagery but show limited accuracy and recurring misrepresentations when tested with architectural prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper explores the ability of GenAI text-to-image platforms to produce accurate architectural imagery within a historically detail-oriented field.

Method: Five GenAI platforms were evaluated using 30 architectural prompts, generating 600 images; these were assessed by architectural historians for accuracy based on predefined criteria.

Result: GenAI platforms showed limited accuracy, with a mean performance of 42%. Common prompts were significantly more accurate than rare ones. Specific platforms varied in failure rates, with recurring issues like over-embellishment and misrepresentation.

Conclusion: There is a need for proper labeling of AI-generated content, improved training datasets, and careful use of GenAI in educational contexts for architectural design.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) text-to-image systems are increasingly used to generate architectural imagery, yet their capacity to reproduce accurate images in a historically rule-bound field remains poorly characterized. We evaluated five widely used GenAI image platforms (Adobe Firefly, DALL-E 3, Google Imagen 3, Microsoft Image Generator, and Midjourney) using 30 architectural prompts spanning styles, typologies, and codified elements. Each prompt-generator pair produced four images (n = 600 images total). Two architectural historians independently scored each image for accuracy against predefined criteria, resolving disagreements by consensus. Set-level performance was summarized as zero to four accurate images per four-image set. Image output from Common prompts was 2.7-fold more accurate than from Rare prompts (p < 0.05). Across platforms, overall accuracy was limited (highest accuracy score 52 percent; lowest 32 percent; mean 42 percent). All-correct (4 out of 4) outcomes were similar across platforms. By contrast, all-incorrect (0 out of 4) outcomes varied substantially, with Imagen 3 exhibiting the fewest failures and Microsoft Image Generator exhibiting the highest number of failures. Qualitative review of the image dataset identified recurring patterns including over-embellishment, confusion between medieval styles and their later revivals, and misrepresentation of descriptive prompts (for example, egg-and-dart, banded column, pendentive). These findings support the need for visible labeling of GenAI synthetic content, provenance standards for future training datasets, and cautious educational use of GenAI architectural imagery.

TL;DR: This paper presents N-EIoU YOLOv9, a lightweight object detection framework targeting agricultural disease imagery detection, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is to improve small and low-contrast target detection accuracy in agricultural disease imagery using lightweight and efficient methods tailored for edge deployment.

Method: The authors propose N EIoU, a novel bounding box regression loss that combines non-monotonic gradient focusing and width-height optimization, integrated into a lightweight YOLOv9t architecture for closed deployment scenarios.

Result: N EIoU YOLOv9 achieves a 4.3% improvement in mean Average Precision compared to CIoU, with improved localization accuracy and efficient deployment (156 ms/frame) using TensorFlow Lite.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enhances localization accuracy and balances computational efficiency, proving suitable for practical edge-based agricultural disease detection systems.

Abstract: In this work, we propose N EIoU YOLOv9, a lightweight detection framework based on a signal aware bounding box regression loss derived from non monotonic gradient focusing and geometric decoupling principles, referred to as N EIoU (Non monotonic Efficient Intersection over Union). The proposed loss reshapes localization gradients by combining non monotonic focusing with decoupled width and height optimization, thereby enhancing weak regression signals for hard samples with low overlap while reducing gradient interference. This design is particularly effective for small and low contrast targets commonly observed in agricultural disease imagery. The proposed N EIoU loss is integrated into a lightweight YOLOv9t architecture and evaluated on a self collected field dataset comprising 5908 rice leaf images across four disease categories and healthy leaves. Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance gains over the standard CIoU loss, achieving a mean Average Precision of 90.3 percent, corresponding to a 4.3 percent improvement over the baseline, with improved localization accuracy under stricter evaluation criteria. For practical validation, the optimized model is deployed on an Android device using TensorFlow Lite with Float16 quantization, achieving an average inference time of 156 milliseconds per frame while maintaining accuracy. These results confirm that the proposed approach effectively balances accuracy, optimization stability, and computational efficiency for edge based agricultural monitoring systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework using knowledge distillation to convert high-capacity medical image segmentation models into efficient, scalable models compatible with existing clinical systems. Results show significant parameter reduction while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of deploying high-capacity medical image segmentation models in clinical environments with limited computational resources and restrictions on cloud-based inference.

Method: The method involves leveraging knowledge distillation to create compact, efficient student models from high-performing teacher models while maintaining compatibility with current clinical systems.

Result: The distilled model achieved 94% parameter reduction and maintained 98.7% of the teacher model's segmentation accuracy. It also reduced CPU inference latency by 67%, demonstrating efficiency gains with no deployment overhead.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation enables the creation of practical, scalable, and deployment-ready segmentation models for resource-constrained clinical workflows, ensuring long-term maintainability.

Abstract: Deploying medical image segmentation models in routine clinical workflows is often constrained by on-premises infrastructure, where computational resources are fixed and cloud-based inference may be restricted by governance and security policies. While high-capacity models achieve strong segmentation accuracy, their computational demands hinder practical deployment and long-term maintainability in hospital environments. We present a deployment-oriented framework that leverages knowledge distillation to translate a high-performing segmentation model into a scalable family of compact student models, without modifying the inference pipeline. The proposed approach preserves architectural compatibility with existing clinical systems while enabling systematic capacity reduction. The framework is evaluated on a multi-site brain MRI dataset comprising 1,104 3D volumes, with independent testing on 101 curated cases, and is further examined on abdominal CT to assess cross-modality generalizability. Under aggressive parameter reduction (94%), the distilled student model preserves nearly all of the teacher's segmentation accuracy (98.7%), while achieving substantial efficiency gains, including up to a 67% reduction in CPU inference latency without additional deployment overhead. These results demonstrate that knowledge distillation provides a practical and reliable pathway for converting research-grade segmentation models into maintainable, deployment-ready components for on-premises clinical workflows in real-world health systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Point-Seg, a transformer-based segmentation framework incorporating point tracking for myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos, which enhances temporal consistency and accuracy, especially with low-quality data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods for myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos, including independent frame processing and error-prone memory-based feature propagation.

Method: Proposes Point-Seg, a transformer-based segmentation framework using a point-tracking module trained on synthetic data to provide motion-aware signals for consistent segmentation, along with a temporal smoothing loss.

Result: Point-Seg achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art models in high-quality echocardiography data and outperforms them on lower quality data with better temporal stability. It also provides pixel-level myocardium motion information suitable for downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Point-Seg effectively utilizes point tracking for consistent video segmentation, demonstrating high reliability and generalizability for myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos.

Abstract: Purpose: Myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos is a challenging task due to low contrast, noise, and anatomical variability. Traditional deep learning models either process frames independently, ignoring temporal information, or rely on memory-based feature propagation, which accumulates error over time. Methods: We propose Point-Seg, a transformer-based segmentation framework that integrates point tracking as a temporal cue to ensure stable and consistent segmentation of myocardium across frames. Our method leverages a point-tracking module trained on a synthetic echocardiography dataset to track key anatomical landmarks across video sequences. These tracked trajectories provide an explicit motion-aware signal that guides segmentation, reducing drift and eliminating the need for memory-based feature accumulation. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal smoothing loss to further enhance temporal consistency across frames. Results: We evaluate our approach on both public and private echocardiography datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Point-Seg has statistically similar accuracy in terms of Dice to state-of-the-art segmentation models in high quality echo data, while it achieves better segmentation accuracy in lower quality echo with improved temporal stability. Furthermore, Point-Seg has the key advantage of pixel-level myocardium motion information as opposed to other segmentation methods. Such information is essential in the computation of other downstream tasks such as myocardial strain measurement and regional wall motion abnormality detection. Conclusion: Point-Seg demonstrates that point tracking can serve as an effective temporal cue for consistent video segmentation, offering a reliable and generalizable approach for myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos.

TL;DR: This paper introduces PaGKD, a framework for cross-modal knowledge distillation enabling WLI models to benefit from NBI data without requiring paired images of the same lesion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for enhancing WLI models with NBI data rely on expensive paired lesion images, leaving much clinical data unused due to practical and cost constraints.

Method: The paper proposes PaGKD, utilizing two modules: GKD-Pro for extracting group-level semantic prototypes and GKD-Den for dense cross-modal alignment using group-aware attention and relation maps.

Result: PaGKD outperforms state-of-the-art methods with significant relative AUC improvements across four clinical datasets.

Conclusion: PaGKD demonstrates effective cross-modal learning from unpaired data, setting a new benchmark for utilizing vast clinical datasets without requiring pair-wise alignment.

Abstract: White-Light Imaging (WLI) is the standard for endoscopic cancer screening, but Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI) offers superior diagnostic details. A key challenge is transferring knowledge from NBI to enhance WLI-only models, yet existing methods are critically hampered by their reliance on paired NBI-WLI images of the same lesion, a costly and often impractical requirement that leaves vast amounts of clinical data untapped. In this paper, we break this paradigm by introducing PaGKD, a novel Pairing-free Group-level Knowledge Distillation framework that that enables effective cross-modal learning using unpaired WLI and NBI data. Instead of forcing alignment between individual, often semantically mismatched image instances, PaGKD operates at the group level to distill more complete and compatible knowledge across modalities. Central to PaGKD are two complementary modules: (1) Group-level Prototype Distillation (GKD-Pro) distills compact group representations by extracting modality-invariant semantic prototypes via shared lesion-aware queries; (2) Group-level Dense Distillation (GKD-Den) performs dense cross-modal alignment by guiding group-aware attention with activation-derived relation maps. Together, these modules enforce global semantic consistency and local structural coherence without requiring image-level correspondence. Extensive experiments on four clinical datasets demonstrate that PaGKD consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving relative AUC improvements of 3.3%, 1.1%, 2.8%, and 3.2%, respectively, establishing a new direction for cross-modal learning from unpaired data.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for predicting affordance on complete object shapes, including unobserved areas, using RGBD images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques only predict affordance regions on visible surfaces, leaving unobserved areas unexplored.

Method: The authors propose Affostruction, featuring multi-view reconstruction, flow-based grounding for distribution ambiguity, and active view selection using affordance predictions.

Result: Affostruction improves affordance grounding accuracy by 40.4% (19.1 aIoU) and 3D reconstruction accuracy by 67.7% (32.67 IoU).

Conclusion: This framework successfully integrates complete geometric reconstruction with affordance grounding, enhancing prediction accuracy for unobserved regions.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of affordance grounding from RGBD images of an object, which aims to localize surface regions corresponding to a text query that describes an action on the object. While existing methods predict affordance regions only on visible surfaces, we propose Affostruction, a generative framework that reconstructs complete geometry from partial observations and grounds affordances on the full shape including unobserved regions. We make three core contributions: generative multi-view reconstruction via sparse voxel fusion that extrapolates unseen geometry while maintaining constant token complexity, flow-based affordance grounding that captures inherent ambiguity in affordance distributions, and affordance-driven active view selection that leverages predicted affordances for intelligent viewpoint sampling. Affostruction achieves 19.1 aIoU on affordance grounding (40.4\% improvement) and 32.67 IoU for 3D reconstruction (67.7\% improvement), enabling accurate affordance prediction on complete shapes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces COOL-SD, a method for faster autoregressive image generation with competitive or improved quality using annealed speculative decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses the inefficiency of inference in autoregressive (AR) image generation caused by its sequential nature and ambiguity of image tokens, even with current speculative decoding techniques.

Method: COOL-SD is proposed as an annealed relaxation of speculative decoding. It includes theoretical grounding on total variation distance, optimal resampling distribution to minimize this distance, and perturbation analysis to design an annealing mechanism.

Result: COOL-SD improves image generation speed while maintaining comparable quality, or improves image quality with similar latency. Experimental results show superior speed-quality trade-offs compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed COOL-SD method achieves better efficiency and quality in autoregressive image generation, validated through theoretical insights and experimental analysis.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in autoregressive image generation, inference remains slow due to the sequential nature of AR models and the ambiguity of image tokens, even when using speculative decoding. Recent works attempt to address this with relaxed speculative decoding but lack theoretical grounding. In this paper, we establish the theoretical basis of relaxed SD and propose COOL-SD, an annealed relaxation of speculative decoding built on two key insights. The first analyzes the total variation (TV) distance between the target model and relaxed speculative decoding and yields an optimal resampling distribution that minimizes an upper bound of the distance. The second uses perturbation analysis to reveal an annealing behaviour in relaxed speculative decoding, motivating our annealed design. Together, these insights enable COOL-SD to generate images faster with comparable quality, or achieve better quality at similar latency. Experiments validate the effectiveness of COOL-SD, showing consistent improvements over prior methods in speed-quality trade-offs.

Conclusion: SpikeVAEDiff achieves high-quality image reconstruction from neural data and identifies the VISI region’s importance, validating the model’s effectiveness in neuroscience applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing natural visual scenes from neural activity is a key challenge in neuroscience and computer vision. We present SpikeVAEDiff, a novel two-stage framework that combines a Very Deep Variational Autoencoder (VDVAE) and the Versatile Diffusion model to generate high-resolution and semantically meaningful image reconstructions from neural spike data. In the first stage, VDVAE produces low-resolution preliminary reconstructions by mapping neural spike signals to latent representations. In the second stage, regression models map neural spike signals to CLIP-Vision and CLIP-Text features, enabling Versatile Diffusion to refine the images via image-to-image generation.
  We evaluate our approach on the Allen Visual Coding-Neuropixels dataset and analyze different brain regions. Our results show that the VISI region exhibits the most prominent activation and plays a key role in reconstruction quality. We present both successful and unsuccessful reconstruction examples, reflecting the challenges of decoding neural activity. Compared with fMRI-based approaches, spike data provides superior temporal and spatial resolution. We further validate the effectiveness of the VDVAE model and conduct ablation studies demonstrating that data from specific brain regions significantly enhances reconstruction performance.

*Fan Liu,Ting Wu,Chuanyi Zhang,Liang Yao,Xing Ma,Yuhui Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a vision-language technique to improve infrared object detection by leveraging textual supervision for better feature disentanglement and detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared object detection struggles due to low contrast and weak edge information in images, making robust feature extraction difficult in complex environments.

Method: The authors propose a new paradigm with two modules: Semantic Feature Alignment (SFA) for aligning object features with text features, and Object Feature Disentanglement (OFD) to separate object and non-object features by minimizing their correlation.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with 83.7% mAP on M³FD benchmark and 86.1% mAP on the FLIR dataset.

Conclusion: Incorporating textual supervision improves feature extraction, resulting in enhanced infrared object detection performance. The proposed method is robust and effective in challenging conditions.

Abstract: Infrared object detection focuses on identifying and locating objects in complex environments (\eg, dark, snow, and rain) where visible imaging cameras are disabled by poor illumination. However, due to low contrast and weak edge information in infrared images, it is challenging to extract discriminative object features for robust detection. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel vision-language representation learning paradigm for infrared object detection. An additional textual supervision with rich semantic information is explored to guide the disentanglement of object and non-object features. Specifically, we propose a Semantic Feature Alignment (SFA) module to align the object features with the corresponding text features. Furthermore, we develop an Object Feature Disentanglement (OFD) module that disentangles text-aligned object features and non-object features by minimizing their correlation. Finally, the disentangled object features are entered into the detection head. In this manner, the detection performance can be remarkably enhanced via more discriminative and less noisy features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on two benchmarks: M\textsuperscript{3}FD (83.7\% mAP), FLIR (86.1\% mAP). Our code will be publicly available once the paper is accepted.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPOT-Face, a superpixel graph-based framework for linking forensic face identification across modalities like skeletons and sketches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forensic identification becomes difficult when DNA-based identification methods are unavailable. Existing methods like deep learning face recognition struggle in cases requiring modeling cross-domain structural correspondence.

Method: The authors propose constructing superpixel-based graphs from images and extracting their embeddings using graph neural networks. Cross-domain structural connections are modeled via attention-guided optimal transport.

Result: Experiments conducted on two datasets (IIT_Mandi_S2F and CUFS) show SPOT-Face improves identification metrics such as Recall and Mean Average Precision compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SPOT-Face is highly effective for matching forensic images such as skulls and sketches with faces, advancing forensic identification techniques.

Abstract: Person identification in forensic investigations becomes very challenging when common identification means for DNA (i.e., hair strands, soft tissue) are not available. Current methods utilize deep learning methods for face recognition. However, these methods lack effective mechanisms to model cross-domain structural correspondence between two different forensic modalities. In this paper, we introduce a SPOT-Face, a superpixel graph-based framework designed for cross-domain forensic face identification of victims using their skeleton and sketch images. Our unified framework involves constructing a superpixel-based graph from an image and then using different graph neural networks(GNNs) backbones to extract the embeddings of these graphs, while cross-domain correspondence is established through attention-guided optimal transport mechanism. We have evaluated our proposed framework on two publicly available dataset: IIT\_Mandi\_S2F (S2F) and CUFS. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate our proposed framework. The experimental results show significant improvement in identification metrics ( i.e., Recall, mAP) over existing graph-based baselines. Furthermore, our framework demonstrates to be highly effective for matching skulls and sketches to faces in forensic investigations.

Conclusion: CLIDD demonstrates a scalable and efficient solution for high-precision local feature matching, suitable for real-time spatial intelligence tasks under diverse deployment constraints.

Abstract: Robust local feature representations are essential for spatial intelligence tasks such as robot navigation and augmented reality. Establishing reliable correspondences requires descriptors that provide both high discriminative power and computational efficiency. To address this, we introduce Cross-Layer Independent Deformable Description (CLIDD), a method that achieves superior distinctiveness by sampling directly from independent feature hierarchies. This approach utilizes learnable offsets to capture fine-grained structural details across scales while bypassing the computational burden of unified dense representations. To ensure real-time performance, we implement a hardware-aware kernel fusion strategy that maximizes inference throughput. Furthermore, we develop a scalable framework that integrates lightweight architectures with a training protocol leveraging both metric learning and knowledge distillation. This scheme generates a wide spectrum of model variants optimized for diverse deployment constraints. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves superior matching accuracy and exceptional computational efficiency simultaneously. Specifically, the ultra-compact variant matches the precision of SuperPoint while utilizing only 0.004M parameters, achieving a 99.7% reduction in model size. Furthermore, our high-performance configuration outperforms all current state-of-the-art methods, including high-capacity DINOv2-based frameworks, while exceeding 200 FPS on edge devices. These results demonstrate that CLIDD delivers high-precision local feature matching with minimal computational overhead, providing a robust and scalable solution for real-time spatial intelligence tasks.

*Jackie Alex,Justin Petter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles the issue of generating annotated samples to detect defects in substation meters using a novel synthesis framework. It incorporates Knowledge Embedding and Hypernetwork-Guided Control to improve defect image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Substation meters face difficulty in defect detection due to a lack of annotated samples, which hampers stable power grid operation. The motivation arises from the need for effective data synthesis for industrial defect detection.

Method: The proposed framework fine-tunes Stable Diffusion models using DreamBooth-style learning, integrates a geometric crack modeling module for spatially controlled defect generation, and uses a hypernetwork to balance fidelity and controllability in the generation process.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in metrics like FID (32.7% reduction) and defect detector mAP (15.3% increase), outperforming existing data augmentation baselines.

Conclusion: The framework solves the challenge of few-shot data generation, offering a realistic and controllable image synthesis approach for improving industrial defect detection in scenarios with scarce sample availability.

Abstract: Substation meters play a critical role in monitoring and ensuring the stable operation of power grids, yet their detection of cracks and other physical defects is often hampered by a severe scarcity of annotated samples. To address this few-shot generation challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates Knowledge Embedding and Hypernetwork-Guided Conditional Control into a Stable Diffusion pipeline, enabling realistic and controllable synthesis of defect images from limited data.
  First, we bridge the substantial domain gap between natural-image pre-trained models and industrial equipment by fine-tuning a Stable Diffusion backbone using DreamBooth-style knowledge embedding. This process encodes the unique structural and textural priors of substation meters, ensuring generated images retain authentic meter characteristics.
  Second, we introduce a geometric crack modeling module that parameterizes defect attributes--such as location, length, curvature, and branching pattern--to produce spatially constrained control maps. These maps provide precise, pixel-level guidance during generation.
  Third, we design a lightweight hypernetwork that dynamically modulates the denoising process of the diffusion model in response to the control maps and high-level defect descriptors, achieving a flexible balance between generation fidelity and controllability.
  Extensive experiments on a real-world substation meter dataset demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing augmentation and generation baselines. It reduces Frechet Inception Distance (FID) by 32.7%, increases diversity metrics, and--most importantly--boosts the mAP of a downstream defect detector by 15.3% when trained on augmented data. The framework offers a practical, high-quality data synthesis solution for industrial inspection systems where defect samples are rare.

TL;DR: The authors introduce DeTracker, a framework for multi-object tracking in unstabilized satellite videos, which performs better than existing solutions by addressing motion and appearance challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multi-object tracking in satellite videos affected by platform jitter and weak appearance of tiny objects, which degrade tracking performance.

Method: DeTracker is introduced as a detection-and-tracking framework with two key modules: Global--Local Motion Decoupling (GLMD) for separating platform and object motion, and Temporal Dependency Feature Pyramid (TDFP) for cross-frame temporal feature fusion. A benchmark dataset, SDM-Car-SU, was also created.

Result: DeTracker outperforms previous methods with results of 61.1% MOTA on simulated SDM-Car-SU data and 47.3% MOTA on real satellite videos.

Conclusion: DeTracker effectively enhances tracking in unstabilized satellite videos by addressing platform motion and improving tiny-object representations, offering a robust solution for challenging conditions.

Abstract: Satellite videos provide continuous observations of surface dynamics but pose significant challenges for multi-object tracking (MOT), especially under unstabilized conditions where platform jitter and the weak appearance of tiny objects jointly degrade tracking performance. To address this problem, we propose DeTracker, a joint detection-and-tracking framework tailored for unstabilized satellite videos. DeTracker introduces a Global--Local Motion Decoupling (GLMD) module that explicitly separates satellite platform motion from true object motion through global alignment and local refinement, leading to improved trajectory stability and motion estimation accuracy. In addition, a Temporal Dependency Feature Pyramid (TDFP) module is developed to perform cross-frame temporal feature fusion, enhancing the continuity and discriminability of tiny-object representations. We further construct a new benchmark dataset, SDM-Car-SU, which simulates multi-directional and multi-speed platform motions to enable systematic evaluation of tracking robustness under varying motion perturbations. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real unstabilized satellite videos demonstrate that DeTracker significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 61.1% MOTA on SDM-Car-SU and 47.3% MOTA on real satellite video data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Adaptive Anisotropic Textured Gaussians (A$^2$TG), which improve 3D scene rendering by reducing memory usage and enhancing image quality compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for textured Gaussian Splatting use fixed square textures, which are inefficient in memory usage and cannot adapt to the variable details of scenes.

Method: The method introduces anisotropic textures for Gaussians, with gradient-guided adaptation to determine texture resolution and aspect ratio dynamically, allowing for detail-aware and efficient resource allocation.

Result: A$^2$TG demonstrates better rendering fidelity with significantly reduced memory usage compared to fixed-texture Gaussian Splatting methods across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: Adaptive anisotropic textured Gaussians improve efficiency and adaptability in representing 3D scenes, offering a balance between high-quality rendering and resource utilization.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful representation for high-quality, real-time 3D scene rendering. While recent works extend Gaussians with learnable textures to enrich visual appearance, existing approaches allocate a fixed square texture per primitive, leading to inefficient memory usage and limited adaptability to scene variability. In this paper, we introduce adaptive anisotropic textured Gaussians (A$^2$TG), a novel representation that generalizes textured Gaussians by equipping each primitive with an anisotropic texture. Our method employs a gradient-guided adaptive rule to jointly determine texture resolution and aspect ratio, enabling non-uniform, detail-aware allocation that aligns with the anisotropic nature of Gaussian splats. This design significantly improves texture efficiency, reducing memory consumption while enhancing image quality. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that A TG consistently outperforms fixed-texture Gaussian Splatting methods, achieving comparable rendering fidelity with substantially lower memory requirements.

*Yiwei Zhang,Jin Gao,Hanshi Wang,Fudong Ge,Guan Luo,Weiming Hu,Zhipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoRA-DETR, a method to improve DETR-style object detectors by employing diverse one-to-many label assignment strategies, enhancing supervisory signal while maintaining simplicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the slow convergence issue in DETR-style detectors caused by the sparse supervision of the one-to-one matching strategy, improving efficiency without sacrificing simplicity.

Method: The proposed LoRA-DETR uses multiple lightweight Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) branches to implement diverse one-to-many label assignment strategies during training, which are discarded during inference to preserve computational efficiency.

Result: LoRA-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple baselines by integrating diverse supervisory signals while maintaining the original DETR architecture's elegance.

Conclusion: Diversifying label assignment strategies in DETR detectors optimizes performance without introducing significant architectural complexity or additional computation during inference.

Abstract: Label assignment is a critical component in object detectors, particularly within DETR-style frameworks where the one-to-one matching strategy, despite its end-to-end elegance, suffers from slow convergence due to sparse supervision. While recent works have explored one-to-many assignments to enrich supervisory signals, they often introduce complex, architecture-specific modifications and typically focus on a single auxiliary strategy, lacking a unified and scalable design. In this paper, we first systematically investigate the effects of ``one-to-many'' supervision and reveal a surprising insight that performance gains are driven not by the sheer quantity of supervision, but by the diversity of the assignment strategies employed. This finding suggests that a more elegant, parameter-efficient approach is attainable. Building on this insight, we propose LoRA-DETR, a flexible and lightweight framework that seamlessly integrates diverse assignment strategies into any DETR-style detector. Our method augments the primary network with multiple Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) branches during training, each instantiating a different one-to-many assignment rule. These branches act as auxiliary modules that inject rich, varied supervisory gradients into the main model and are discarded during inference, thus incurring no additional computational cost. This design promotes robust joint optimization while maintaining the architectural simplicity of the original detector. Extensive experiments on different baselines validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our work presents a new paradigm for enhancing detectors, demonstrating that diverse ``one-to-many'' supervision can be integrated to achieve state-of-the-art results without compromising model elegance.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a compact and robust visual place recognition (VPR) model combining event-based vision sensors with a guided variational autoencoder (VAE) for mobile robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing VPR models which either require too much memory or lack robustness and generalization, particularly in GPS-denied indoor environments.

Method: The model uses event-based vision sensors combined with a guided VAE. The encoder is built on a spiking neural network, compatible with low-latency, power-efficient neuromorphic hardware.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art classification performance across 16 distinct places in a new indoor VPR dataset, demonstrating robustness under varied illumination and generalization to unseen scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed guided VAE model enhances accuracy, efficiency, and generalization in indoor visual place recognition, paving the way for improved mobile robot navigation in diverse environments.

Abstract: Autonomous agents such as cars, robots and drones need to precisely localize themselves in diverse environments, including in GPS-denied indoor environments. One approach for precise localization is visual place recognition (VPR), which estimates the place of an image based on previously seen places. State-of-the-art VPR models require high amounts of memory, making them unwieldy for mobile deployment, while more compact models lack robustness and generalization capabilities. This work overcomes these limitations for robotics using a combination of event-based vision sensors and an event-based novel guided variational autoencoder (VAE). The encoder part of our model is based on a spiking neural network model which is compatible with power-efficient low latency neuromorphic hardware. The VAE successfully disentangles the visual features of 16 distinct places in our new indoor VPR dataset with a classification performance comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches while, showing robust performance also under various illumination conditions. When tested with novel visual inputs from unknown scenes, our model can distinguish between these places, which demonstrates a high generalization capability by learning the essential features of location. Our compact and robust guided VAE with generalization capabilities poses a promising model for visual place recognition that can significantly enhance mobile robot navigation in known and unknown indoor environments.

TL;DR: A novel three-stage pipeline, PhyRPR, improves video generation by decoupling physical reasoning and visual synthesis for better adherence to physical constraints in generated videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models struggle with physical constraints due to entangled high-level reasoning and visual synthesis.

Method: A three-stage training-free pipeline: PhyReason performs physical state reasoning and keyframe synthesis, PhyPlan creates a coarse motion scaffold, and PhyRefine integrates the scaffold into diffusion sampling for refined appearance.

Result: The approach improves physical plausibility and motion controllability in video generation, as demonstrated by experiments under physics constraints.

Conclusion: Decoupling physical reasoning from visual synthesis enhances the realism and control of diffusion-based video generation models.

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based video generation models can synthesize visually plausible videos, yet they often struggle to satisfy physical constraints. A key reason is that most existing approaches remain single-stage: they entangle high-level physical understanding with low-level visual synthesis, making it hard to generate content that require explicit physical reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free three-stage pipeline,\textit{PhyRPR}:\textit{Phy\uline{R}eason}--\textit{Phy\uline{P}lan}--\textit{Phy\uline{R}efine}, which decouples physical understanding from visual synthesis. Specifically, \textit{PhyReason} uses a large multimodal model for physical state reasoning and an image generator for keyframe synthesis; \textit{PhyPlan} deterministically synthesizes a controllable coarse motion scaffold; and \textit{PhyRefine} injects this scaffold into diffusion sampling via a latent fusion strategy to refine appearance while preserving the planned dynamics. This staged design enables explicit physical control during generation. Extensive experiments under physics constraints show that our method consistently improves physical plausibility and motion controllability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for wildfire area mapping struggle due to the trade-off between high spatial resolution and frequent temporal revisits by satellites, resulting in challenges for operational use.

Method: This paper presents BAM-MRCD, a deep learning model that utilizes multi-source imagery from MODIS and Sentinel-2 satellites, combining high spatial and temporal resolution to create precise burnt area maps promptly after wildfires.

Result: The BAM-MRCD model achieves high accuracy in detecting small-scale wildfires and outperforms existing change detection and baseline models.

Conclusion: The model offers a promising solution for operational wildfire mapping, with the potential for real-world application, and its resources are openly shared for further development.

Abstract: Delineating wildfire affected areas using satellite imagery remains challenging due to irregular and spatially heterogeneous spectral changes across the electromagnetic spectrum. While recent deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy when high-resolution multispectral data are available, their applicability in operational settings, where a quick delineation of the burn scar shortly after a wildfire incident is required, is limited by the trade-off between spatial resolution and temporal revisit frequency of current satellite systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel deep learning model, namely BAM-MRCD, which employs multi-resolution, multi-source satellite imagery (MODIS and Sentinel-2) for the timely production of detailed burnt area maps with high spatial and temporal resolution. Our model manages to detect even small scale wildfires with high accuracy, surpassing similar change detection models as well as solid baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the precision limitations of large models like SAM in brain parcellation tasks and provide a tailored solution for subdividing the brain into fine-grained regions.

Method: The method integrates U-Net skip connections and specialized modules into SAM's encoder and decoder to improve anatomical precision, using a hybrid encoder, multi-scale attention decoder, pyramid pooling, and boundary refinement.

Result: BrainSegNet demonstrated superior performance on the Human Connectome Project dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness for multi-label parcellation.

Conclusion: BrainSegNet effectively addresses precision challenges in brain MRI parcellation, offering an advanced solution through innovations in model architecture.

Abstract: Whole-brain parcellation from MRI is a critical yet challenging task due to the complexity of subdividing the brain into numerous small, irregular shaped regions. Traditionally, template-registration methods were used, but recent advances have shifted to deep learning for faster workflows. While large models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer transferable feature representations, they are not tailored for the high precision required in brain parcellation. To address this, we propose BrainSegNet, a novel framework that adapts SAM for accurate whole-brain parcellation into 95 regions. We enhance SAM by integrating U-Net skip connections and specialized modules into its encoder and decoder, enabling fine-grained anatomical precision. Key components include a hybrid encoder combining U-Net skip connections with SAM's transformer blocks, a multi-scale attention decoder with pyramid pooling for varying-sized structures, and a boundary refinement module to sharpen edges. Experimental results on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate that BrainSegNet outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in complex, multi-label parcellation.

TL;DR: GaussianFluent improves 3D Gaussian Splatting for photorealistic rendering and brittle fracture simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods for representing brittle fracture scenarios and realistic interior textures.

Method: It combines internal Gaussian densification via generative models and optimized Continuum Damage Material Point Method (CD-MPM) for accelerated brittle fracture simulation.

Result: GaussianFluent successfully simulates mixed-material objects, multi-stage fractures, and achieves real-time rendering with structurally consistent interiors.

Conclusion: The framework enables highly realistic rendering and fracture simulation, making it suitable for applications like VR and robotics.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a prominent 3D representation for high-fidelity and real-time rendering. Prior work has coupled physics simulation with Gaussians, but predominantly targets soft, deformable materials, leaving brittle fracture largely unresolved. This stems from two key obstacles: the lack of volumetric interiors with coherent textures in GS representation, and the absence of fracture-aware simulation methods for Gaussians. To address these challenges, we introduce GaussianFluent, a unified framework for realistic simulation and rendering of dynamic object states. First, it synthesizes photorealistic interiors by densifying internal Gaussians guided by generative models. Second, it integrates an optimized Continuum Damage Material Point Method (CD-MPM) to enable brittle fracture simulation at remarkably high speed. Our approach handles complex scenarios including mixed-material objects and multi-stage fracture propagation, achieving results infeasible with previous methods. Experiments clearly demonstrate GaussianFluent's capability for photo-realistic, real-time rendering with structurally consistent interiors, highlighting its potential for downstream application, such as VR and Robotics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Domain-specific Image Captioning Model (DICModel) for the ICT industry, trained using a multi-stage strategy, improving multi-modal understanding and demonstrating superior performance in accuracy and BLEU scores compared to state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to bridge the gap between textual and visual domain knowledge in the ICT industry, which traditional and existing multi-modal LLMs cannot effectively capture.

Method: A progressive multi-stage training strategy synthesizing image-text pairs and leveraging expert annotations and instruction-based fine-tuning to develop a robust domain-specific image captioning model.

Result: The DICModel, with 7B parameters, outperforms state-of-the-art models with 32B parameters, showing improvements in BLEU metrics (~56.8% and ~20.8%) and accuracy rate on ICT-specific objective questions.

Conclusion: DICModel effectively extracts logical text from images, contributing to advancing the understanding and development of multi-modal models specific to the ICT domain.

Abstract: In the information and communications technology (ICT) industry, training a domain-specific large language model (LLM) or constructing a retrieval-augmented generation system requires a substantial amount of high-value domain knowledge. However, the knowledge is not only hidden in the textual modality but also in the image modality. Traditional methods can parse text from domain documents but dont have image captioning ability. Multi-modal LLM (MLLM) can understand images, but they do not have sufficient domain knowledge. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multi-stage progressive training strategy to train a Domain-specific Image Captioning Model (DICModel) in ICT, and constructs a standard evaluation system to validate the performance of DICModel. Specifically, this work first synthesizes about 7K image-text pairs by combining the Mermaid tool and LLMs, which are used for the first-stage supervised-fine-tuning (SFT) of DICModel. Then, ICT-domain experts manually annotate about 2K image-text pairs for the second-stage SFT of DICModel. Finally, experts and LLMs jointly synthesize about 1.5K visual question answering data for the instruction-based SFT. Experimental results indicate that our DICModel with only 7B parameters performs better than other state-of-the-art models with 32B parameters. Compared to the SOTA models with 7B and 32B parameters, our DICModel increases the BLEU metric by approximately 56.8% and 20.8%, respectively. On the objective questions constructed by ICT domain experts, our DICModel outperforms Qwen2.5-VL 32B by 1% in terms of accuracy rate. In summary, this work can efficiently and accurately extract the logical text from images, which is expected to promote the development of multimodal models in the ICT domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel frequency error-guided framework for multi-contrast MRI reconstruction to address limitations like suboptimal reference fusion, underuse of reference information, and fixed undersampling patterns, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of long acquisition times and motion artifacts in MRI by improving multi-contrast reconstruction methods, which suffer from inadequate reference fusion strategies, underutilization of complementary information, and static under-sampling patterns.

Method: The authors propose a frequency error-guided framework integrating a conditional diffusion model to learn a Frequency Error Prior (FEP). This is combined with a unified approach for optimizing sampling patterns and reconstruction networks, enhanced by deep unfolding, spatial alignment, and reference decomposition.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across imaging modalities and under acceleration rates of 4-30x, demonstrating superior performance in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

Conclusion: The study presents a pioneering frequency error-guided MRI reconstruction framework that offers efficient, interpretable solutions to major existing problems, setting a higher standard for multi-contrast MRI reconstruction.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in clinical diagnostics, yet it remains hindered by long acquisition times and motion artifacts. Multi-contrast MRI reconstruction has emerged as a promising direction by leveraging complementary information from fully-sampled reference scans. However, existing approaches suffer from three major limitations: (1) superficial reference fusion strategies, such as simple concatenation, (2) insufficient utilization of the complementary information provided by the reference contrast, and (3) fixed under-sampling patterns. We propose an efficient and interpretable frequency error-guided reconstruction framework to tackle these issues. We first employ a conditional diffusion model to learn a Frequency Error Prior (FEP), which is then incorporated into a unified framework for jointly optimizing both the under-sampling pattern and the reconstruction network. The proposed reconstruction model employs a model-driven deep unfolding framework that jointly exploits frequency- and image-domain information. In addition, a spatial alignment module and a reference feature decomposition strategy are incorporated to improve reconstruction quality and bridge model-based optimization with data-driven learning for improved physical interpretability. Comprehensive validation across multiple imaging modalities, acceleration rates (4-30x), and sampling schemes demonstrates consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

*Laure Ciernik,Marco Morik,Lukas Thede,Luca Eyring,Shinichi Nakajima,Zeynep Akata,Lukas Muttenthaler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an attentive probing mechanism for efficiently adapting pretrained foundation models to downstream tasks by leveraging representations from all layers rather than just the last layer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting large-scale foundation models to downstream tasks efficiently poses a challenge since linear probing often focuses solely on last-layer representations, under-utilizing distributed information across all layers.

Method: An attentive probing mechanism dynamically learns and fuses representations from all layers of a Vision Transformer to identify and utilize task-relevant information across the network hierarchy.

Result: The proposed method achieved substantial and consistent improvements over standard linear probes across 20 datasets and multiple pretrained models. Intermediate layer representations were identified as particularly beneficial for tasks differing from the pre-training domain.

Conclusion: Intermediate layer information is crucial for adaptation, and the presented task-aware mechanism unlocks their potential, providing a principled approach to improve probing-based adaptation processes.

Abstract: With the rise of large-scale foundation models, efficiently adapting them to downstream tasks remains a central challenge. Linear probing, which freezes the backbone and trains a lightweight head, is computationally efficient but often restricted to last-layer representations. We show that task-relevant information is distributed across the network hierarchy rather than solely encoded in any of the last layers. To leverage this distribution of information, we apply an attentive probing mechanism that dynamically fuses representations from all layers of a Vision Transformer. This mechanism learns to identify the most relevant layers for a target task and combines low-level structural cues with high-level semantic abstractions. Across 20 diverse datasets and multiple pretrained foundation models, our method achieves consistent, substantial gains over standard linear probes. Attention heatmaps further reveal that tasks different from the pre-training domain benefit most from intermediate representations. Overall, our findings underscore the value of intermediate layer information and demonstrate a principled, task aware approach for unlocking their potential in probing-based adaptation.

*Mingyu Jeon,Sungjin Han,Jinkwon Hwang,Minchol Kwon,Jonghee Kim,Junyeong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMORE is a memory-efficient video retrieval framework that enhances semantic encoding, importance modulation, and frame compression to improve performance in Video Moment Retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the inefficiency in processing lengthy videos for Video Moment Retrieval, as existing methodologies that use sparse sampling can lead to information loss.

Method: SMORE combines query-guided captioning, query-aware importance modulation, and adaptive frame compression to maintain high information resolution while being memory efficient.

Result: SMORE outperforms previous models, achieving state-of-the-art results on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and ActivityNet-Captions benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that SMORE is an effective solution for efficient and high-performance video retrieval, overcoming problems associated with dense frame processing in lengthy videos.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have improved image recognition and reasoning, but video-related tasks remain challenging due to memory constraints from dense frame processing. Existing Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) methodologies rely on sparse frame sampling, risking potential information loss, especially in lengthy videos. We propose SMORE (See MORE, store less), a framework that enhances memory efficiency while maintaining high information resolution. SMORE (1) uses query-guided captions to encode semantics aligned with user intent, (2) applies query-aware importance modulation to highlight relevant segments, and (3) adaptively compresses frames to preserve key content while reducing redundancy. This enables efficient video understanding without exceeding memory budgets. Experimental validation reveals that SMORE achieves state-of-the-art performance on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and ActivityNet-Captions benchmarks.

### [151] [Spectral Complex Autoencoder Pruning: A Fidelity-Guided Criterion for Extreme Structured Channel Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09352)
*Wei Liu,Xing Deng,Haijian Shao,Yingtao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SCAP, a reconstruction criterion to efficiently prune redundant channels in convolutional layers, achieving high compression rates with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address redundancy in convolutional networks by identifying and eliminating functionally redundant channels, improving computational efficiency without significant accuracy loss.

Method: SCAP uses a complex interaction field combining input activations and output channels, transforming it via a frequency domain autoencoder to measure channel redundancy. Channels are scored based on spectral reconstruction fidelity for pruning.

Result: Applying SCAP to VGG16 on CIFAR-10, it achieved 90.11% FLOP reduction and 96.30% parameter reduction, with only a 1.67% Top-1 accuracy drop from a 93.44% baseline after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: SCAP is an effective approach for channel-level pruning in convolutional networks, demonstrating its ability to significantly reduce computational load while preserving accuracy.

Abstract: We propose Spectral Complex Autoencoder Pruning (SCAP), a reconstruction-based criterion that measures functional redundancy at the level of individual output channels. For each convolutional layer, we construct a complex interaction field by pairing the full multi-channel input activation as the real part with a single output-channel activation (spatially aligned and broadcast across input channels) as the imaginary part. We transform this complex field to the frequency domain and train a low-capacity autoencoder to reconstruct normalized spectra. Channels whose spectra are reconstructed with high fidelity are interpreted as lying close to a low-dimensional manifold captured by the autoencoder and are therefore more compressible; conversely, channels with low fidelity are retained as they encode information that cannot be compactly represented by the learned manifold. This yields an importance score (optionally fused with the filter L1 norm) that supports simple threshold-based pruning and produces a structurally consistent pruned network. On VGG16 trained on CIFAR-10, at a fixed threshold of 0.6, we obtain 90.11% FLOP reduction and 96.30% parameter reduction with an absolute Top-1 accuracy drop of 1.67% from a 93.44% baseline after fine-tuning, demonstrating that spectral reconstruction fidelity of complex interaction fields is an effective proxy for channel-level redundancy under aggressive compression.

*Sangjun Han,Youngmi Hur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods to improve image super-resolution by enhancing high-frequency details, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple model types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the quality of super-resolution images by focusing on enhancing fine details, which is crucial for real-world applications.

Method: Proposes a Laplacian pyramid-based detail loss and a repeated upscaling and downscaling process to better focus on high-frequency components while improving super-resolution image quality.

Result: The proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on CNN models and enhance attention-based models, consistently showing improvement across experiments.

Conclusion: The approaches presented in the paper effectively enhance image super-resolution by focusing on high-frequency details and can be applied successfully across various model structures.

Abstract: With advances in artificial intelligence, image processing has gained significant interest. Image super-resolution is a vital technology closely related to real-world applications, as it enhances the quality of existing images. Since enhancing fine details is crucial for the super-resolution task, pixels that contribute to high-frequency information should be emphasized. This paper proposes two methods to enhance high-frequency details in super-resolution images: a Laplacian pyramid-based detail loss and a repeated upscaling and downscaling process. Total loss with our detail loss guides a model by separately generating and controlling super-resolution and detail images. This approach allows the model to focus more effectively on high-frequency components, resulting in improved super-resolution images. Additionally, repeated upscaling and downscaling amplify the effectiveness of the detail loss by extracting diverse information from multiple low-resolution features. We conduct two types of experiments. First, we design a CNN-based model incorporating our methods. This model achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing all currently available CNN-based and even some attention-based models. Second, we apply our methods to existing attention-based models on a small scale. In all our experiments, attention-based models adding our detail loss show improvements compared to the originals. These results demonstrate our approaches effectively enhance super-resolution images across different model structures.

*Yaxi Chen,Zi Ye,Shaheer U. Saeed,Oliver Yu,Simin Ni,Jie Huang,Yipeng Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in osteosarcoma tumor necrosis quantification with digital pathology. It introduces improved classification methods using radiomic features and hierarchical loss optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual evaluation of tumor necrosis in osteosarcoma is labor-intensive and unreliable. Automating this process could improve accuracy and efficiency.

Method: The authors propose using radiomic features as supplementary inputs to deep learning models and hierarchical loss functions for classification optimization.

Result: Incorporating radiomic features and hierarchical loss significantly improved classification performance on the TCIA OS Tumor Assessment dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer enhanced automation and accuracy in osteosarcoma tumor analysis, setting a new performance benchmark.

Abstract: Osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive primary bone malignancy. Accurate histopathological assessment of viable versus non-viable tumor regions after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is critical for prognosis and treatment planning, yet manual evaluation remains labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to inter-observer variability. Recent advances in digital pathology have enabled automated necrosis quantification. Evaluating on test data, independently sampled on patient-level, revealed that the deep learning model performance dropped significantly from the tile-level generalization ability reported in previous studies. First, this work proposes the use of radiomic features as additional input in model training. We show that, despite that they are derived from the images, such a multimodal input effectively improved the classification performance, in addition to its added benefits in interpretability. Second, this work proposes to optimize two binary classification tasks with hierarchical classes (i.e. tumor-vs-non-tumor and viable-vs-non-viable), as opposed to the alternative ``flat'' three-class classification task (i.e. non-tumor, non-viable tumor, viable tumor), thereby enabling a hierarchical loss. We show that such a hierarchical loss, with trainable weightings between the two tasks, the per-class performance can be improved significantly. Using the TCIA OS Tumor Assessment dataset, we experimentally demonstrate the benefits from each of the proposed new approaches and their combination, setting a what we consider new state-of-the-art performance on this open dataset for this application.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Video-MSR, the first benchmark specifically targeting Multi-hop Spatial Reasoning (MSR) in video contexts. It highlights existing model limitations and proposes a new dataset, MSR-9K, to improve spatial reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the underexplored domain of complex multi-hop spatial reasoning tasks in dynamic video scenarios, as most current benchmarks are limited to single-step perception tasks.

Method: The authors present Video-MSR, a benchmark with four MSR-specific tasks, and construct a dataset of 3,052 video instances via a visually-grounded and verified pipeline. They also create the MSR-9K dataset for fine-tuning.

Result: They evaluated 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, finding significant weaknesses in multi-hop spatial reasoning tasks. Fine-tuning Qwen-VL with MSR-9K improved its performance by 7.82% on Video-MSR.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that multi-hop spatial instruction tuning enhances MSR capabilities and positions Video-MSR as a critical resource for advancing research in this domain.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), drawing increasing attention and rapid advancement. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on single-step perception-to-judgment tasks, leaving scenarios requiring complex visual-spatial logical chains significantly underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-MSR, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate Multi-hop Spatial Reasoning (MSR) in dynamic video scenarios. Video-MSR systematically probes MSR capabilities through four distinct tasks: Constrained Localization, Chain-based Reference Retrieval, Route Planning, and Counterfactual Physical Deduction. Our benchmark comprises 3,052 high-quality video instances with 4,993 question-answer pairs, constructed via a scalable, visually-grounded pipeline combining advanced model generation with rigorous human verification. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations, revealing that while models demonstrate proficiency in surface-level perception, they exhibit distinct performance drops in MSR tasks, frequently suffering from spatial disorientation and hallucination during multi-step deductions. To mitigate these shortcomings and empower models with stronger MSR capabilities, we further curate MSR-9K, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset, and fine-tune Qwen-VL, achieving a +7.82% absolute improvement on Video-MSR. Our results underscore the efficacy of multi-hop spatial instruction data and establish Video-MSR as a vital foundation for future research.

### [157] [MAD: Motion Appearance Decoupling for efficient Driving World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09452)
*Ahmad Rahimi,Valentin Gerard,Eloi Zablocki,Matthieu Cord,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study proposes an efficient framework to adapt generalist video diffusion models into controllable driving world models by decoupling motion learning from appearance synthesis, achieving significant performance improvements with minimal supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion models are impressive in generating realistic videos but unsuitable for autonomous driving, lacking structured motion and physical consistency, necessitating methods that enhance their applicability in driving simulations.

Method: The framework first adapts video models to predict structured motion using simplified skeletonized representations, then reuses the model to synthesize realistic videos by adding textures and lighting, aligning with a reasoning-rendering paradigm.

Result: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results with significantly lower computational requirements (less than 6% compute), outperforming open-source models like LTX when adapted to MAD-LTX.

Conclusion: Decoupling motion inference from appearance rendering is an efficient and effective strategy to create controllable, physically coherent world models for autonomous driving, demonstrating robust performance with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Recent video diffusion models generate photorealistic, temporally coherent videos, yet they fall short as reliable world models for autonomous driving, where structured motion and physically consistent interactions are essential. Adapting these generalist video models to driving domains has shown promise but typically requires massive domain-specific data and costly fine-tuning. We propose an efficient adaptation framework that converts generalist video diffusion models into controllable driving world models with minimal supervision. The key idea is to decouple motion learning from appearance synthesis. First, the model is adapted to predict structured motion in a simplified form: videos of skeletonized agents and scene elements, focusing learning on physical and social plausibility. Then, the same backbone is reused to synthesize realistic RGB videos conditioned on these motion sequences, effectively "dressing" the motion with texture and lighting. This two-stage process mirrors a reasoning-rendering paradigm: first infer dynamics, then render appearance. Our experiments show this decoupled approach is exceptionally efficient: adapting SVD, we match prior SOTA models with less than 6% of their compute. Scaling to LTX, our MAD-LTX model outperforms all open-source competitors, and supports a comprehensive suite of text, ego, and object controls.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes cross-dataset object detection (CD-OD) and its performance inconsistencies across different training and testing dataset environments, highlighting setting-specific effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to address the significant performance degradation of object detectors when applied to benchmarks from different distributions and settings.

Method: The authors classify datasets into 'setting-agnostic' and 'setting-specific,' then evaluate detector performance across diverse train-test combinations. They identify domain shifts versus label mismatches using a closed-label and open-label protocol with CLIP similarity.

Result: Performance is relatively stable within similar settings, but degrades significantly across different settings, particularly when transferring from specific sources to agnostic targets. Open-label evaluation shows some consistent gains but remains limited.

Conclusion: The study clarifies CD-OD performance discrepancies under different settings, identifies domain shift as a key issue, and provides actionable guidance on evaluation strategies. Tools for the study are made publicly available.

Abstract: Object detectors often perform well in-distribution, yet degrade sharply on a different benchmark. We study cross-dataset object detection (CD-OD) through a lens of setting specificity. We group benchmarks into setting-agnostic datasets with diverse everyday scenes and setting-specific datasets tied to a narrow environment, and evaluate a standard detector family across all train--test pairs. This reveals a clear structure in CD-OD: transfer within the same setting type is relatively stable, while transfer across setting types drops substantially and is often asymmetric. The most severe breakdowns occur when transferring from specific sources to agnostic targets, and persist after open-label alignment, indicating that domain shift dominates in the hardest regimes. To disentangle domain shift from label mismatch, we compare closed-label transfer with an open-label protocol that maps predicted classes to the nearest target label using CLIP similarity. Open-label evaluation yields consistent but bounded gains, and many corrected cases correspond to semantic near-misses supported by the image evidence. Overall, we provide a principled characterization of CD-OD under setting specificity and practical guidance for evaluating detectors under distribution shift.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes V-DPM, extending Dynamic Point Maps (DPMs) to video-based reconstruction to capture dynamic depth and full 3D motion using VGGT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of existing DPMs restricted to image pairs by adapting them to videos to advance dynamic 3D reconstruction.

Method: It formulates DPMs for videos maximizing representational power and reuses pretrained models. It modifies VGGT, trained on static scenes, using synthetic data for dynamic 3D predictions.

Result: V-DPM achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D and 4D reconstruction for dynamic scenes, successfully recovering 3D motion and depth.

Conclusion: V-DPM demonstrates that adapting DPMs to videos and leveraging pretrained models can enhance dynamic 3D reconstruction of scenes effectively.

Abstract: Powerful 3D representations such as DUSt3R invariant point maps, which encode 3D shape and camera parameters, have significantly advanced feed forward 3D reconstruction. While point maps assume static scenes, Dynamic Point Maps (DPMs) extend this concept to dynamic 3D content by additionally representing scene motion. However, existing DPMs are limited to image pairs and, like DUSt3R, require post processing via optimization when more than two views are involved. We argue that DPMs are more useful when applied to videos and introduce V-DPM to demonstrate this. First, we show how to formulate DPMs for video input in a way that maximizes representational power, facilitates neural prediction, and enables reuse of pretrained models. Second, we implement these ideas on top of VGGT, a recent and powerful 3D reconstructor. Although VGGT was trained on static scenes, we show that a modest amount of synthetic data is sufficient to adapt it into an effective V-DPM predictor. Our approach achieves state of the art performance in 3D and 4D reconstruction for dynamic scenes. In particular, unlike recent dynamic extensions of VGGT such as P3, DPMs recover not only dynamic depth but also the full 3D motion of every point in the scene.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve facial expression recognition using embedding-based pre-training methods that avoid irrelevant video information.

Method: Utilization of Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures to train video encoders that learn embeddings without focusing on pixel-level details.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on RAVDESS, superior results on CREMA-D with +1.48 WAR, and demonstrated strong cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: Embedding-based pre-training approaches like V-JEPAs show strong potential for improving facial expression recognition systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel application of Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPAs) for Facial Expression Recognition (FER). Departing from conventional pre-training methods for video understanding that rely on pixel-level reconstructions, V-JEPAs learn by predicting embeddings of masked regions from the embeddings of unmasked regions. This enables the trained encoder to not capture irrelevant information about a given video like the color of a region of pixels in the background. Using a pre-trained V-JEPA video encoder, we train shallow classifiers using the RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RAVDESS and outperforming all other vision-based methods on CREMA-D (+1.48 WAR). Furthermore, cross-dataset evaluations reveal strong generalization capabilities, demonstrating the potential of purely embedding-based pre-training approaches to advance FER. We release our code at https://github.com/lennarteingunia/vjepa-for-fer.

*Yue Yao,Ruining Yang,Tom Gedeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hierarchical data server and bipartite mode matching (BMM) algorithm to align source and target modes for constructing optimized training sets, improving unsupervised domain adaptation results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the challenge of constructing an alternative training set when the target domain is available but real-time data annotation is not feasible, ensuring optimal model performance by reducing domain gaps.

Method: The method involves using a hierarchical data server and a bipartite mode matching (BMM) algorithm to match target modes with source modes. The matching is achieved through a one-on-one fashion, aiming to align semantic clusters effectively.

Result: Models trained using training sets derived from the BMM algorithm achieve higher accuracy and reduced domain gaps compared to traditional methods in tasks such as object re-identification and detection.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates a data-centric improvement in training set construction, complementing existing model-centric UDA methods, and achieves further performance gains when combined with methods like pseudo-labeling.

Abstract: We explore a situation in which the target domain is accessible, but real-time data annotation is not feasible. Instead, we would like to construct an alternative training set from a large-scale data server so that a competitive model can be obtained. For this problem, because the target domain usually exhibits distinct modes (i.e., semantic clusters representing data distribution), if the training set does not contain these target modes, the model performance would be compromised. While prior existing works improve algorithms iteratively, our research explores the often-overlooked potential of optimizing the structure of the data server. Inspired by the hierarchical nature of web search engines, we introduce a hierarchical data server, together with a bipartite mode matching algorithm (BMM) to align source and target modes. For each target mode, we look in the server data tree for the best mode match, which might be large or small in size. Through bipartite matching, we aim for all target modes to be optimally matched with source modes in a one-on-one fashion. Compared with existing training set search algorithms, we show that the matched server modes constitute training sets that have consistently smaller domain gaps with the target domain across object re-identification (re-ID) and detection tasks. Consequently, models trained on our searched training sets have higher accuracy than those trained otherwise. BMM allows data-centric unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) orthogonal to existing model-centric UDA methods. By combining the BMM with existing UDA methods like pseudo-labeling, further improvement is observed.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using low-resolution visual inputs of Chinese characters as an alternative to traditional index-based representations, achieving similar accuracy and showcasing efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the visual form of logographic Chinese characters, which holds semantic and phonetic information, can enhance character-level language modeling.

Method: The authors replace traditional token IDs with grayscale images of Chinese characters (as low as 8x8 resolution) and train a decoder to process these visual inputs.

Result: Low-resolution visual inputs achieve 39.2% accuracy, comparable to index-based representation at 39.1%. Additionally, these models show faster initial progress during training (hot-start effect).

Conclusion: Minimal visual character structure provides an efficient alternative for Chinese language modeling, complementing traditional methods and revealing new approaches to character representation.

Abstract: Large language models typically represent Chinese characters as discrete index-based tokens, largely ignoring their visual form. For logographic scripts, visual structure carries semantic and phonetic information, which may aid prediction. We investigate whether low-resolution visual inputs can serve as an alternative for character-level modeling. Instead of token IDs, our decoder receives grayscale images of individual characters, with resolutions as low as $8 \times 8$ pixels. Remarkably, these inputs achieve 39.2\% accuracy, comparable to the index-based baseline of 39.1\%. Such low-resource settings also exhibit a pronounced \emph{hot-start} effect: by 0.4\% of total training, accuracy reaches above 12\%, while index-based models lag at below 6\%. Overall, our results demonstrate that minimal visual structure can provide a robust and efficient signal for Chinese language modeling, offering an alternative perspective on character representation that complements traditional index-based approaches.

Motivation: High attrition rates in longitudinal brain MRI studies pose challenges due to missing data, and existing generative models are limited in producing trustworthy and flexible brain imaging solutions.

Method: The paper proposes DF-DiffCom, a KAN-enhanced diffusion model that exploits deformation fields for improved and trustworthy image completion across various MRI modalities.

Result: DF-DiffCom surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving 5.6% improvement in PSNR and 0.12 increase in SSIM when tested on OASIS-3 data.

Conclusion: DF-DiffCom offers a reliable and versatile solution for longitudinal brain MRI completion, enhancing accuracy and extending usability to diverse MRI scenarios.

Abstract: Longitudinal brain MRI is essential for lifespan study, yet high attrition rates often lead to missing data, complicating analysis. Deep generative models have been explored, but most rely solely on image intensity, leading to two key limitations: 1) the fidelity or trustworthiness of the generated brain images are limited, making downstream studies questionable; 2) the usage flexibility is restricted due to fixed guidance rooted in the model structure, restricting full ability to versatile application scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DF-DiffCom, a Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)-enhanced diffusion model that smartly leverages deformation fields for trustworthy longitudinal brain image completion. Trained on OASIS-3, DF-DiffCom outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving PSNR by 5.6% and SSIM by 0.12. More importantly, its modality-agnostic nature allows smooth extension to varied MRI modalities, even to attribute maps such as brain tissue segmentation results.

*Sheng-Yu Huang,Jaesung Choe,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Cheng Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenVoxel introduces a training-free method for grouping and captioning sparse voxels, aiding open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding tasks like segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D scene understanding tasks by addressing the limitations of previous methods and leveraging powerful models without requiring additional training.

Method: Utilizes Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVR) for scene representation, groups voxels meaningfully, and captions them using Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) instead of training-based text encoders.

Result: Outperformed recent methods in complex referring expression segmentation tasks without any training or embedding processes.

Conclusion: OpenVoxel is an innovative and effective training-free approach to enhance 3D scene understanding, with open code access planned.

Abstract: We propose OpenVoxel, a training-free algorithm for grouping and captioning sparse voxels for the open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding tasks. Given the sparse voxel rasterization (SVR) model obtained from multi-view images of a 3D scene, our OpenVoxel is able to produce meaningful groups that describe different objects in the scene. Also, by leveraging powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), our OpenVoxel successfully build an informative scene map by captioning each group, enabling further 3D scene understanding tasks such as open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) or referring expression segmentation (RES). Unlike previous methods, our method is training-free and does not introduce embeddings from a CLIP/BERT text encoder. Instead, we directly proceed with text-to-text search using MLLMs. Through extensive experiments, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to recent studies, particularly in complex referring expression segmentation (RES) tasks. The code will be open.

### [167] [Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM) method for fine rigid pairwise 3D Point Cloud Registration: A Focus on the Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09601)
*Emmanuele Barberi,Felice Sfravara,Filippo Cucinotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM), a new metric for 3D point cloud registration, addressing challenges like density differences, noise, holes, and limited overlap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve robustness in point cloud registration methods, especially under challenging conditions such as density variations, noise, and limited overlap.

Method: The authors propose a differential entropy-based metric as the objective function for rigid pairwise 3D point cloud registration within an optimization framework.

Result: The metric demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional methods like RMSE, Chamfer distance, and Hausdorff distance in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: IDEM is a robust alternative for point cloud alignment, ensuring better results even in complex situations without requiring a fixed point cloud.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a central theme in computer vision, with alignment algorithms continuously improving for greater robustness. Commonly used methods evaluate Euclidean distances between point clouds and minimize an objective function, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). However, these approaches are most effective when the point clouds are well-prealigned and issues such as differences in density, noise, holes, and limited overlap can compromise the results. Traditional methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP), require choosing one point cloud as fixed, since Euclidean distances lack commutativity. When only one point cloud has issues, adjustments can be made, but in real scenarios, both point clouds may be affected, often necessitating preprocessing. The authors introduce a novel differential entropy-based metric, designed to serve as the objective function within an optimization framework for fine rigid pairwise 3D point cloud registration, denoted as Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM). This metric does not depend on the choice of a fixed point cloud and, during transformations, reveals a clear minimum corresponding to the best alignment. Multiple case studies are conducted, and the results are compared with those obtained using RMSE, Chamfer distance, and Hausdorff distance. The proposed metric proves effective even with density differences, noise, holes, and partial overlap, where RMSE does not always yield optimal alignment.

### [168] [GRCF: Two-Stage Groupwise Ranking and Calibration Framework for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09606)
*Manning Gao,Leheng Zhang,Shiqin Han,Haifeng Hu,Yuncheng Jiang,Sijie Mai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Two-Stage Group-wise Ranking and Calibration Framework (GRCF) to enhance Multimodal Sentiment Analysis by addressing limitations in pairwise ordinal learning and introducing adaptive strategies for robust predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal sentiment analysis methods are sensitive to label noise and lack robust relative ranking capabilities. Improvements are needed in accurately capturing sentiment orders and handling hard-to-rank samples while maintaining score calibration.

Method: The Two-Stage GRCF, inspired by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), comprises: 1) a dynamic margin ranking loss for building fine-grained ordinal structures, and 2) a MAE-driven objective for magnitude-aligned predictions. It focuses on adaptively ranking challenging samples and maintaining calibration.

Result: GRCF delivers state-of-the-art performance on regression benchmarks and exhibits strong generalizability across classification tasks like humor and sarcasm detection.

Conclusion: GRCF effectively addresses trade-offs in sentiment analysis with adaptive ranking and calibration mechanisms, achieving robust predictions and enhancing generalizability across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Most Multimodal Sentiment Analysis research has focused on point-wise regression. While straightforward, this approach is sensitive to label noise and neglects whether one sample is more positive than another, resulting in unstable predictions and poor correlation alignment. Pairwise ordinal learning frameworks emerged to address this gap, capturing relative order by learning from comparisons. Yet, they introduce two new trade-offs: First, they assign uniform importance to all comparisons, failing to adaptively focus on hard-to-rank samples. Second, they employ static ranking margins, which fail to reflect the varying semantic distances between sentiment groups. To address this, we propose a Two-Stage Group-wise Ranking and Calibration Framework (GRCF) that adapts the philosophy of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our framework resolves these trade-offs by simultaneously preserving relative ordinal structure, ensuring absolute score calibration, and adaptively focusing on difficult samples. Specifically, Stage 1 introduces a GRPO-inspired Advantage-Weighted Dynamic Margin Ranking Loss to build a fine-grained ordinal structure. Stage 2 then employs an MAE-driven objective to align prediction magnitudes. To validate its generalizability, we extend GRCF to classification tasks, including multimodal humor detection and sarcasm detection. GRCF achieves state-of-the-art performance on core regression benchmarks, while also showing strong generalizability in classification tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark called CogRail for enhanced cognitive intrusion perception in railway systems, evaluates visual-language models, and proposes a joint fine-tuning framework that improves performance in spatial-temporal reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing intrusion detection systems in railway transportation, which often fail to predict latent intrusion risks due to a narrow focus on fixed visual scopes and rule-based heuristics.

Method: The authors developed CogRail, a benchmark integrating open-source datasets with cognitively driven question-answer annotations for spatio-temporal reasoning. They evaluated state-of-the-art visual-language models and applied a joint fine-tuning framework combining position perception, movement prediction, and threat analysis.

Result: Current visual-language models were found lacking in handling complex spatial-temporal reasoning tasks. However, the proposed joint fine-tuning framework significantly improved their adaptation and performance in intrusion perception tasks.

Conclusion: Structured multi-task learning through the joint fine-tuning framework can effectively improve the accuracy and interpretability of models for domain-specific safety-critical applications like cognitive intrusion perception in railway systems.

Abstract: Accurate and early perception of potential intrusion targets is essential for ensuring the safety of railway transportation systems. However, most existing systems focus narrowly on object classification within fixed visual scopes and apply rule-based heuristics to determine intrusion status, often overlooking targets that pose latent intrusion risks. Anticipating such risks requires the cognition of spatial context and temporal dynamics for the object of interest (OOI), which presents challenges for conventional visual models. To facilitate deep intrusion perception, we introduce a novel benchmark, CogRail, which integrates curated open-source datasets with cognitively driven question-answer annotations to support spatio-temporal reasoning and prediction. Building upon this benchmark, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art visual-language models (VLMs) using multimodal prompts to identify their strengths and limitations in this domain. Furthermore, we fine-tune VLMs for better performance and propose a joint fine-tuning framework that integrates three core tasks, position perception, movement prediction, and threat analysis, facilitating effective adaptation of general-purpose foundation models into specialized models tailored for cognitive intrusion perception. Extensive experiments reveal that current large-scale multimodal models struggle with the complex spatial-temporal reasoning required by the cognitive intrusion perception task, underscoring the limitations of existing foundation models in this safety-critical domain. In contrast, our proposed joint fine-tuning framework significantly enhances model performance by enabling targeted adaptation to domain-specific reasoning demands, highlighting the advantages of structured multi-task learning in improving both accuracy and interpretability. Code will be available at https://github.com/Hub-Tian/CogRail.

TL;DR: The paper uncovers flaws in the anonymity of text-to-image (T2I) leaderboard systems, demonstrating that model outputs can be deanonymized effectively using image embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need for fair comparison of T2I models on leaderboards while preserving anonymity, a fundamental requirement in competitive AI evaluations.

Method: The authors use a centroid-based method to analyze image embedding clusters generated by different T2I models. They introduce a prompt-level distinguishability metric to assess vulnerabilities in anonymized outputs.

Result: Using 22 T2I models and 280 prompts, the method achieves high deanonymization accuracy and identifies systematic, model-specific signatures in image outputs.

Conclusion: The research highlights critical security weaknesses in anonymized T2I leaderboards, suggesting stronger anonymization defenses to ensure fairness and security.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly popular, producing a large share of AI-generated images online. To compare model quality, voting-based leaderboards have become the standard, relying on anonymized model outputs for fairness. In this work, we show that such anonymity can be easily broken. We find that generations from each T2I model form distinctive clusters in the image embedding space, enabling accurate deanonymization without prompt control or training data. Using 22 models and 280 prompts (150K images), our centroid-based method achieves high accuracy and reveals systematic model-specific signatures. We further introduce a prompt-level distinguishability metric and conduct large-scale analyses showing how certain prompts can lead to near-perfect distinguishability. Our findings expose fundamental security flaws in T2I leaderboards and motivate stronger anonymization defenses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for estimating simulation-ready garments from a single image without multi-view capture or iterative optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the absence of image-to-physics datasets and address the challenge of estimating garment material properties and physics directly from a single image, which is an ill-posed problem.

Method: The method involves fine-tuning a vision-language model for material and fabric attribute estimation, followed by training a predictor to map these attributes to physical fabric parameters using a small dataset. Additionally, two datasets, FTAG and T2P, are introduced.

Result: The framework achieves superior accuracy in material composition and fabric attribute estimation, leading to higher-fidelity garment simulations compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully delivers physically accurate, simulation-ready garments from a single image in a more efficient manner, advancing the state of the art.

Abstract: Estimating physically accurate, simulation-ready garments from a single image is challenging due to the absence of image-to-physics datasets and the ill-posed nature of this problem. Prior methods either require multi-view capture and expensive differentiable simulation or predict only garment geometry without the material properties required for realistic simulation. We propose a feed-forward framework that sidesteps these limitations by first fine-tuning a vision-language model to infer material composition and fabric attributes from real images, and then training a lightweight predictor that maps these attributes to the corresponding physical fabric parameters using a small dataset of material-physics measurements. Our approach introduces two new datasets (FTAG and T2P) and delivers simulation-ready garments from a single image without iterative optimization. Experiments show that our estimator achieves superior accuracy in material composition estimation and fabric attribute prediction, and by passing them through our physics parameter estimator, we further achieve higher-fidelity simulations compared to state-of-the-art image-to-garment methods.

TL;DR: LiteEmbed is a lightweight framework that optimizes text embeddings within CLIP for few-shot personalization, enhancing performance on rare or unseen classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations of large-scale vision-language models like CLIP, which struggle with rare, culturally specific, or newly emerging entities.

Method: LiteEmbed uses subspace-guided optimization and PCA decomposition of text embeddings, implementing coarse alignment and fine separation objectives for discriminability while preserving semantic consistency.

Result: Experiments show significant performance improvements across tasks like classification, retrieval, segmentation, and detection, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: LiteEmbed effectively adapts CLIP to rare, underrepresented, or novel classes through efficient optimization of text embeddings.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition but struggle with classes that are rarely seen during pretraining, including newly emerging entities and culturally specific categories. We introduce LiteEmbed, a lightweight framework for few-shot personalization of CLIP that enables new classes to be added without retraining its encoders. LiteEmbed performs subspace-guided optimization of text embeddings within CLIP's vocabulary, leveraging a PCA-based decomposition that disentangles coarse semantic directions from fine-grained variations. Two complementary objectives, coarse alignment and fine separation, jointly preserve global semantic consistency while enhancing discriminability among visually similar classes. Once optimized, the embeddings are plug-and-play, seamlessly substituting CLIP's original text features across classification, retrieval, segmentation, and detection tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial gains over prior methods, establishing LiteEmbed as an effective approach for adapting CLIP to underrepresented, rare, or unseen classes.

*Xuyang Fang,Sion Hannuna,Edwin Simpson,Neill Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study presents a self-supervised method for animal identification in long videos using clustering, achieving $>$97% accuracy without expensive computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation for animal identification in videos is labor-intensive, and existing computational methods struggle with efficiency, especially over long sequences.

Method: The method uses a frozen pre-trained backbone, frame pairing, and the Hungarian algorithm for pseudo-label assignment, coupled with Binary Cross Entropy loss, to learn discriminative features efficiently.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art accuracy surpassing supervised baselines on real-world datasets and reducing resource requirements to less than 1 GB of GPU memory.

Conclusion: The approach offers practical, high-accuracy animal identification using minimal hardware, addressing annotation bottlenecks for resource-constrained research.

Abstract: Identifying individual animals in long-duration videos is essential for behavioral ecology, wildlife monitoring, and livestock management. Traditional methods require extensive manual annotation, while existing self-supervised approaches are computationally demanding and ill-suited for long sequences due to memory constraints and temporal error propagation. We introduce a highly efficient, self-supervised method that reframes animal identification as a global clustering task rather than a sequential tracking problem. Our approach assumes a known, fixed number of individuals within a single video -- a common scenario in practice -- and requires only bounding box detections and the total count. By sampling pairs of frames, using a frozen pre-trained backbone, and employing a self-bootstrapping mechanism with the Hungarian algorithm for in-batch pseudo-label assignment, our method learns discriminative features without identity labels. We adapt a Binary Cross Entropy loss from vision-language models, enabling state-of-the-art accuracy ($>$97\%) while consuming less than 1 GB of GPU memory per batch -- an order of magnitude less than standard contrastive methods. Evaluated on challenging real-world datasets (3D-POP pigeons and 8-calves feeding videos), our framework matches or surpasses supervised baselines trained on over 1,000 labeled frames, effectively removing the manual annotation bottleneck. This work enables practical, high-accuracy animal identification on consumer-grade hardware, with broad applicability in resource-constrained research settings.

TL;DR: SCE-SLAM introduces a system to address scale drift in monocular visual SLAM using scene coordinate embeddings. It achieves improved trajectory accuracy and consistency while maintaining real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scale drift is a persistent challenge in monocular visual SLAM, particularly over long video sequences, limiting its application in real-world scenarios like autonomous navigation.

Method: The paper proposes SCE-SLAM, employing scene coordinate embeddings for maintaining scale consistency via geometry-guided aggregation and scene coordinate bundle adjustment.

Result: SCE-SLAM demonstrated improved trajectory accuracy, reducing absolute trajectory error by 8.36m on KITTI and confirmed scale consistency across large-scale environments at 36 FPS.

Conclusion: SCE-SLAM effectively addresses scale drift while maintaining efficiency, paving the way for more reliable monocular SLAM systems for real-time applications.

Abstract: Monocular visual SLAM enables 3D reconstruction from internet video and autonomous navigation on resource-constrained platforms, yet suffers from scale drift, i.e., the gradual divergence of estimated scale over long sequences. Existing frame-to-frame methods achieve real-time performance through local optimization but accumulate scale drift due to the lack of global constraints among independent windows. To address this, we propose SCE-SLAM, an end-to-end SLAM system that maintains scale consistency through scene coordinate embeddings, which are learned patch-level representations encoding 3D geometric relationships under a canonical scale reference. The framework consists of two key modules: geometry-guided aggregation that leverages 3D spatial proximity to propagate scale information from historical observations through geometry-modulated attention, and scene coordinate bundle adjustment that anchors current estimates to the reference scale through explicit 3D coordinate constraints decoded from the scene coordinate embeddings. Experiments on KITTI, Waymo, and vKITTI demonstrate substantial improvements: our method reduces absolute trajectory error by 8.36m on KITTI compared to the best prior approach, while maintaining 36 FPS and achieving scale consistency across large-scale scenes.

TL;DR: STEP3-VL-10B is a lightweight, efficient multimodal foundation model delivering top-tier performance while being significantly smaller than its competitors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the trade-off between model efficiency and multimodal intelligence, providing a compact, high-performing multimodal foundation model as an open-source resource.

Method: STEP3-VL-10B utilizes a unified pre-training strategy on 1.2T multimodal tokens, integrates a Perception Encoder with a Qwen3-8B decoder, and applies a reinforcement learning post-training pipeline. It also introduces the Parallel Coordinated Reasoning (PaCoRe) approach for scalable test-time compute.

Result: STEP3-VL-10B achieves superior performance compared to much larger models, with benchmark results such as 92.2% on MMBench, 80.11% on MMMU, 94.43% on AIME2025, and 75.95% on MathVision.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates that it is possible to achieve frontier-level multimodal intelligence in a compact 10B parameter model, providing a reproducible and efficient baseline for the research community.

Abstract: We present STEP3-VL-10B, a lightweight open-source foundation model designed to redefine the trade-off between compact efficiency and frontier-level multimodal intelligence. STEP3-VL-10B is realized through two strategic shifts: first, a unified, fully unfrozen pre-training strategy on 1.2T multimodal tokens that integrates a language-aligned Perception Encoder with a Qwen3-8B decoder to establish intrinsic vision-language synergy; and second, a scaled post-training pipeline featuring over 1k iterations of reinforcement learning. Crucially, we implement Parallel Coordinated Reasoning (PaCoRe) to scale test-time compute, allocating resources to scalable perceptual reasoning that explores and synthesizes diverse visual hypotheses. Consequently, despite its compact 10B footprint, STEP3-VL-10B rivals or surpasses models 10$\times$-20$\times$ larger (e.g., GLM-4.6V-106B, Qwen3-VL-235B) and top-tier proprietary flagships like Gemini 2.5 Pro and Seed-1.5-VL. Delivering best-in-class performance, it records 92.2% on MMBench and 80.11% on MMMU, while excelling in complex reasoning with 94.43% on AIME2025 and 75.95% on MathVision. We release the full model suite to provide the community with a powerful, efficient, and reproducible baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiency in video generation models preventing real-time applications in embodied AI, VR/AR.

Method: Uses sparse keyframe generation with diffusion models, followed by 3D reconstruction and adaptive keyframe prediction based on camera trajectory.

Result: SRENDER achieves video generation over 40 times faster than baseline diffusion models, maintaining visual fidelity and stability.

Conclusion: SRENDER provides a scalable and efficient method for video synthesis, enabling real-time uses in practical applications like AR/VR and embodied AI.

Abstract: Modern video generative models based on diffusion models can produce very realistic clips, but they are computationally inefficient, often requiring minutes of GPU time for just a few seconds of video. This inefficiency poses a critical barrier to deploying generative video in applications that require real-time interactions, such as embodied AI and VR/AR. This paper explores a new strategy for camera-conditioned video generation of static scenes: using diffusion-based generative models to generate a sparse set of keyframes, and then synthesizing the full video through 3D reconstruction and rendering. By lifting keyframes into a 3D representation and rendering intermediate views, our approach amortizes the generation cost across hundreds of frames while enforcing geometric consistency. We further introduce a model that predicts the optimal number of keyframes for a given camera trajectory, allowing the system to adaptively allocate computation. Our final method, SRENDER, uses very sparse keyframes for simple trajectories and denser ones for complex camera motion. This results in video generation that is more than 40 times faster than the diffusion-based baseline in generating 20 seconds of video, while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal stability, offering a practical path toward efficient and controllable video synthesis.

TL;DR: COMPOSE proposes a novel framework for 3D pose estimation, using hypergraph partitioning for multi-view correspondence matching, achieving significant improvements in key benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D pose estimation using sparse multi-views is often hampered by unreliable spurious associations in existing pipelines, which only utilize soft constraints for global consistency.

Method: The paper introduces 'COMPOSE,' a framework for pose matching based on hypergraph partitioning rather than pairwise associations. Efficiency is ensured using a geometric pruning strategy to reduce computational costs.

Result: COMPOSE demonstrates performance improvements of up to 23% in average precision versus other optimization-based methods and 11% over end-to-end self-supervised approaches.

Conclusion: The COMPOSE framework offers a robust and computationally efficient solution for achieving globally consistent 3D pose estimation, addressing key challenges of prior methods.

Abstract: 3D pose estimation from sparse multi-views is a critical task for numerous applications, including action recognition, sports analysis, and human-robot interaction. Optimization-based methods typically follow a two-stage pipeline, first detecting 2D keypoints in each view and then associating these detections across views to triangulate the 3D pose. Existing methods rely on mere pairwise associations to model this correspondence problem, treating global consistency between views (i.e., cycle consistency) as a soft constraint. Yet, reconciling these constraints for multiple views becomes brittle when spurious associations propagate errors. We thus propose COMPOSE, a novel framework that formulates multi-view pose correspondence matching as a hypergraph partitioning problem rather than through pairwise association. While the complexity of the resulting integer linear program grows exponentially in theory, we introduce an efficient geometric pruning strategy to substantially reduce the search space. COMPOSE achieves improvements of up to 23% in average precision over previous optimization-based methods and up to 11% over self-supervised end-to-end learned methods, offering a promising solution to a widely studied problem.

Motivation: The need to improve SAM3’s collective memory selection in complex multi-object scenarios, where synchronized decisions can overlook individual object reliability.

Method: Proposes SAM3-DMS, a training-free strategy focusing on fine-grained memory selection for individual objects instead of group-level synchronization.

Result: SAM3-DMS achieves improved identity preservation and tracking stability, especially in dense multi-object scenarios.

Conclusion: SAM3-DMS provides a strong framework for handling simultaneous multi-target video segmentation in diverse and real-world settings.

Abstract: Segment Anything 3 (SAM3) has established a powerful foundation that robustly detects, segments, and tracks specified targets in videos. However, in its original implementation, its group-level collective memory selection is suboptimal for complex multi-object scenarios, as it employs a synchronized decision across all concurrent targets conditioned on their average performance, often overlooking individual reliability. To this end, we propose SAM3-DMS, a training-free decoupled strategy that utilizes fine-grained memory selection on individual objects. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves robust identity preservation and tracking stability. Notably, our advantage becomes more pronounced with increased target density, establishing a solid foundation for simultaneous multi-target video segmentation in the wild.

*Yufan Xia,Marco De La Pierre,Amanda S. Barnard,Giuseppe Maria Junior Barca*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The study introduces a machine learning-based approach to optimize runtime performance in GEMM tasks by determining optimal thread count for multi-core systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of modern multi-core systems makes it challenging to determine the optimal thread number for minimising GEMM runtime.

Method: The proposed approach utilizes a machine learning model, trained on-the-fly, to select the optimal thread count for GEMM tasks based on collected data.

Result: Testing on Intel Cascade Lake and AMD Zen 3 systems demonstrated a 25–40% speedup compared to traditional BLAS GEMM implementations for tasks under 100 MB memory usage.

Conclusion: Machine learning can significantly optimize shared memory multi-core systems' performance in GEMM tasks, improving efficiency over traditional methods.

Abstract: The GEneral Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) is one of the essential algorithms in scientific computing. Single-thread GEMM implementations are well-optimised with techniques like blocking and autotuning. However, due to the complexity of modern multi-core shared memory systems, it is challenging to determine the number of threads that minimises the multi-thread GEMM runtime. We present a proof-of-concept approach to building an Architecture and Data-Structure Aware Linear Algebra (ADSALA) software library that uses machine learning to optimise the runtime performance of BLAS routines. More specifically, our method uses a machine learning model on-the-fly to automatically select the optimal number of threads for a given GEMM task based on the collected training data. Test results on two different HPC node architectures, one based on a two-socket Intel Cascade Lake and the other on a two-socket AMD Zen 3, revealed a 25 to 40 per cent speedup compared to traditional GEMM implementations in BLAS when using GEMM of memory usage within 100 MB.

### [182] [Optimizing View Change for Byzantine Fault Tolerance in Parallel Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09184)
*Yifei Xie,Btissam Er-Rahmadi,Xiao Chen,Tiejun Ma,Jane Hillston*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper addresses the view change inefficiencies in parallel Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols by proposing an optimization model for leader selection and reassignment to improve scalability, especially in permissioned blockchains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the consensus scalability issue in permissioned blockchains, particularly the performance bottleneck caused by inefficient view change mechanisms in parallel BFT protocols.

Method: The paper introduces a View Change Optimization (VCO) model utilizing mixed integer programming to optimize leader selection and follower reassignment. Additionally, it employs decomposition methods and iterative backup leader selection algorithms to tackle these challenges efficiently.

Result: Experiments conducted in Microsoft Azure show that the VCO-driven parallel BFT significantly outperforms traditional approaches in both normal and faulty operational conditions, especially as network size increases.

Conclusion: The VCO model is an effective and scalable solution for enhancing the performance of parallel BFT systems, addressing the limitations of existing leader rotation mechanisms.

Abstract: The parallel Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol is viewed as a promising solution to address the consensus scalability issue of the permissioned blockchain. One of the main challenges in parallel BFT is the view change process that happens when the leader node fails, which can lead to performance bottlenecks. Existing parallel BFT protocols typically rely on passive view change mechanisms with blind leader rotation. Such approaches frequently select unavailable or slow nodes as leaders, resulting in degraded performance. To address these challenges, we propose a View Change Optimization (VCO) model based on mixed integer programming that optimizes leader selection and follower reassignment across parallel committees by considering communication delays and failure scenarios. We applied a decomposition method with efficient subproblems and improved benders cuts to solve the VCO model. Leveraging the results of improved decomposition solution method, we propose an efficient iterative backup leader selection algorithm as views proceed. By performing experiments in Microsoft Azure cloud environments, we demonstrate that the VCO-driven parallel BFT outperforms existing configuration methods under both normal operation and faulty condition. The results show that the VCO model is effective as network size increases, making it a suitable solution for high-performance parallel BFT systems.

### [183] [LatencyPrism: Online Non-intrusive Latency Sculpting for SLO-Guaranteed LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09258)
*Du Yin,Jiayi Ren,Xiayu Sun,Tianyao Zhou,Haizhu Zhou,Ruiyan Ma,Danyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces LatencyPrism, a real-time latency analysis system for LLM inference environments, providing low-overhead monitoring and anomaly detection without intrusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM inference latency impacts user satisfaction and operational costs, with challenges arising from distributed environments and diverse architectures, making traditional analysis methods insufficient.

Method: LatencyPrism offers a non-intrusive, multi-platform latency analysis, breaking down inference latency across pipelines, detecting anomalies in real time, and adhering to SLOs without modifying code or restarting services.

Result: LatencyPrism demonstrates low-latency batch-level monitoring, anomaly alerting within milliseconds, and achieves an F1-score of 0.98 in distinguishing latency anomalies from workload variations.

Conclusion: The system effectively provides reliable real-time latency analysis and contributes to root cause identification for improving LLM inference in heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: LLM inference latency critically determines user experience and operational costs, directly impacting throughput under SLO constraints. Even brief latency spikes degrade service quality despite acceptable average performance. However, distributed inference environments featuring diverse software frameworks and XPU architectures combined with dynamic workloads make latency analysis challenging. Constrained by intrusive designs that necessitate service restarts or even suspension, and by hardware-bound implementations that fail to adapt to heterogeneous inference environments, existing AI profiling methods are often inadequate for real-time production analysis.
  We present LatencyPrism, the first zero-intrusion multi-platform latency sculpting system. It aims to break down the inference latency across pipeline, proactively alert on inference latency anomalies, and guarantee adherence to SLOs, all without requiring code modifications or service restarts. LatencyPrism has been deployed across thousands of XPUs for over six months. It enables low-overhead real-time monitoring at batch level with alerts triggered in milliseconds. This approach distinguishes between workload-driven latency variations and anomalies indicating underlying issues with an F1-score of 0.98. We also conduct extensive experiments and investigations into root cause analysis to demonstrate LatencyPrism's capability.

### [185] [Attention Consistency Regularization for Interpretable Early-Exit Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08891)
*Yanhua Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Explanation-Guided Training (EGT), which aligns early-exit neural networks' attention maps with the final prediction for better interpretability and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of interpretability and feature consistency in early-exit neural networks, which affects trust and explainability.

Method: The EGT framework integrates an attention consistency loss to align attention maps of intermediate exits with the final exit and uses a weighted combination of classification and attention consistency loss for training.

Result: The EGT framework matches the baseline accuracy (98.97%) with a 1.97x speedup in inference while improving attention consistency by 18.5%.

Conclusion: EGT enhances interpretability and consistency in early-exit networks, making them more suitable for explainable AI applications in constrained settings.

Abstract: Early-exit neural networks enable adaptive inference by allowing predictions at intermediate layers, reducing computational cost. However, early exits often lack interpretability and may focus on different features than deeper layers, limiting trust and explainability. This paper presents Explanation-Guided Training (EGT), a multi-objective framework that improves interpretability and consistency in early-exit networks through attention-based regularization. EGT introduces an attention consistency loss that aligns early-exit attention maps with the final exit. The framework jointly optimizes classification accuracy and attention consistency through a weighted combination of losses. Experiments on a real-world image classification dataset demonstrate that EGT achieves up to 98.97% overall accuracy (matching baseline performance) with a 1.97x inference speedup through early exits, while improving attention consistency by up to 18.5% compared to baseline models. The proposed method provides more interpretable and consistent explanations across all exit points, making early-exit networks more suitable for explainable AI applications in resource-constrained environments.

### [186] [Spectral Generative Flow Models: A Physics-Inspired Replacement for Vectorized Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08893)
*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spectral Generative Flow Models (SGFMs), an alternative to traditional transformer models using a physics-inspired approach grounded in continuous fields and stochastic dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a generative model addressing limitations of transformer-based language models by leveraging physical principles and providing coherent, multimodal generality.

Method: SGFMs replace attention mechanisms with local operators, spectral projections, and constrained stochastic dynamics in a multiscale wavelet basis to model text and video generation.

Result: The proposed framework introduces a unified representation for text and video, computational efficiency, and stability in generative modeling, deviating from autoregressive and diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: SGFMs present a novel architecture for generative modeling, focusing on physical structure and coherence, offering direction for advancing beyond traditional transformer-based and autoregressive approaches.

Abstract: We introduce Spectral Generative Flow Models (SGFMs), a physics-inspired alternative to transformer-based large language models. Instead of representing text or video as sequences of discrete tokens processed by attention, SGFMs treat generation as the evolution of a continuous field governed by constrained stochastic dynamics in a multiscale wavelet basis. This formulation replaces global attention with local operators, spectral projections, and Navier--Stokes-like transport, yielding a generative mechanism grounded in continuity, geometry, and physical structure.
  Our framework provides three key innovations: (i) a field-theoretic ontology in which text and video are unified as trajectories of a stochastic partial differential equation; (ii) a wavelet-domain representation that induces sparsity, scale separation, and computational efficiency; and (iii) a constrained stochastic flow that enforces stability, coherence, and uncertainty propagation. Together, these components define a generative architecture that departs fundamentally from autoregressive modeling and diffusion-based approaches. SGFMs offer a principled path toward long-range coherence, multimodal generality, and physically structured inductive bias in next-generation generative models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a machine learning framework using XGBoost to forecast daily log-returns in the NEPSE Index, achieving better performance than ARIMA and Ridge regression benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in forecasting financial time series for volatile emerging markets like the NEPSE, aiming for improved prediction accuracy and directional forecasting.

Method: The authors used XGBoost with engineered features such as lagged log-returns, technical indicators, and optimized hyperparameters via Optuna with walk-forward validation and rolling schemes.

Result: The approach outperformed ARIMA and Ridge regression with the optimal configuration yielding RMSE of 0.013450, MAE of 0.009814, and directional accuracy of 65.15%. Feature importance analysis added interpretability.

Conclusion: XGBoost proves effective for capturing nonlinear dynamics in emerging market time series, offering a reproducible benchmark for NEPSE Index forecasting.

Abstract: This study develops a robust machine learning framework for one-step-ahead forecasting of daily log-returns in the Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) Index using the XGBoost regressor. A comprehensive feature set is engineered, including lagged log-returns (up to 30 days) and established technical indicators such as short- and medium-term rolling volatility measures and the 14-period Relative Strength Index. Hyperparameter optimization is performed using Optuna with time-series cross-validation on the initial training segment. Out-of-sample performance is rigorously assessed via walk-forward validation under both expanding and fixed-length rolling window schemes across multiple lag configurations, simulating real-world deployment and avoiding lookahead bias. Predictive accuracy is evaluated using root mean squared error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination (R-squared), and directional accuracy on both log-returns and reconstructed closing prices. Empirical results show that the optimal configuration, an expanding window with 20 lags, outperforms tuned ARIMA and Ridge regression benchmarks, achieving the lowest log-return RMSE (0.013450) and MAE (0.009814) alongside a directional accuracy of 65.15%. While the R-squared remains modest, consistent with the noisy nature of financial returns, primary emphasis is placed on relative error reduction and directional prediction. Feature importance analysis and visual inspection further enhance interpretability. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of gradient boosting ensembles in modeling nonlinear dynamics in volatile emerging market time series and establish a reproducible benchmark for NEPSE Index forecasting.

### [188] [Private LLM Inference on Consumer Blackwell GPUs: A Practical Guide for Cost-Effective Local Deployment in SMEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09527)
*Jonathan Knoop,Hendrik Holtmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates NVIDIA's Blackwell consumer GPUs for local Large Language Model (LLM) inference by testing four open-weight models across various quantization formats, context lengths, and workloads, finding them cost-effective for SMEs compared to cloud inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud LLM API solutions raise data privacy and cost concerns for SMEs, while professional on-premise hardware is too costly. This work seeks an affordable and privacy-preserving alternative for deploying LLM inference.

Method: The authors benchmark NVIDIA's Blackwell GPUs using four LLMs and analyze their performance on multiple quantization formats, workloads, and configurations to assess efficiency, costs, energy consumption, and latency.

Result: RTX 5090 achieved the best overall throughput and latency, while budget GPUs provided the most cost-effective solutions for many SME API workloads. NVFP4 quantization outperformed BF16 in energy use and throughput with minimal quality loss. Overall, self-hosted setups were up to 200x cheaper than cloud APIs.

Conclusion: Consumer GPUs are viable alternatives to cloud-based LLM inference solutions for SMEs, offering significant cost reductions and privacy advantages except for highly latency-sensitive applications requiring professional-grade hardware.

Abstract: SMEs increasingly seek alternatives to cloud LLM APIs, which raise data privacy concerns. Dedicated cloud GPU instances offer improved privacy but with limited guarantees and ongoing costs, while professional on-premise hardware (A100, H100) remains prohibitively expensive. We present a systematic evaluation of NVIDIA's Blackwell consumer GPUs (RTX 5060 Ti, 5070 Ti, 5090) for production LLM inference, benchmarking four open-weight models (Qwen3-8B, Gemma3-12B, Gemma3-27B, GPT-OSS-20B) across 79 configurations spanning quantization formats (BF16, W4A16, NVFP4, MXFP4), context lengths (8k-64k), and three workloads: RAG, multi-LoRA agentic serving, and high-concurrency APIs. The RTX 5090 delivers 3.5-4.6x higher throughput than the 5060 Ti with 21x lower latency for RAG, but budget GPUs achieve the highest throughput-per-dollar for API workloads with sub-second latency. NVFP4 quantization provides 1.6x throughput over BF16 with 41% energy reduction and only 2-4% quality loss. Self-hosted inference costs $0.001-0.04 per million tokens (electricity only), which is 40-200x cheaper than budget-tier cloud APIs, with hardware breaking even in under four months at moderate volume (30M tokens/day). Our results show that consumer GPUs can reliably replace cloud inference for most SME workloads, except latency-critical long-context RAG, where high-end GPUs remain essential. We provide deployment guidance and release all benchmark data for reproducible SME-scale deployments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve unbounded metric movement costs in bandit online convex optimization, particularly in dynamic environments with high-dimensional costs and noisy feedback.

Method: The SCaLE algorithm is designed with a novel spectral regret analysis, quantifying eigenvalue-error and eigenbasis-perturbation contributions to regret.

Result: The algorithm achieves distribution-agnostic sub-linear dynamic regret without prior knowledge of hitting cost structures and shows superior statistical consistency in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: SCaLE advances dynamic online convex optimization under noisy, stochastic environments, proving distribution-agnostic effectiveness and outperforming baselines.

Abstract: This work addresses the fundamental problem of unbounded metric movement costs in bandit online convex optimization, by considering high-dimensional dynamic quadratic hitting costs and $\ell_2$-norm switching costs in a noisy bandit feedback model. For a general class of stochastic environments, we provide the first algorithm SCaLE that provably achieves a distribution-agnostic sub-linear dynamic regret, without the knowledge of hitting cost structure. En-route, we present a novel spectral regret analysis that separately quantifies eigenvalue-error driven regret and eigenbasis-perturbation driven regret. Extensive numerical experiments, against online-learning baselines, corroborate our claims, and highlight statistical consistency of our algorithm.

### [190] [DriftGuard: A Hierarchical Framework for Concept Drift Detection and Remediation in Supply Chain Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08928)
*Shahnawaz Alam,Mohammed Abdul Rahman,Bareera Sadeqa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DriftGuard introduces a five-module system to detect, diagnose, and address concept drift in supply chain forecasting, improving detection speed and cost-efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current drift detection approaches in supply chains, which are manual, resource-wasting, and ineffective against rapid drift.

Method: Proposed a five-module framework combining four detection methods, hierarchical propagation analysis for localization, SHAP for diagnosis, and cost-efficient retraining strategies.

Result: The system achieved 97.8% detection recall within 4.2 days and demonstrated up to 417 return on investment when tested on 30,000 time series.

Conclusion: DriftGuard effectively mitigates concept drift in supply chains by providing an automated, accurate, and resource-efficient solution for drift detection and correction.

Abstract: Supply chain forecasting models degrade over time as real-world conditions change. Promotions shift, consumer preferences evolve, and supply disruptions alter demand patterns, causing what is known as concept drift. This silent degradation leads to stockouts or excess inventory without triggering any system warnings. Current industry practice relies on manual monitoring and scheduled retraining every 3-6 months, which wastes computational resources during stable periods while missing rapid drift events. Existing academic methods focus narrowly on drift detection without addressing diagnosis or remediation, and they ignore the hierarchical structure inherent in supply chain data. What retailers need is an end-to-end system that detects drift early, explains its root causes, and automatically corrects affected models. We propose DriftGuard, a five-module framework that addresses the complete drift lifecycle. The system combines an ensemble of four complementary detection methods, namely error-based monitoring, statistical tests, autoencoder anomaly detection, and Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) change-point analysis, with hierarchical propagation analysis to identify exactly where drift occurs across product lines. Once detected, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis diagnoses the root causes, and a cost-aware retraining strategy selectively updates only the most affected models. Evaluated on over 30,000 time series from the M5 retail dataset, DriftGuard achieves 97.8% detection recall within 4.2 days and delivers up to 417 return on investment through targeted remediation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes computationally efficient algorithms for Bandit Clustering (BC) under a fixed confidence setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of clustering arms with vector-parametric distributions, which generalizes beyond the assumption of Gaussian distributions, while reducing computational inefficiency in existing BC algorithms.

Method: The authors introduce the Efficient Bandit Clustering (EBC) algorithm, which optimizes arm selection incrementally rather than solving a full optimization problem, and EBC-H, a simplified heuristic variant.

Result: The EBC and EBC-H algorithms demonstrated superior computational efficiency and competitive performance compared to existing BC approaches through simulations on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: EBC and EBC-H achieve asymptotic optimality and computational efficiency, broadening the applicability of BC algorithms to a wider range of distributions.

Abstract: We study the Bandit Clustering (BC) problem under the fixed confidence setting, where the objective is to group a collection of data sequences (arms) into clusters through sequential sampling from adaptively selected arms at each time step while ensuring a fixed error probability at the stopping time. We consider a setting where arms in a cluster may have different distributions. Unlike existing results in this setting, which assume Gaussian-distributed arms, we study a broader class of vector-parametric distributions that satisfy mild regularity conditions. Existing asymptotically optimal BC algorithms require solving an optimization problem as part of their sampling rule at each step, which is computationally costly. We propose an Efficient Bandit Clustering algorithm (EBC), which, instead of solving the full optimization problem, takes a single step toward the optimal value at each time step, making it computationally efficient while remaining asymptotically optimal. We also propose a heuristic variant of EBC, called EBC-H, which further simplifies the sampling rule, with arm selection based on quantities computed as part of the stopping rule. We highlight the computational efficiency of EBC and EBC-H by comparing their per-sample run time with that of existing algorithms. The asymptotic optimality of EBC is supported through simulations on the synthetic datasets. Through simulations on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we show the performance gain of EBC and EBC-H over existing approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses inefficiencies in molecular diffusion models by framing Directly Denoising Diffusion Model (DDDM) through the Reverse Transition Kernel (RTK) framework, improving inference time and structural fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inefficiencies in current diffusion models for molecular generation, such as long sampling times, stochastic variance, and limited structural awareness.

Method: The authors reinterpret DDDM using the RTK framework, demonstrating that deterministic denoising optimizes structured transport maps for noise-to-clean transitions, ensuring stability, consistency, and scalability.

Result: The approach achieves faster convergence, higher molecular structural fidelity, and eliminates stochastic variance, validated over GEOM-DRUGS dataset.

Conclusion: RTK-guided deterministic denoising offers a unified framework enhancing diffusion model efficiency and scalability, preserving SE(3) symmetry, and improving chemical validity.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models for molecular design, capable of capturing complex structural distributions and achieving high fidelity in 3D molecule generation. However, their widespread use remains constrained by long sampling trajectories, stochastic variance in the reverse process, and limited structural awareness in denoising dynamics. The Directly Denoising Diffusion Model (DDDM) mitigates these inefficiencies by replacing stochastic reverse MCMC updates with deterministic denoising step, substantially reducing inference time. Yet, the theoretical underpinnings of such deterministic updates have remained opaque. In this work, we provide a principled reinterpretation of DDDM through the lens of the Reverse Transition Kernel (RTK) framework by Huang et al. 2024, unifying deterministic and stochastic diffusion under a shared probabilistic formalism. By expressing the DDDM reverse process as an approximate kernel operator, we show that the direct denoising process implicitly optimizes a structured transport map between noisy and clean samples. This perspective elucidates why deterministic denoising achieves efficient inference. Beyond theoretical clarity, this reframing resolves several long-standing bottlenecks in molecular diffusion. The RTK view ensures numerical stability by enforcing well-conditioned reverse kernels, improves sample consistency by eliminating stochastic variance, and enables scalable and symmetry-preserving denoisers that respect SE(3) equivariance. Empirically, we demonstrate that RTK-guided deterministic denoising achieves faster convergence and higher structural fidelity than stochastic diffusion models, while preserving chemical validity across GEOM-DRUGS dataset. Code, models, and datasets are publicly available in our project repository.

### [193] [Geometric Stability: The Missing Axis of Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09173)
*Prashant C. Raju*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the concept of geometric stability, which measures the reliability of representational geometry under perturbations, distinct from similarity metrics. It presents Shesha, a framework for this analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation in representation analysis, which traditionally emphasizes similarity but neglects robustness of structure under perturbations.

Method: The authors develop 'Shesha,' a framework that measures geometric stability across representations in various domains and compares it against similarity metrics.

Result: The research finds geometric stability to be empirically uncorrelated to similarity (ρ ≈ 0.01) and superior for tasks like safety monitoring, controllability prediction, and model selection.

Conclusion: Geometric stability is a crucial metric for evaluating representational reliability, complementing similarity in both biological and computational systems.

Abstract: Analysis of learned representations has a blind spot: it focuses on $similarity$, measuring how closely embeddings align with external references, but similarity reveals only what is represented, not whether that structure is robust. We introduce $geometric$ $stability$, a distinct dimension that quantifies how reliably representational geometry holds under perturbation, and present $Shesha$, a framework for measuring it. Across 2,463 configurations in seven domains, we show that stability and similarity are empirically uncorrelated ($ρ\approx 0.01$) and mechanistically distinct: similarity metrics collapse after removing the top principal components, while stability retains sensitivity to fine-grained manifold structure. This distinction yields actionable insights: for safety monitoring, stability acts as a functional geometric canary, detecting structural drift nearly 2$\times$ more sensitively than CKA while filtering out the non-functional noise that triggers false alarms in rigid distance metrics; for controllability, supervised stability predicts linear steerability ($ρ= 0.89$-$0.96$); for model selection, stability dissociates from transferability, revealing a geometric tax that transfer optimization incurs. Beyond machine learning, stability predicts CRISPR perturbation coherence and neural-behavioral coupling. By quantifying $how$ $reliably$ systems maintain structure, geometric stability provides a necessary complement to similarity for auditing representations across biological and computational systems.

*Subhodeep Ghosh,Zhihui Du,Angela Bonifati,Manish Kumar,David Bader,Senjuti Basu Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fairness model for ensuring group fairness in data stream windows at a finer (block) granularity, coupled with efficient monitoring and reordering mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current group fairness methods for data streams are insufficient for large window sizes, necessitating a finer-granularity approach to maintain fairness effectively.

Method: Proposes a novel framework with sketch-based data structures for real-time monitoring and efficient algorithms for stream reordering with theoretical guarantees.

Result: Achieved high processing speeds, processing approximately 30,000 queries per second, and improved block-level fairness by up to 95% in some scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed model and algorithms are effective at enforcing continuous group fairness, particularly at block levels, offering significant improvements in fairness and efficiency for streaming scenarios.

Abstract: We study the problem of enforcing continuous group fairness over windows in data streams. We propose a novel fairness model that ensures group fairness at a finer granularity level (referred to as block) within each sliding window. This formulation is particularly useful when the window size is large, making it desirable to enforce fairness at a finer granularity. Within this framework, we address two key challenges: efficiently monitoring whether each sliding window satisfies block-level group fairness, and reordering the current window as effectively as possible when fairness is violated. To enable real-time monitoring, we design sketch-based data structures that maintain attribute distributions with minimal overhead. We also develop optimal, efficient algorithms for the reordering task, supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees. Our evaluation on four real-world streaming scenarios demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach. We achieve millisecond-level processing and a throughput of approximately 30,000 queries per second on average, depending on system parameters. The stream reordering algorithm improves block-level group fairness by up to 95% in certain cases, and by 50-60% on average across datasets. A qualitative study further highlights the advantages of block-level fairness compared to window-level fairness.

*Fiona Murphy,Alessio Benavoli*

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance causal discovery in time-series data by addressing nonlinear relationships and contemporaneous causality, leveraging existing frameworks and introducing new methods.

Method: The research unifies two kernel-based Granger Causality approaches under Kernel Principal Component Regression (KPCR), introduces the $GP_{SIC}$ model with score-based penalisation, and develops a contemporaneous causal identification algorithm.

Result: The unified KPCR-based method improves nonlinear causal identification. The $GP_{SIC}$ model demonstrates superior performance compared to existing causal discovery methods for both nonlinear and contemporaneous relationships.

Conclusion: The paper provides theoretical unification for kernel-based GC methods, demonstrates the efficacy of the $GP_{SIC}$ model, and underscores its applicability for advanced causal discovery tasks.

Abstract: Kernel-based methods are used in the context of Granger Causality to enable the identification of nonlinear causal relationships between time series variables. In this paper, we show that two state of the art kernel-based Granger Causality (GC) approaches can be theoretically unified under the framework of Kernel Principal Component Regression (KPCR), and introduce a method based on this unification, demonstrating that this approach can improve causal identification. Additionally, we introduce a Gaussian Process score-based model with Smooth Information Criterion penalisation on the marginal likelihood, and demonstrate improved performance over existing state of the art time-series nonlinear causal discovery methods. Furthermore, we propose a contemporaneous causal identification algorithm, fully based on GC, using the proposed score-based $GP_{SIC}$ method, and compare its performance to a state of the art contemporaneous time series causal discovery algorithm.

### [196] [Optimising for Energy Efficiency and Performance in Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08991)
*Emile Dos Santos Ferreira,Neil D. Lawrence,Andrei Paleyes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ECOpt, a tool that optimizes ML models for both energy efficiency and performance, highlighting the need for actionable energy metrics and discovering energy-efficient models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the growing energy consumption and environmental impact of ML, focusing on the often-overlooked inference cost while providing actionable tools for energy efficiency.

Method: The authors developed Energy Consumption Optimiser (ECOpt), a hyperparameter tuning tool creating a Pareto frontier to quantify trade-offs between energy consumption and model performance.

Result: Key results show that traditional proxies for energy (e.g., parameter counts) are unreliable, Transformer efficiency is hardware-consistent, and ECOpt identifies highly efficient models for CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: This work emphasizes the importance of measuring and publishing energy consumption of ML models and reveals ECOpt's potential for simultaneous environmental benefits and state-of-the-art model performance.

Abstract: The ubiquity of machine learning (ML) and the demand for ever-larger models bring an increase in energy consumption and environmental impact. However, little is known about the energy scaling laws in ML, and existing research focuses on training cost -- ignoring the larger cost of inference. Furthermore, tools for measuring the energy consumption of ML do not provide actionable feedback.
  To address these gaps, we developed Energy Consumption Optimiser (ECOpt): a hyperparameter tuner that optimises for energy efficiency and model performance. ECOpt quantifies the trade-off between these metrics as an interpretable Pareto frontier. This enables ML practitioners to make informed decisions about energy cost and environmental impact, while maximising the benefit of their models and complying with new regulations.
  Using ECOpt, we show that parameter and floating-point operation counts can be unreliable proxies for energy consumption, and observe that the energy efficiency of Transformer models for text generation is relatively consistent across hardware. These findings motivate measuring and publishing the energy metrics of ML models. We further show that ECOpt can have a net positive environmental impact and use it to uncover seven models for CIFAR-10 that improve upon the state of the art, when considering accuracy and energy efficiency together.

*Pranjal Patil,Anli Ji,Berkay Aydin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Physics-Guided Counterfactual Explanation framework for time series classification tasks, particularly useful in solar energetic particle forecasting, emphasizing physical plausibility and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of improving model interpretability in machine learning for solar energetic particle forecasting while ensuring that the generated counterfactual explanations are physically plausible.

Method: A Physics-Guided Counterfactual Explanation framework is developed, leveraging physical principles to enforce plausibility in counterfactuals, targeting multivariate time series classification tasks.

Result: The framework achieves significant improvements, including over 80% reduction in DTW distance, higher sparsity in explanations, a near 50% reduction in runtime compared to DiCE, and ensures physical plausibility.

Conclusion: The proposed framework not only improves numerical performance but also ensures the physical realism of counterfactual explanations, contributing to scalable and actionable scientific insights in big data environments.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of solar energetic particle events is vital for safeguarding satellites, astronauts, and space-based infrastructure. Modern space weather monitoring generates massive volumes of high-frequency, multivariate time series (MVTS) data from sources such as the Geostationary perational Environmental Satellites (GOES). Machine learning (ML) models trained on this data show strong predictive power, but most existing methods overlook domain-specific feasibility constraints. Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a key tool for improving model interpretability, yet existing approaches rarely enforce physical plausibility. This work introduces a Physics-Guided Counterfactual Explanation framework, a novel method for generating counterfactual explanations in time series classification tasks that remain consistent with underlying physical principles. Applied to solar energetic particles (SEP) forecasting, this framework achieves over 80% reduction in Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance increasing the proximity, produces counterfactual explanations with higher sparsity, and reduces runtime by nearly 50% compared to state-of-the-art baselines such as DiCE. Beyond numerical improvements, this framework ensures that generated counterfactual explanations are physically plausible and actionable in scientific domains. In summary, the framework generates counterfactual explanations that are both valid and physically consistent, while laying the foundation for scalable counterfactual generation in big data environments.

*Zhoubin Kou,Zihan Chen,Jing Yang,Cong Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HERON-SFL is a hybrid optimization framework for Split Federated Learning that uses zeroth-order optimization to reduce client resources while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of high memory, computation costs, and communication overhead in Split Federated Learning (SFL), particularly on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: HERON-SFL combines zeroth-order optimization (ZO) for client training and first-order optimization (FO) for server training. It uses auxiliary networks to compute approximations via perturbed forward-only evaluations, eliminating memory-intensive processes like activation caching and explicit gradient computation.

Result: HERON-SFL reduces client memory usage by up to 64% and client compute costs by up to 33% per step while achieving accuracy comparable to benchmarks on tasks like ResNet training and language model fine-tuning.

Conclusion: HERON-SFL makes SFL more scalable and efficient, allowing resource-constrained devices to train larger and more complex models effectively.

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) enables collaborative training between resource-constrained edge devices and a compute-rich server. Communication overhead is a central issue in SFL and can be mitigated with auxiliary networks. Yet, the fundamental client-side computation challenge remains, as back-propagation requires substantial memory and computation costs, severely limiting the scale of models that edge devices can support. To enable more resource-efficient client computation and reduce the client-server communication, we propose HERON-SFL, a novel hybrid optimization framework that integrates zeroth-order (ZO) optimization for local client training while retaining first-order (FO) optimization on the server. With the assistance of auxiliary networks, ZO updates enable clients to approximate local gradients using perturbed forward-only evaluations per step, eliminating memory-intensive activation caching and avoiding explicit gradient computation in the traditional training process. Leveraging the low effective rank assumption, we theoretically prove that HERON-SFL's convergence rate is independent of model dimensionality, addressing a key scalability concern common to ZO algorithms. Empirically, on ResNet training and language model (LM) fine-tuning tasks, HERON-SFL matches benchmark accuracy while reducing client peak memory by up to 64% and client-side compute cost by up to 33% per step, substantially expanding the range of models that can be trained or adapted on resource-limited devices.

*Lisa Schneckenreiter,Sohvi Luukkonen,Lukas Friedrich,Daniel Kuhn,Günter Klambauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ConGLUDe unifies structure- and ligand-based drug design with a contrastive geometric model, enabling state-of-the-art virtual screening and target fishing without pre-defined pocket information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of disjoint data sources and modeling assumptions in traditional structure- and ligand-based drug design approaches, enabling their seamless integration at scale.

Method: A contrastive geometric model called ConGLUDe was developed, featuring a geometric protein encoder for whole-protein representations and a ligand encoder. Using contrastive learning, it aligns ligands with proteins globally and locally for training on protein-ligand complexes and bioactivity data.

Result: ConGLUDe exhibited state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot virtual screening without relying on pre-defined pockets, surpassed other methods in target fishing, and performed competitively in ligand-conditioned pocket prediction.

Conclusion: Unified structure-ligand training with ConGLUDe offers significant benefits for drug discovery, positioning it as a step towards general-purpose foundation models in the field.

Abstract: Structure-based and ligand-based computational drug design have traditionally relied on disjoint data sources and modeling assumptions, limiting their joint use at scale. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Geometric Learning for Unified Computational Drug Design (ConGLUDe), a single contrastive geometric model that unifies structure- and ligand-based training. ConGLUDe couples a geometric protein encoder that produces whole-protein representations and implicit embeddings of predicted binding sites with a fast ligand encoder, removing the need for pre-defined pockets. By aligning ligands with both global protein representations and multiple candidate binding sites through contrastive learning, ConGLUDe supports ligand-conditioned pocket prediction in addition to virtual screening and target fishing, while being trained jointly on protein-ligand complexes and large-scale bioactivity data. Across diverse benchmarks, ConGLUDe achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot virtual screening performance in settings where no binding pocket information is provided as input, substantially outperforms existing methods on a challenging target fishing task, and demonstrates competitive ligand-conditioned pocket selection. These results highlight the advantages of unified structure-ligand training and position ConGLUDe as a step toward general-purpose foundation models for drug discovery.

*Annalisa Belloni,Lorenzo Noci,Antonio Orvieto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the Warmup Stable Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler’s unique efficiency in training large models and its broader implications for optimization landscapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the reasons behind the exceptional performance of the WSD learning rate scheduler and its potential to provide theoretical insights into the training dynamics of large models, particularly in nonconvex optimization landscapes.

Method: The authors compare the optimizer path, training signals, and sharpness dynamics of the WSD scheduler in training a Pythia-like language model and a small CNN on CIFAR-10 to identify shared patterns.

Result: They find that the training dynamics and optimizer behavior are largely consistent across different architectures, hinting at shared geometric properties of optimization landscapes across tasks.

Conclusion: The study suggests that the WSD scheduler’s effectiveness is not exclusive to transformers but rather highlights shared geometric features of nonconvex problems, with potential implications for understanding high-dimensional optimization.

Abstract: The Warmup Stable Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler has recently become popular, largely due to its good performance and flexibility when training large language models. It remains an open question whether the remarkable performance of WSD - using a decaying learning rate for only a fraction of training compared to cosine decay - is a phenomenon specific to transformer-based language models that can potentially offer new theoretical insights into their training dynamics. Inspired by the usage of learning rate schedulers as a new lens into understanding landscape geometry (e.g., river valley, connected minima, progressive sharpening), in this work we compare the WSD path of the Adam optimizer on a Pythia-like language model to that of a small CNN trained to classify CIFAR10 images. We observe most training signals, optimizer path features, and sharpness dynamics to be qualitatively similar in such architectures. This consistency points to shared geometric characteristics of the loss landscapes of old and new nonconvex problems, and hints to future research questions around the geometry of high dimensional optimization problems.

### [201] [DP-FEDSOFIM: Differentially Private Federated Stochastic Optimization using Regularized Fisher Information Matrix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09166)
*Sidhant R. Nair,Tanmay Sen,Mrinmay Sen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-FedSOFIM improves differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) by using a server-side second-order optimization approach that requires less memory and achieves better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP-FL faces challenges of slow convergence due to noise added for privacy preservation, especially under tight privacy budgets. Existing second-order methods have high memory requirements, making them impractical for large models.

Method: DP-FedSOFIM uses a server-side second-order optimization framework with the Fisher Information Matrix as a preconditioner. It applies the Sherman-Morrison formula to reduce memory and computational complexity to O(d) per client.

Result: Experimental results on CIFAR-10 show superior test accuracy of DP-FedSOFIM over first-order baseline methods across various privacy settings.

Conclusion: DP-FedSOFIM offers a practical and efficient solution for DP-FL by overcoming memory bottlenecks and maintaining strong privacy guarantees with enhanced convergence performance.

Abstract: Differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) suffers from slow convergence under tight privacy budgets due to the overwhelming noise introduced to preserve privacy. While adaptive optimizers can accelerate convergence, existing second-order methods such as DP-FedNew require O(d^2) memory at each client to maintain local feature covariance matrices, making them impractical for high-dimensional models. We propose DP-FedSOFIM, a server-side second-order optimization framework that leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) as a natural gradient preconditioner while requiring only O(d) memory per client. By employing the Sherman-Morrison formula for efficient matrix inversion, DP-FedSOFIM achieves O(d) computational complexity per round while maintaining the convergence benefits of second-order methods. Our analysis proves that the server-side preconditioning preserves (epsilon, delta)-differential privacy through the post-processing theorem. Empirical evaluation on CIFAR-10 demonstrates that DP-FedSOFIM achieves superior test accuracy compared to first-order baselines across multiple privacy regimes.

### [202] [Meta-learning to Address Data Shift in Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09018)
*Samuel Myren,Nidhi Parikh,Natalie Klein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper systematically evaluates meta-learning compared to traditional deep learning (TDL) models in handling data shift for time-series tasks, introducing a seismic benchmark (SeisTask) to analyze adaptation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of data shift in real-world scenarios where TDL models face performance degradation, emphasizing the potential of meta-learning to adapt more efficiently and robustly.

Method: The authors compare TDL models with fine-tuning and optimization-based meta-learning algorithms using the SeisTask benchmark focused on time-series classification under varying data conditions.

Result: Meta-learning demonstrates faster and more stable adaptation under data-scarce conditions, with reduced overfitting and smaller architectures. However, its benefits diminish with increased data and model capacity, where TDL with fine-tuning performs similarly.

Conclusion: Meta-learning is shown to outperform TDL under specific scenarios of data shift and scarcity, while alignment between training and test data distributions drives its performance gains. SeisTask contributes as a valuable benchmark for advancing adaptive learning in time-series domains.

Abstract: Across engineering and scientific domains, traditional deep learning (TDL) models perform well when training and test data share the same distribution. However, the dynamic nature of real-world data, broadly termed \textit{data shift}, renders TDL models prone to rapid performance degradation, requiring costly relabeling and inefficient retraining. Meta-learning, which enables models to adapt quickly to new data with few examples, offers a promising alternative for mitigating these challenges. Here, we systematically compare TDL with fine-tuning and optimization-based meta-learning algorithms to assess their ability to address data shift in time-series classification. We introduce a controlled, task-oriented seismic benchmark (SeisTask) and show that meta-learning typically achieves faster and more stable adaptation with reduced overfitting in data-scarce regimes and smaller model architectures. As data availability and model capacity increase, its advantages diminish, with TDL with fine-tuning performing comparably. Finally, we examine how task diversity influences meta-learning and find that alignment between training and test distributions, rather than diversity alone, drives performance gains. Overall, this work provides a systematic evaluation of when and why meta-learning outperforms TDL under data shift and contributes SeisTask as a benchmark for advancing adaptive learning research in time-series domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multilevel, layer-parallel training method for transformers utilizing neural ODEs to improve scalability and parallelism, addressing convergence issues with a novel algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited parallel scalability of transformers, particularly as their depth increases in large foundational models.

Method: The paper employs a neural ODE framework and multilevel parallel-in-time algorithms, with a novel technique to detect and mitigate gradient errors during critical transitions in training.

Result: Evaluation on BERT, GPT2, ViT, and machine translation systems shows significant parallel training acceleration while maintaining accuracy on par with serial training. Fine-tuning is unaffected.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully combines enhanced parallel scalability with maintained training accuracy, providing a potential solution for training increasingly deep transformer models.

Abstract: We present a new training methodology for transformers using a multilevel, layer-parallel approach. Through a neural ODE formulation of transformers, our application of a multilevel parallel-in-time algorithm for the forward and backpropagation phases of training achieves parallel acceleration over the layer dimension. This dramatically enhances parallel scalability as the network depth increases, which is particularly useful for increasingly large foundational models. However, achieving this introduces errors that cause systematic bias in the gradients, which in turn reduces convergence when closer to the minima. We develop an algorithm to detect this critical transition and either switch to serial training or systematically increase the accuracy of layer-parallel training. Results, including BERT, GPT2, ViT, and machine translation architectures, demonstrate parallel-acceleration as well as accuracy commensurate with serial pre-training while fine-tuning is unaffected.

TL;DR: This paper proposes DIMVC-HIA, a deep framework for incomplete multi-view clustering, to handle missing data while ensuring cluster compactness and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of accurately imputing missing views without introducing bias, and maintaining semantic consistency across views and compact cluster structures in partial multi-view observations.

Method: Introduces the DIMVC-HIA framework with four main components: latent feature extraction, hierarchical imputation module, energy-based semantic alignment, and contrastive assignment alignment.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets reveal that the proposed framework shows superior clustering performance even under varying degrees of missing data.

Conclusion: DIMVC-HIA effectively tackles incomplete multi-view clustering challenges by balancing imputation accuracy, cross-view consistency, and cluster compactness.

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) aims to discover shared cluster structures from multi-view data with partial observations. The core challenges lie in accurately imputing missing views without introducing bias, while maintaining semantic consistency across views and compactness within clusters. To address these challenges, we propose DIMVC-HIA, a novel deep IMVC framework that integrates hierarchical imputation and alignment with four key components: (1) view-specific autoencoders for latent feature extraction, coupled with a view-shared clustering predictor to produce soft cluster assignments; (2) a hierarchical imputation module that first estimates missing cluster assignments based on cross-view contrastive similarity, and then reconstructs missing features using intra-view, intra-cluster statistics; (3) an energy-based semantic alignment module, which promotes intra-cluster compactness by minimizing energy variance around low-energy cluster anchors; and (4) a contrastive assignment alignment module, which enhances cross-view consistency and encourages confident, well-separated cluster predictions. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance under varying levels of missingness.

*Parian Haghighat,Hadis Anahideh,Cynthia Rudin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses predictive multiplicity, proposing three approaches to reconcile inconsistent predictions among equally accurate models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of inconsistent predictions made by equally accurate models in high-stakes applications.

Method: The paper proposes three approaches: outlier correction, local patching, and pairwise reconciliation to reduce predictive multiplicity and inconsistency.

Result: Experiments show that these methods reduce disagreement metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy across datasets.

Conclusion: The approaches successfully reduce prediction inconsistency and can aid in producing a single interpretable model for deployment.

Abstract: The existence of multiple, equally accurate models for a given predictive task leads to predictive multiplicity, where a ``Rashomon set'' of models achieve similar accuracy but diverges in their individual predictions. This inconsistency undermines trust in high-stakes applications where we want consistent predictions. We propose three approaches to reduce inconsistency among predictions for the members of the Rashomon set. The first approach is \textbf{outlier correction}. An outlier has a label that none of the good models are capable of predicting correctly. Outliers can cause the Rashomon set to have high variance predictions in a local area, so fixing them can lower variance. Our second approach is local patching. In a local region around a test point, models may disagree with each other because some of them are biased. We can detect and fix such biases using a validation set, which also reduces multiplicity. Our third approach is pairwise reconciliation, where we find pairs of models that disagree on a region around the test point. We modify predictions that disagree, making them less biased. These three approaches can be used together or separately, and they each have distinct advantages. The reconciled predictions can then be distilled into a single interpretable model for real-world deployment. In experiments across multiple datasets, our methods reduce disagreement metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SRT is a tree-structured cache method to accelerate RL-based language model training with speculative decoding, leading to up to 2.08x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address latency and computational inefficiencies in on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for language models while maintaining distributional correctness.

Method: SRT uses a tree-structured cache to store past continuations, employing speculative decoding with the current policy and updating the cache online during training. It also utilizes idle GPU time for proactive generation.

Result: SRT reduces generation latency and inference cost per token, achieving up to 2.08x speedup in wall-clock time during rollout.

Conclusion: The approach enhances RL pipelines for language models by effectively accelerating training without compromising accuracy or reliability.

Abstract: We present Speculative Rollout with Tree-Structured Cache (SRT), a simple, model-free approach to accelerate on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for language models without sacrificing distributional correctness. SRT exploits the empirical similarity of rollouts for the same prompt across training steps by storing previously generated continuations in a per-prompt tree-structured cache. During generation, the current policy uses this tree as the draft model for performing speculative decoding. To keep the cache fresh and improve draft model quality, SRT updates trees online from ongoing rollouts and proactively performs run-ahead generation during idle GPU bubbles. Integrated into standard RL pipelines (\textit{e.g.}, PPO, GRPO and DAPO) and multi-turn settings, SRT consistently reduces generation and step latency and lowers per-token inference cost, achieving up to 2.08x wall-clock time speedup during rollout.

TL;DR: MMR-GRPO integrates Maximal Marginal Relevance into GRPO to prioritize diversity in training, reducing steps by 47.9% and wall-clock time by 70.2% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training computational efficiency for mathematical reasoning models using GRPO is hindered by its need for multiple completions per prompt.

Method: Introduced MMR-GRPO, which reweights rewards using Maximal Marginal Relevance, to favor diverse completions and enhance training convergence.

Result: MMR-GRPO achieves comparable peak performance but requires significantly fewer training steps (47.9%) and wall-clock time (70.2%).

Conclusion: MMR-GRPO proves effective in improving efficiency without compromising the model’s performance across benchmarks, models, and variants.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has become a standard approach for training mathematical reasoning models; however, its reliance on multiple completions per prompt makes training computationally expensive. Although recent work has reduced the number of training steps required to reach peak performance, the overall wall-clock training time often remains unchanged or even increases due to higher per-step cost. We propose MMR-GRPO, which integrates Maximal Marginal Relevance to reweigh rewards based on completion diversity. Our key insight is that semantically redundant completions contribute limited marginal learning signal; prioritizing diverse solutions yields more informative updates and accelerates convergence. Extensive evaluations across three model sizes (1.5B, 7B, 8B), three GRPO variants, and five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that MMR-GRPO achieves comparable peak performance while requiring on average 47.9% fewer training steps and 70.2% less wall-clock time. These gains are consistent across models, methods, and benchmarks. We will release our code, trained models, and experimental protocols.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DASD-4B-Thinking, an open-source lightweight reasoning model that achieves state-of-the-art performance in math, scientific reasoning, and code generation while requiring far fewer training samples and improving upon current distillation practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address shortcomings in sequence-level distillation methods used for training reasoning models, specifically the lack of explicit teacher-student interaction and misaligned output distributions, and to create a highly capable model with fewer training resources.

Method: Critically reevaluating sequence-level distillation and identifying its limitations, the authors design methodological innovations to enhance the distillation training pipeline for improved generalization and efficiency.

Result: DASD-4B-Thinking achieves competitive SOTA results with just 448K training samples, outperforming comparable and even larger models across benchmarks in reasoning domains.

Conclusion: The proposed distillation method effectively enables smaller models like DASD-4B-Thinking to perform better with fewer resources. The research paves the way for more efficient open-source models.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce DASD-4B-Thinking, a lightweight yet highly capable, fully open-source reasoning model. It achieves SOTA performance among open-source models of comparable scale across challenging benchmarks in mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation -- even outperforming several larger models. We begin by critically reexamining a widely adopted distillation paradigm in the community: SFT on teacher-generated responses, also known as sequence-level distillation. Although a series of recent works following this scheme have demonstrated remarkable efficiency and strong empirical performance, they are primarily grounded in the SFT perspective. Consequently, these approaches focus predominantly on designing heuristic rules for SFT data filtering, while largely overlooking the core principle of distillation itself -- enabling the student model to learn the teacher's full output distribution so as to inherit its generalization capability. Specifically, we identify three critical limitations in current practice: i) Inadequate representation of the teacher's sequence-level distribution; ii) Misalignment between the teacher's output distribution and the student's learning capacity; and iii) Exposure bias arising from teacher-forced training versus autoregressive inference. In summary, these shortcomings reflect a systemic absence of explicit teacher-student interaction throughout the distillation process, leaving the essence of distillation underexploited. To address these issues, we propose several methodological innovations that collectively form an enhanced sequence-level distillation training pipeline. Remarkably, DASD-4B-Thinking obtains competitive results using only 448K training samples -- an order of magnitude fewer than those employed by most existing open-source efforts. To support community research, we publicly release our models and the training dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance LLM reasoning efficiency by addressing the computational and latency challenges of generating and selecting multiple traces in reasoning tasks.

Method: Introduces STEP: a framework that trains a step scorer using hidden state evaluations to dynamically prune traces based on quality and GPU memory limits, aiming to lower computational demands while maintaining reasoning quality.

Result: STEP achieves 45%-70% reduction in end-to-end inference latency and improved reasoning accuracy on diverse benchmarks compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: STEP offers an efficient and precise approach for reasoning in LLMs, balancing computational efficiency with high-quality outcomes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance reasoning capabilities through test-time scaling by generating multiple traces. However, the combination of lengthy reasoning traces with multiple sampling introduces substantial computation and high end-to-end latency. Prior work on accelerating this process has relied on similarity-based or confidence-based pruning, but these signals do not reliably indicate trace quality. To address these limitations, we propose STEP: Step-level Trace Evaluation and Pruning, a novel pruning framework that evaluates reasoning steps using hidden states and dynamically prunes unpromising traces during generation. We train a lightweight step scorer to estimate trace quality, and design a GPU memory-aware pruning strategy that triggers pruning as the GPU memory is saturated by KV cache to reduce end-to-end latency. Experiments across challenging reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that STEP reduces end-to-end inference latency by 45%-70% on average compared to self-consistency while also improving reasoning accuracy.

Abstract: Concrete is the most widely used construction material worldwide; however, reliable prediction of compressive strength remains challenging due to material heterogeneity, variable mix proportions, and sensitivity to field and environmental conditions. Recent advances in artificial intelligence enable data-driven modeling frameworks capable of supporting automated decision-making in construction quality control. This study leverages an industry-scale dataset consisting of approximately 70,000 compressive strength test records to evaluate and compare multiple predictive approaches, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, transformer-based neural networks, and embedding-based neural networks. The models incorporate key mixture design and placement variables such as water cement ratio, cementitious material content, slump, air content, temperature, and placement conditions. Results indicate that the embedding-based neural network consistently outperforms traditional machine learning and transformer-based models, achieving a mean 28-day prediction error of approximately 2.5%. This level of accuracy is comparable to routine laboratory testing variability, demonstrating the potential of embedding-based learning frameworks to enable automated, data-driven quality control and decision support in large-scale construction operations.

*Haijian Shao,Wei Liu,Xing Deng,Daze Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses imbalanced and noisy electrocardiogram (ECG) data issues using a wavelet transform-based feature fusion method, achieving high classification accuracy on the CPSC 2018 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome challenges posed by imbalanced data and noise in ECG datasets, especially for underrepresented cardiac conditions, to enhance automated ECG classification accuracy.

Method: The paper employs a wavelet transform-based interclass feature fusion approach to balance the training and test datasets. The methodology integrates feature generation with original data to improve classification accuracy.

Result: The proposed model achieved recognition accuracies between 92% and 99% across various ECG categories, surpassing previous algorithms on the CPSC 2018 dataset.

Conclusion: Wavelet transform-based data fusion effectively addresses class imbalance and noise-related issues in ECG classification, significantly improving performance and surpassing existing methods.

Abstract: Imbalanced electrocardiogram (ECG) data hampers the efficacy and resilience of algorithms in the automated processing and interpretation of cardiovascular diagnostic information, which in turn impedes deep learning-based ECG classification. Notably, certain cardiac conditions that are infrequently encountered are disproportionately underrepresented in these datasets. Although algorithmic generation and oversampling of specific ECG signal types can mitigate class skew, there is a lack of consensus regarding the effectiveness of such techniques in ECG classification. Furthermore, the methodologies and scenarios of ECG acquisition introduce noise, further complicating the processing of ECG data. This paper presents a significantly enhanced ECG classifier that simultaneously addresses both class imbalance and noise-related challenges in ECG analysis, as observed in the CPSC 2018 dataset. Specifically, we propose the application of feature fusion based on the wavelet transform, with a focus on wavelet transform-based interclass fusion, to generate the training feature library and the test set feature library. Subsequently, the original training and test data are amalgamated with their respective feature databases, resulting in more balanced training and test datasets. Employing this approach, our ECG model achieves recognition accuracies of up to 99%, 98%, 97%, 98%, 96%, 92%, and 93% for Normal, AF, I-AVB, LBBB, RBBB, PAC, PVC, STD, and STE, respectively. Furthermore, the average recognition accuracy for these categories ranges between 92\% and 98\%. Notably, our proposed data fusion methodology surpasses any known algorithms in terms of ECG classification accuracy in the CPSC 2018 dataset.

*Shijian Ma,Yan Lin,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EvasionBench, a benchmark dataset for detecting evasive answers in earnings calls, and proposes a disagreement-mining annotation framework that improves model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the difficulty of detecting evasive answers in earnings calls due to the lack of large-scale datasets in this domain.

Method: The authors developed EvasionBench containing training and human-annotated test samples, and employed a multi-model disagreement-mining framework that resolves labeling conflicts using a 'judge' model.

Result: The technique improved model accuracy by 2.4%, providing evidence that disagreement-mining acts as implicit regularization. The Eva-4B model achieved 81.3% accuracy, significantly outperforming its base model.

Conclusion: Disagreement-mining and EvasionBench provide an effective methodology for detecting evasive answers in a scalable manner, advancing financial transparency.

Abstract: Detecting evasive answers in earnings calls is critical for financial transparency, yet progress is hindered by the lack of large-scale benchmarks. We introduce EvasionBench, comprising 30,000 training samples and 1,000 human-annotated test samples (Cohen's Kappa 0.835) across three evasion levels. Our key contribution is a multi-model annotation framework leveraging a core insight: disagreement between frontier LLMs signals hard examples most valuable for training. We mine boundary cases where two strong annotators conflict, using a judge to resolve labels. This approach outperforms single-model distillation by 2.4 percent, with judge-resolved samples improving generalization despite higher training loss (0.421 vs 0.393) - evidence that disagreement mining acts as implicit regularization. Our trained model Eva-4B (4B parameters) achieves 81.3 percent accuracy, outperforming its base by 25 percentage points and approaching frontier LLM performance at a fraction of inference cost.

*Jinshuai Bai,Haolin Li,Zahra Sharif Khodaei,M. H. Aliabadi,YuanTong Gu,Xi-Qiao Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DiSOL (Discrete Solution Operator Learning), a method for learning discrete solution procedures in PDEs under geometry-dependent structural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural operator learning approaches struggle with varying geometries that induce structural changes, including topological transformations and boundary condition variations. A new approach is needed to handle these challenges effectively.

Method: DiSOL factorizes the problem-solving process into discrete learning stages, combining local encoding, multiscale assembly, and implicit solution reconstruction, designed to adapt to geometry-dependent discrete structural variations.

Result: DiSOL consistently delivers stable and accurate predictions across various geometry-dependent problems, outperforming traditional methods in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings with complex geometric changes.

Conclusion: DiSOL represents a new paradigm in scientific machine learning, providing procedural operator representations tailored to problems dominated by geometry-induced structural variability.

Abstract: Neural operator learning accelerates PDE solution by approximating operators as mappings between continuous function spaces. Yet in many engineering settings, varying geometry induces discrete structural changes, including topological changes, abrupt changes in boundary conditions or boundary types, and changes in the effective computational domain, which break the smooth-variation premise. Here we introduce Discrete Solution Operator Learning (DiSOL), a complementary paradigm that learns discrete solution procedures rather than continuous function-space operators. DiSOL factorizes the solver into learnable stages that mirror classical discretizations: local contribution encoding, multiscale assembly, and implicit solution reconstruction on an embedded grid, thereby preserving procedure-level consistency while adapting to geometry-dependent discrete structures. Across geometry-dependent Poisson, advection-diffusion, linear elasticity, as well as spatiotemporal heat-conduction problems, DiSOL produces stable and accurate predictions under both in-distribution and strongly out-of-distribution geometries, including discontinuous boundaries and topological changes. These results highlight the need for procedural operator representations in geometry-dominated regimes and position discrete solution operator learning as a distinct, complementary direction in scientific machine learning.

*Yang Nan,Qihao Wen,Jiahao Wang,Pengfei He,Ravi Tandon,Yong Ge,Han Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces PRISM, a framework using Shapley Measures to improve and bring transparency to probability estimation by Large Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods of prompting LLMs for probability estimation are noisy and lack transparency, limiting their effectiveness in decision-making applications.

Method: The paper proposes PRISM, which uses Shapley values to quantify each input factor's contribution to an LLM's prediction and reconstructs a calibrated probability estimate.

Result: Experiments show PRISM outperforms direct prompting and other baselines in predictive accuracy across several domains like finance, healthcare, and agriculture.

Conclusion: PRISM enhances both predictive performance and transparency, providing a reliable pipeline for LLM-based decision-making while building trust through its clear factor contribution visualizations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential to estimate the probability of uncertain events, by leveraging their extensive knowledge and reasoning capabilities. This ability can be applied to support intelligent decision-making across diverse fields, such as financial forecasting and preventive healthcare. However, directly prompting LLMs for probability estimation faces significant challenges: their outputs are often noisy, and the underlying predicting process is opaque. In this paper, we propose PRISM: Probability Reconstruction via Shapley Measures, a framework that brings transparency and precision to LLM-based probability estimation. PRISM decomposes an LLM's prediction by quantifying the marginal contribution of each input factor using Shapley values. These factor-level contributions are then aggregated to reconstruct a calibrated final estimate. In our experiments, we demonstrate PRISM improves predictive accuracy over direct prompting and other baselines, across multiple domains including finance, healthcare, and agriculture. Beyond performance, PRISM provides a transparent prediction pipeline: our case studies visualize how individual factors shape the final estimate, helping build trust in LLM-based decision support systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces KTCF, a counterfactual explanation method for Knowledge Tracing, which improves student modeling by making AI more understandable for educational stakeholders, achieving significant gains in performance. It also provides actionable educational instructions to reduce study burden.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research explores the potential of AI, specifically Knowledge Tracing (KT), in improving adaptive and scalable education.

Conclusion: Counterfactual explanations, as demonstrated through KTCF, provide a promising approach for enhancing explainability and usability of AI in education. Future research should focus on educational grounding and stakeholder-centered approaches to expand its practical applications.

Abstract: Using Artificial Intelligence to improve teaching and learning benefits greater adaptivity and scalability in education. Knowledge Tracing (KT) is recognized for student modeling task due to its superior performance and application potential in education. To this end, we conceptualize and investigate counterfactual explanation as the connection from XAI for KT to education. Counterfactual explanations offer actionable recourse, are inherently causal and local, and easy for educational stakeholders to understand who are often non-experts. We propose KTCF, a counterfactual explanation generation method for KT that accounts for knowledge concept relationships, and a post-processing scheme that converts a counterfactual explanation into a sequence of educational instructions. We experiment on a large-scale educational dataset and show our KTCF method achieves superior and robust performance over existing methods, with improvements ranging from 5.7% to 34% across metrics. Additionally, we provide a qualitative evaluation of our post-processing scheme, demonstrating that the resulting educational instructions help in reducing large study burden. We show that counterfactuals have the potential to advance the responsible and practical use of AI in education. Future works on XAI for KT may benefit from educationally grounded conceptualization and developing stakeholder-centered methods.

*Aaron R. Flouro,Shawn P. Chadwick*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an operator-theoretic framework for multi-teacher knowledge distillation, defining axioms for valid aggregation operators and proving their theoretical robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a theoretical foundation in multi-teacher ensemble knowledge distillation and ensure robust aggregation of supervision from diverse teacher models.

Method: The authors define five axioms (convexity, positivity, continuity, weight monotonicity, and temperature coherence) for knowledge aggregation operators and prove their validity and operator-agnostic guarantees.

Result: The framework demonstrates reduced stochastic variance, lower supervisory bias, and provides guarantees for log-loss, Jensen-type bounds, and safety properties. Variance-reduction results are extended to correlated-error settings for linear aggregation operators.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a theoretical baseline for multi-teacher distillation, validates diverse aggregation operators, and offers flexibility for practical implementation strategies.

Abstract: Building on the probability-domain distillation framework of Sparse-KD, we develop an axiomatic, operator-theoretic framework for multi-teacher ensemble knowledge distillation. Rather than prescribing a specific aggregation formula, we define five core axioms governing valid knowledge aggregation operators, encompassing convexity, positivity, continuity, weight monotonicity, and temperature coherence. We prove the existence and non-uniqueness of operator families satisfying these axioms, establishing that multiple distinct aggregation mechanisms conform to the same foundational principles.
  Within this framework, we establish operator-agnostic guarantees showing that multi-teacher aggregation reduces both stochastic variance and systematic supervisory bias under heterogeneous teachers, while providing Jensen-type bounds, log-loss guarantees, and safety attenuation properties. For aggregation operators linear in teacher weights, we further establish classical ensemble variance-reduction results under standard independence assumptions, with extensions to correlated-error regimes. The framework provides theoretical grounding for multi-teacher distillation from diverse frontier models while admitting multiple valid implementation strategies.

*Pengyang Shao,Naixin Zhai,Lei Chen,Yonghui Yang,Fengbin Zhu,Xun Yang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes BalDRO, a framework for effectively unlearning specific information in Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle imbalances in unlearning difficulty across samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem arises as LLMs increasingly affect online content, necessitating the removal of targeted information (unlearning) while overcoming challenges caused by varying unlearning difficulties across data samples.

Method: The authors introduced BalDRO with two variants: BalDRO-G (a GroupDRO-based approximation) and BalDRO-DV (a Donsker-Varadhan dual adaptation) to address asynchronous forgetting and achieve balanced unlearning.

Result: BalDRO showed significant improvement in unlearning quality and maintaining model utility, as evidenced by experiments on TOFU and MUSE datasets.

Conclusion: BalDRO presents a viable solution for balanced LLM unlearning, addressing sample-wise imbalances effectively, and the authors provided code for reproducibility of their results.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly shape online content, removing targeted information from well-trained LLMs (also known as LLM unlearning) has become critical for web governance. A key challenge lies in sample-wise imbalance within the forget set: different samples exhibit widely varying unlearning difficulty, leading to asynchronous forgetting where some knowledge remains insufficiently erased while others become over-forgotten. To address this, we propose BalDRO, a novel and efficient framework for balanced LLM unlearning. BalDRO formulates unlearning as a min-sup process: an inner step identifies a worst-case data distribution that emphasizes hard-to-unlearn samples, while an outer step updates model parameters under this distribution. We instantiate BalDRO via two efficient variants: BalDRO-G, a discrete GroupDRO-based approximation focusing on high-loss subsets, and BalDRO-DV, a continuous Donsker-Varadhan dual method enabling smooth adaptive weighting within standard training pipelines. Experiments on TOFU and MUSE show that BalDRO significantly improves both forgetting quality and model utility over existing methods, and we release code for reproducibility.

*Lang Xiong,Ning Liu,Ao Ren,Yuheng Bai,Haining Fang,BinYan Zhang,Zhe Jiang,Yujuan Tan,Duo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces $D^2Prune$, a pruning method for large language models (LLMs) aiming to effectively reduce computational needs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational difficulties of deploying large language models (LLMs) and improve upon existing pruning methods that fail to account for activation distribution shifts and long-tail characteristics of activations.

Method: The paper proposes a dual Taylor expansion-based error estimation for better pruning and an attention-aware dynamic update strategy to preserve long-tail attention patterns.

Result: $D^2Prune$ outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods across various LLMs and even demonstrates adaptability to vision models like DeiT with superior performance on ImageNet-1K.

Conclusion: $D^2Prune$ is an effective solution for compressing large models, offering accurate performance across both language and vision models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant deployment challenges due to their massive computational demands. % While pruning offers a promising compression solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) They neglect activation distribution shifts between calibration data and test data, resulting in inaccurate error estimations; (2) They overlook the long-tail distribution characteristics of activations in the attention module. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel pruning method, $D^2Prune$. First, we propose a dual Taylor expansion-based method that jointly models weight and activation perturbations for precise error estimation, leading to precise pruning mask selection and weight updating and facilitating error minimization during pruning. % Second, we propose an attention-aware dynamic update strategy that preserves the long-tail attention pattern by jointly minimizing the KL divergence of attention distributions and the reconstruction error. Extensive experiments show that $D^2Prune$ consistently outperforms SOTA methods across various LLMs (e.g., OPT-125M, LLaMA2/3, and Qwen3). Moreover, the dynamic attention update mechanism also generalizes well to ViT-based vision models like DeiT, achieving superior accuracy on ImageNet-1K.

*Xinzi Tan,Kejian Zhang,Junhan Yu,Doudou Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work introduces a novel attention mechanism, Hawkes Attention, for Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTPPs), effectively capturing type-specific temporal effects and outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Transformer-based methods for MTPPs fail to adequately capture type-specific temporal effects due to their reliance on shared or parametric decay structures and limited temporal modeling through positional encodings.

Method: The study proposes the Hawkes Attention mechanism, derived from multivariate Hawkes process theory. It uses learnable per-type neural kernels to modulate attention components, thereby integrating event timing and content interaction, and learning excitation patterns specific to event types.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the Hawkes Attention outperforms baseline models in MTPP tasks and shows applicability to other temporal structures like time series forecasting.

Conclusion: Hawkes Attention is a significant advancement for modeling MTPPs, unifying temporal and content interactions while improving performance over existing methods. It also extends to broader temporal modeling applications.

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTPPs) arise naturally in medical, social, commercial, and financial domains. However, existing Transformer-based methods mostly inject temporal information only via positional encodings, relying on shared or parametric decay structures, which limits their ability to capture heterogeneous and type-specific temporal effects. Inspired by this observation, we derive a novel attention operator called Hawkes Attention from the multivariate Hawkes process theory for MTPP, using learnable per-type neural kernels to modulate query, key and value projections, thereby replacing the corresponding parts in the traditional attention. Benefited from the design, Hawkes Attention unifies event timing and content interaction, learning both the time-relevant behavior and type-specific excitation patterns from the data. The experimental results show that our method achieves better performance compared to the baselines. In addition to the general MTPP, our attention mechanism can also be easily applied to specific temporal structures, such as time series forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GIFT, a novel approach to Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) post-training, addressing limitations of standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) by ensuring distributional consistency for better Reinforcement Learning (RL) outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-training methods for LRMs using SFT and RL face optimization issues due to rigid supervision in SFT, which limits exploration during RL.

Method: The paper proposes GIFT, a framework reformulating SFT as a finite-temperature energy model to prevent distributional collapse and enable better RL. It modifies SFT using a supervised finite-temperature energy potential rather than a rigid zero-temperature model.

Result: GIFT enables consistent objectives in post-training and significantly outperforms standard SFT and other baselines when initializing models for RL.

Conclusion: GIFT improves post-training processes for LRMs with a robust mathematical approach, ensuring better exploration in RL and achieving superior overall performance in post-training pipelines.

Abstract: The prevailing post-training paradigm for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs)--Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL)--suffers from an intrinsic optimization mismatch: the rigid supervision inherent in SFT induces distributional collapse, thereby exhausting the exploration space necessary for subsequent RL. In this paper, we reformulate SFT within a unified post-training framework and propose Gibbs Initialization with Finite Temperature (GIFT). We characterize standard SFT as a degenerate zero-temperature limit that suppresses base priors. Conversely, GIFT incorporates supervision as a finite-temperature energy potential, establishing a distributional bridge that ensures objective consistency throughout the post-training pipeline. Our experiments demonstrate that GIFT significantly outperforms standard SFT and other competitive baselines when utilized for RL initialization, providing a mathematically principled pathway toward achieving global optimality in post-training.

*Chaitanya Kharyal,Calarina Muslimani,Matthew E. Taylor*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces R4, a rating-based RL method leveraging ratings as ordinal targets for reward learning, and demonstrates superior or equal performance to existing methods with less human feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the bottleneck in RL caused by manual reward function design, leveraging human ratings for richer and less demanding supervision.

Method: The proposed method, R4, employs a ranking mean squared error (rMSE) loss to learn from trajectory-rating pairs using differentiable soft ranks for optimization.

Result: R4 outperforms or matches existing rating and preference-based approaches on robotic locomotion tasks with reduced feedback.

Conclusion: The study validates R4 as an effective, feedback-efficient method for RL, backed by theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Reward design remains a significant bottleneck in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world problems. A popular alternative is reward learning, where reward functions are inferred from human feedback rather than manually specified. Recent work has proposed learning reward functions from human feedback in the form of ratings, rather than traditional binary preferences, enabling richer and potentially less cognitively demanding supervision. Building on this paradigm, we introduce a new rating-based RL method, Ranked Return Regression for RL (R4). At its core, R4 employs a novel ranking mean squared error (rMSE) loss, which treats teacher-provided ratings as ordinal targets. Our approach learns from a dataset of trajectory-rating pairs, where each trajectory is labeled with a discrete rating (e.g., "bad," "neutral," "good"). At each training step, we sample a set of trajectories, predict their returns, and rank them using a differentiable sorting operator (soft ranks). We then optimize a mean squared error loss between the resulting soft ranks and the teacher's ratings. Unlike prior rating-based approaches, R4 offers formal guarantees: its solution set is provably minimal and complete under mild assumptions. Empirically, using simulated human feedback, we demonstrate that R4 consistently matches or outperforms existing rating and preference-based RL methods on robotic locomotion benchmarks from OpenAI Gym and the DeepMind Control Suite, while requiring significantly less feedback.

*Xinyang Chen,Huidong Jin,Yu Huang,Zaiwen Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces XLinear, a lightweight time series forecasting model leveraging MLPs to efficiently handle temporal and exogenous dependencies, achieving superior accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of current forecasting models, particularly their inefficiency in capturing asymmetrical causal relationships and dependency on high computation, while leveraging exogenous data for improved forecasts.

Method: Proposes XLinear, which uses global tokens for interactions between endogenous and exogenous variables, employs MLPs with sigmoid activations to extract patterns and dependencies, and a prediction head for accurate forecasts.

Result: XLinear outperforms state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and computational efficiency on multiple benchmarks and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: XLinear demonstrates that lightweight MLP-based models can effectively and efficiently utilize exogenous data for enhanced forecasting accuracy, offering an alternative to transformer-based approaches.

Abstract: Despite the prevalent assumption of uniform variable importance in long-term time series forecasting models, real world applications often exhibit asymmetric causal relationships and varying data acquisition costs. Specifically, cost-effective exogenous data (e.g., local weather) can unilaterally influence dynamics of endogenous variables, such as lake surface temperature. Exploiting these links enables more effective forecasts when exogenous inputs are readily available. Transformer-based models capture long-range dependencies but incur high computation and suffer from permutation invariance. Patch-based variants improve efficiency yet can miss local temporal patterns. To efficiently exploit informative signals across both the temporal dimension and relevant exogenous variables, this study proposes XLinear, a lightweight time series forecasting model built upon MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs). XLinear uses a global token derived from an endogenous variable as a pivotal hub for interacting with exogenous variables, and employs MLPs with sigmoid activation to extract both temporal patterns and variate-wise dependencies. Its prediction head then integrates these signals to forecast the endogenous series. We evaluate XLinear on seven standard benchmarks and five real-world datasets with exogenous inputs. Compared with state-of-the-art models, XLinear delivers superior accuracy and efficiency for both multivariate forecasts and univariate forecasts influenced by exogenous inputs.

TL;DR: The paper proposes the HGATSolver for addressing the challenges of learning-based simulation of Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) systems by encoding them as a heterogeneous graph and stabilizing computations using innovative techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based solvers struggle with capturing the heterogeneous dynamics and domain inconsistencies of FSI systems, causing prediction instability across fluid and solid regions.

Method: A Heterogeneous Graph Attention Solver (HGATSolver) is developed that models FSI systems as a heterogeneous graph. It uses specialized message-passing mechanisms, a physics-conditioned gating mechanism for time-stepping stability, and an inter-domain gradient-balancing loss to optimize prediction across domains.

Result: HGATSolver achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks and a public dataset, proving its efficacy in surrogate modeling for coupled multi-physics systems.

Conclusion: The study establishes HGATSolver as an effective and stable framework for simulating FSI systems, addressing key challenges in learning-based solvers for multi-physics interactions.

Abstract: Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) systems involve distinct physical domains, fluid and solid, governed by different partial differential equations and coupled at a dynamic interface. While learning-based solvers offer a promising alternative to costly numerical simulations, existing methods struggle to capture the heterogeneous dynamics of FSI within a unified framework. This challenge is further exacerbated by inconsistencies in response across domains due to interface coupling and by disparities in learning difficulty across fluid and solid regions, leading to instability during prediction. To address these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Graph Attention Solver (HGATSolver). HGATSolver encodes the system as a heterogeneous graph, embedding physical structure directly into the model via distinct node and edge types for fluid, solid, and interface regions. This enables specialized message-passing mechanisms tailored to each physical domain. To stabilize explicit time stepping, we introduce a novel physics-conditioned gating mechanism that serves as a learnable, adaptive relaxation factor. Furthermore, an Inter-domain Gradient-Balancing Loss dynamically balances the optimization objectives across domains based on predictive uncertainty. Extensive experiments on two constructed FSI benchmarks and a public dataset demonstrate that HGATSolver achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing an effective framework for surrogate modeling of coupled multi-physics systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data inefficiency in current LLM fine-tuning methods which either rely on costly expert data or discard negative samples.

Method: The proposed RIFT framework integrates scalar rewards to reweight the loss and effectively repurpose both positive and negative self-generated samples, avoiding issues like training collapse with a stabilized loss formulation.

Result: Extensive experiments indicate that RIFT consistently surpasses RFT in performance across mathematical benchmarks and diverse base models.

Conclusion: RIFT is a robust, data-efficient alternative for aligning LLMs using mixed-quality, self-generated data.

Abstract: While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) are standard for LLM alignment, they either rely on costly expert data or discard valuable negative samples, leading to data inefficiency. To address this, we propose Reward Informed Fine-Tuning (RIFT), a simple yet effective framework that utilizes all self-generated samples. Unlike the hard thresholding of RFT, RIFT repurposes negative trajectories, reweighting the loss with scalar rewards to learn from both the positive and negative trajectories from the model outputs. To overcome the training collapse caused by naive reward integration, where direct multiplication yields an unbounded loss, we introduce a stabilized loss formulation that ensures numerical robustness and optimization efficiency. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks across various base models show that RIFT consistently outperforms RFT. Our results demonstrate that RIFT is a robust and data-efficient alternative for alignment using mixed-quality, self-generated data.

Motivation: To address challenges of learning where feedback reliability is unobservable, leading to potentially high-confidence yet incorrect beliefs in autonomous systems.

Method: The authors propose a Monitor-Trust-Regulator (MTR) framework featuring self-diagnosis to assess experience credibility from internal learner dynamics without relying on external feedback reliability labels.

Result: Empirical results show the approach improves belief accuracy in reinforcement learning with corrupted rewards and uncovers critical dissociations in supervised learning, providing diagnostics for belief dynamics.

Conclusion: MTR and self-diagnosis offer a formalized approach and practical template to improve learning reliability in settings with unobservable feedback reliability, emphasizing introspective regulatory processes.

Abstract: Learning under unobservable feedback reliability poses a distinct challenge beyond optimization robustness: a system must decide whether to learn from an experience, not only how to learn stably. We study this setting as Epistemic Identifiability under Unobservable Reliability (EIUR), where each experience has a latent credibility, reliable and unreliable feedback can be locally indistinguishable, and data are generated in a closed loop by the learner's own evolving beliefs and actions. In EIUR, standard robust learning can converge stably yet form high-confidence, systematically wrong beliefs.
  We propose metacognitive regulation as a practical response: a second, introspective control loop that infers experience credibility from endogenous evidence in the learner's internal dynamics. We formalize this as a modular Monitor-Trust-Regulator (MTR) decomposition and instantiate it with self-diagnosis, which maintains a slowly varying experience-trust variable that softly modulates learning updates, without exogenous reliability labels or an explicit corruption model.
  Empirically, in the EIUR regimes studied here, self-diagnosis is associated with improved epistemic identifiability. In reinforcement learning, it enables calibrated skepticism and recovery under systematically corrupted rewards. In supervised learning, it exposes a critical dissociation: performance recovery does not imply epistemic recovery. Accuracy can rebound while internal belief dynamics remain locked-in by early misleading data, a failure detectable only through introspective diagnostics. Together, MTR and self-diagnosis provide an organizing abstraction and a concrete design template for intrinsic reliability assessment in autonomous learning under unobservable reliability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MOF-LLM, an innovative framework for predicting metal-organic framework (MOF) structures using Large Language Models (LLMs), which leverages a block-level approach for enhanced accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of accurately predicting 3D structures of complex metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), valuable for applications like carbon capture and drug delivery.

Method: The method includes a novel training paradigm comprising spatial-aware continual pre-training (CPT), structural supervised fine-tuning (SFT), matching-driven reinforcement learning (RL), and the Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO) for spatial reasoning enhancement.

Result: The proposed MOF-LLM framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in MOF structure prediction and achieves superior sampling efficiency.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the capability of leveraging LLMs, with modular assembly strategies, for precise MOF structural predictions, advancing the intersection of machine learning and materials science.

Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous crystalline materials with broad applications such as carbon capture and drug delivery, yet accurately predicting their 3D structures remains a significant challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating crystals, their application to MOFs is hindered by MOFs' high atomic complexity. Inspired by the success of block-wise paradigms in deep generative models, we pioneer the use of LLMs in this domain by introducing MOF-LLM, the first LLM framework specifically adapted for block-level MOF structure prediction. To effectively harness LLMs for this modular assembly task, our training paradigm integrates spatial-aware continual pre-training (CPT), structural supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and matching-driven reinforcement learning (RL). By incorporating explicit spatial priors and optimizing structural stability via Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), our approach substantially enhances the spatial reasoning capability of a Qwen-3 8B model for accurate MOF structure prediction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MOF-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art denoising-based and LLM-based methods while exhibiting superior sampling efficiency.

*Sota Sugawara,Yuji Kawamata,Akihiro Toyoda,Tomoru Nakayama,Yukihiko Okada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DC-CFL, a federated learning framework achieving accuracy comparable to multi-round baselines with only one communication round.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of severe statistical heterogeneity across clients in federated learning while reducing the limitations posed by multiple communication rounds required for cluster estimation and model updates.

Method: DC-CFL uses a single communication round to perform client clustering and cluster-wise learning. It leverages data collaboration analysis, measures inter-client similarity based on total variation distance between label distributions, employs hierarchical clustering for client grouping, and performs cluster-wise learning within these clusters.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that DC-CFL achieves accuracy comparable to multi-round clustered federated learning methods under non-IID conditions using significantly fewer communication rounds.

Conclusion: DC-CFL is a practical and efficient solution for distributed AI model development, especially in scenarios where communication rounds are constrained.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed learning across multiple clients without sharing raw data. When statistical heterogeneity across clients is severe, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) can improve performance by grouping similar clients and training cluster-wise models. However, most CFL approaches rely on multiple communication rounds for cluster estimation and model updates, which limits their practicality under tight constraints on communication rounds. We propose Data Collaboration-based Clustered Federated Learning (DC-CFL), a single-round framework that completes both client clustering and cluster-wise learning, using only the information shared in DC analysis. DC-CFL quantifies inter-client similarity via total variation distance between label distributions, estimates clusters using hierarchical clustering, and performs cluster-wise learning via DC analysis. Experiments on multiple open datasets under representative non-IID conditions show that DC-CFL achieves accuracy comparable to multi-round baselines while requiring only one communication round. These results indicate that DC-CFL is a practical alternative for collaborative AI model development when multiple communication rounds are impractical.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoRA, a method designed for optimizing reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) by addressing limitations like optimization instability and inefficiency in existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges in existing low-rank adaptation methods for reinforcement learning, such as optimization instability, geometric misalignment, and inefficiency in computations.

Method: GeoRA leverages the compressible and anisotropic nature of reinforcement learning update subspaces. It initializes adapters using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) within a constrained geometric subspace to preserve pre-trained structures and ensures efficient dense computations.

Result: GeoRA outperformed low-rank adaptation baselines on key mathematical benchmarks and demonstrated superior generalization, performance, and resilience to out-of-domain catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: GeoRA is an effective geometry-aware approach for RLVR, addressing optimization and efficiency challenges while improving performance and achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is crucial for advancing large-scale reasoning models. However, existing parameter-efficient methods, such as PiSSA and MiLoRA, are designed for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and do not account for the distinct optimization dynamics and geometric structures of RLVR. Applying these methods directly leads to spectral collapse and optimization instability, which severely limit model performance. Meanwhile, alternative approaches that leverage update sparsity encounter significant efficiency bottlenecks on modern hardware due to unstructured computations. To address these challenges, we propose GeoRA (Geometry-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation), which exploits the anisotropic and compressible nature of RL update subspaces. GeoRA initializes adapters by extracting principal directions via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) within a geometrically constrained subspace while freezing the residual components. This method preserves the pre-trained geometric structure and enables efficient GPU computation through dense operators. Experiments on Qwen and Llama demonstrate that GeoRA mitigates optimization bottlenecks caused by geometric misalignment. It consistently outperforms established low-rank baselines on key mathematical benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Moreover, GeoRA shows superior generalization and resilience to catastrophic forgetting in out-of-domain tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ACS2 is effective at latent learning but struggles in sparse reward environments. The authors were motivated to address this limitation by integrating an approach that strengthens learning signals.

Method: The proposed method integrates ACS2 with hindsight experience replay, re-labeling visited states as virtual goals when primary goals are unmet, in order to enhance the density of learning signals.

Result: ACS2HER was evaluated on Maze 6 and FrozenLake benchmarks, showing improved learning efficiency and mastery compared to ACS2, albeit with increased classifier numerosity and computational demands.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that combining anticipatory and retrospective mechanisms in Learning Classifier Systems can significantly expedite learning, though it incurs computational costs. This marks a novel integration in the field.

Abstract: This paper introduces ACS2HER, a novel integration of the Anticipatory Classifier System (ACS2) with the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) mechanism. While ACS2 is highly effective at building cognitive maps through latent learning, its performance often stagnates in environments characterized by sparse rewards. We propose a specific architectural variant that triggers hindsight learning when the agent fails to reach its primary goal, re-labeling visited states as virtual goals to densify the learning signal. The proposed model was evaluated on two benchmarks: the deterministic \texttt{Maze 6} and the stochastic \texttt{FrozenLake}. The results demonstrate that ACS2HER significantly accelerates knowledge acquisition and environmental mastery compared to the standard ACS2. However, this efficiency gain is accompanied by increased computational overhead and a substantial expansion in classifier numerosity. This work provides the first analysis of combining anticipatory mechanisms with retrospective goal-relabeling in Learning Classifier Systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enhance CAD profile generation by integrating geometric construction sequences and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CAD methods often lack flexibility and precision in profile generation. The paper aims to improve this by incorporating systematic geometric constructions.

Method: A new method for CAD profile creation through step-by-step geometric constructions supplemented by reinforcement learning.

Result: Construction sequences reduce shape freedom, enable precise parametric editing, and reinforcement learning further enhances metrics.

Conclusion: This approach offers improved CAD profile generation quality and allows adjustable, precise parametric design.

Abstract: We introduce a new method of generating Computer Aided Design (CAD) profiles via a sequence of simple geometric constructions including curve offsetting, rotations and intersections. These sequences start with geometry provided by a designer and build up the points and curves of the final profile step by step. We demonstrate that adding construction steps between the designer's input geometry and the final profile improves generation quality in a similar way to the introduction of a chain of thought in language models. Similar to the constraints in a parametric CAD model, the construction sequences reduce the degrees of freedom in the modeled shape to a small set of parameter values which can be adjusted by the designer, allowing parametric editing with the constructed geometry evaluated to floating point precision. In addition we show that applying reinforcement learning to the construction sequences gives further improvements over a wide range of metrics, including some which were not explicitly optimized.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Sobolev-trained surrogate model for light transport in tissue to improve the accuracy of model derivatives and reduce generalization error, addressing challenges in optoacoustic imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optoacoustic imaging requires accurate recovery of tissue absorption coefficients through light transport inversion, which is challenging due to limitations in current models' accuracy and differentiability.

Method: The authors use Sobolev training to develop a neural surrogate model for light transport in tissue, aiming to enhance derivative accuracy in solving inverse problems.

Result: The Sobolev-trained surrogate model exhibited improved derivative accuracy and reduced generalization error for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples.

Conclusion: The proposed approach can significantly enhance the clinical utility of optoacoustic imaging by enabling more reliable and effective inverse problem-solving methods.

Abstract: In optoacoustic imaging, recovering the absorption coefficients of tissue by inverting the light transport remains a challenging problem. Improvements in solving this problem can greatly benefit the clinical value of optoacoustic imaging. Existing variational inversion methods require an accurate and differentiable model of this light transport. As neural surrogate models allow fast and differentiable simulations of complex physical processes, they are considered promising candidates to be used in solving such inverse problems. However, there are in general no guarantees that the derivatives of these surrogate models accurately match those of the underlying physical operator. As accurate derivatives are central to solving inverse problems, errors in the model derivative can considerably hinder high fidelity reconstructions. To overcome this limitation, we present a surrogate model for light transport in tissue that uses Sobolev training to improve the accuracy of the model derivatives. Additionally, the form of Sobolev training we used is suitable for high-dimensional models in general. Our results demonstrate that Sobolev training for a light transport surrogate model not only improves derivative accuracy but also reduces generalization error for in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples. These improvements promise to considerably enhance the utility of the surrogate model in downstream tasks, especially in solving inverse problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing quantization methods that rely on hard clipping, which can lose outlier information, and to improve accuracy by preserving precision in different value ranges.

Method: The approach involves using three adaptive scales for quantization: high-precision for small values, standard scale for normal values, and low-precision for outlier values.

Result: Quamba-SE outperforms the baseline Quamba by achieving up to a +2.68% improvement on individual benchmarks and +0.83% on average across six datasets in zero-shot benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study concludes that Quamba-SE successfully enhances quantization performance by employing adaptive scaling, preserving outlier information while maintaining overall precision and accuracy.

Abstract: We propose Quamba-SE, a soft-edge quantizer for State Space Model (SSM) activation quantization. Unlike existing methods, using standard INT8 operation, Quamba-SE employs three adaptive scales: high-precision for small values, standard scale for normal values, and low-precision for outliers. This preserves outlier information instead of hard clipping, while maintaining precision for other values. We evaluate on Mamba- 130M across 6 zero-shot benchmarks. Results show that Quamba- SE consistently outperforms Quamba, achieving up to +2.68% on individual benchmarks and up to +0.83% improvement in the average accuracy of 6 datasets.

Motivation: To address the need for clear and explainable machine learning models for deployment in critical applications.

Result: Generating such explanations is not only computationally hard but also inapproximable under certain conditions.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize challenges in explainable AI, recommending considerations for both the XAI community and policymakers in regulating AI explanations.

Abstract: Providing clear explanations to the choices of machine learning models is essential for these models to be deployed in crucial applications. Counterfactual and semi-factual explanations have emerged as two mechanisms for providing users with insights into the outputs of their models. We provide an overview of the computational complexity results in the literature for generating these explanations, finding that in many cases, generating explanations is computationally hard. We strengthen the argument for this considerably by further contributing our own inapproximability results showing that not only are explanations often hard to generate, but under certain assumptions, they are also hard to approximate. We discuss the implications of these complexity results for the XAI community and for policymakers seeking to regulate explanations in AI.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Searth Transformer and YanTian model for weather forecasting, emphasizing spherical Earth's geometry and reducing computational cost, achieving higher accuracy and longer forecast lead times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and efficiency of global medium-range weather forecasting while addressing the Earth's spherical geometry and computational challenges.

Method: The Searth Transformer incorporates zonal periodicity and meridional boundaries into window-based self-attention. It employs a Relay Autoregressive (RAR) fine-tuning strategy for efficient long-range learning.

Result: YanTian exceeds the forecast accuracy of ECMWF's high-resolution model and achieves comparable performance to AI models at much lower computational costs. It extends forecast lead times for Z500 to 10.3 days.

Conclusion: This work provides a significant advancement in weather forecasting while creating a foundation for modeling geophysical circulation systems for Earth system science.

Abstract: Accurate global medium-range weather forecasting is fundamental to Earth system science. Most existing Transformer-based forecasting models adopt vision-centric architectures that neglect the Earth's spherical geometry and zonal periodicity. In addition, conventional autoregressive training is computationally expensive and limits forecast horizons due to error accumulation. To address these challenges, we propose the Shifted Earth Transformer (Searth Transformer), a physics-informed architecture that incorporates zonal periodicity and meridional boundaries into window-based self-attention for physically consistent global information exchange. We further introduce a Relay Autoregressive (RAR) fine-tuning strategy that enables learning long-range atmospheric evolution under constrained memory and computational budgets. Based on these methods, we develop YanTian, a global medium-range weather forecasting model. YanTian achieves higher accuracy than the high-resolution forecast of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and performs competitively with state-of-the-art AI models at one-degree resolution, while requiring roughly 200 times lower computational cost than standard autoregressive fine-tuning. Furthermore, YanTian attains a longer skillful forecast lead time for Z500 (10.3 days) than HRES (9 days). Beyond weather forecasting, this work establishes a robust algorithmic foundation for predictive modeling of complex global-scale geophysical circulation systems, offering new pathways for Earth system science.

TL;DR: Graph unlearning helps in removing the impact of deleted nodes, protecting user privacy, but current methods affect fairness. FairGU is introduced to enhance both utility and fairness, proving superior over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph unlearning is essential for privacy and fairness in social networks, but existing methods fail to adequately protect sensitive attributes.

Method: FairGU comprises fairness-aware modules and data protection strategies to ensure fairness and prevent exposure of sensitive attributes during unlearning.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show superior accuracy and fairness metrics for FairGU over existing unlearning and fairness-focused graph learning methods.

Conclusion: FairGU successfully addresses fairness concerns and privacy risks in unlearning, paving the way for fair and sustainable social networks.

Abstract: Graph unlearning has emerged as a critical mechanism for supporting sustainable and privacy-preserving social networks, enabling models to remove the influence of deleted nodes and thereby better safeguard user information. However, we observe that existing graph unlearning techniques insufficiently protect sensitive attributes, often leading to degraded algorithmic fairness compared with traditional graph learning methods. To address this gap, we introduce FairGU, a fairness-aware graph unlearning framework designed to preserve both utility and fairness during the unlearning process. FairGU integrates a dedicated fairness-aware module with effective data protection strategies, ensuring that sensitive attributes are neither inadvertently amplified nor structurally exposed when nodes are removed. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate that FairGU consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph unlearning methods and fairness-enhanced graph learning baselines in terms of both accuracy and fairness metrics. Our findings highlight a previously overlooked risk in current unlearning practices and establish FairGU as a robust and equitable solution for the next generation of socially sustainable networked systems.

*Oliver Bolton,Aakanksha,Arash Ahmadian,Sara Hooker,Marzieh Fadaee,Beyza Ermis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces "simmerge," a method to efficiently predict optimal model merges for large language models (LLMs) based on task-agnostic similarity signals, avoiding costly evaluation processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Merging multiple large language models (LLMs) into one while retaining performance is challenging and often requires expensive trials. This paper aims to simplify and optimize the merging process for scalability.

Method: The authors propose 'simmerge,' a method using task-agnostic similarity signals derived from small unlabeled probes. Functional and structural features predict merge performance, choosing optimal operators, models, and merge orders without a merge-and-evaluate loop.

Result: Simmerge achieves superior performance over standard merge operators in 2-way merges of LLMs, generalizes to larger 111B-parameter models and multi-way merges, and supports dynamic integration of new tasks, operators, and models.

Conclusion: The study highlights that predictive and scalable model merger methods such as simmerge provide a cost-effective and practical approach to combining large models in a computationally efficient manner.

Abstract: Model merging enables multiple large language models (LLMs) to be combined into a single model while preserving performance. This makes it a valuable tool in LLM development, offering a competitive alternative to multi-task training. However, merging can be difficult at scale, as successful merging requires choosing the right merge operator, selecting the right models, and merging them in the right order. This often leads researchers to run expensive merge-and-evaluate searches to select the best merge. In this work, we provide an alternative by introducing \simmerge{}, \emph{a predictive merge-selection method} that selects the best merge using inexpensive, task-agnostic similarity signals between models. From a small set of unlabeled probes, we compute functional and structural features and use them to predict the performance of a given 2-way merge. Using these predictions, \simmerge{} selects the best merge operator, the subset of models to merge, and the merge order, eliminating the expensive merge-and-evaluate loop. We demonstrate that we surpass standard merge-operator performance on 2-way merges of 7B-parameter LLMs, and that \simmerge{} generalizes to multi-way merges and 111B-parameter LLM merges without retraining. Additionally, we present a bandit variant that supports adding new tasks, models, and operators on the fly. Our results suggest that learning how to merge is a practical route to scalable model composition when checkpoint catalogs are large and evaluation budgets are tight.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TOCFlow, a sampling method using flow-based generative models to meet terminal constraints efficiently with geometry-aware guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inherent challenges of sampling from distributions constrained by terminal conditions using pre-trained flow-based generative models.

Method: Formulates the problem as optimal control, utilizing Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations and deriving optimal controls. Introduces TOCFlow to enable geometry-aware sampling guidance with reduced computational cost.

Result: Demonstrates TOCFlow across tasks involving equality, inequality, and statistical constraints, showing superior constraint satisfaction and maintaining generative model quality.

Conclusion: TOCFlow provides computationally efficient, geometry-consistent sampling under constraints, improving over traditional methods for scientific applications.

Abstract: We address the problem of sampling from terminally constrained distributions with pre-trained flow-based generative models through an optimal control formulation. Theoretically, we characterize the value function by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and derive the optimal feedback control as the minimizer of the associated Hamiltonian. We show that as the control penalty increases, the controlled process recovers the reference distribution, while as the penalty vanishes, the terminal law converges to a generalized Wasserstein projection onto the constraint manifold. Algorithmically, we introduce Terminal Optimal Control with Flow-based models (TOCFlow), a geometry-aware sampling-time guidance method for pre-trained flows. Solving the control problem in a terminal co-moving frame that tracks reference trajectories yields a closed-form scalar damping factor along the Riemannian gradient, capturing second-order curvature effects without matrix inversions. TOCFlow therefore matches the geometric consistency of Gauss-Newton updates at the computational cost of standard gradient guidance. We evaluate TOCFlow on three high-dimensional scientific tasks spanning equality, inequality, and global statistical constraints, namely Darcy flow, constrained trajectory planning, and turbulence snapshot generation with Kolmogorov spectral scaling. Across all settings, TOCFlow improves constraint satisfaction over Euclidean guidance and projection baselines while preserving the reference model's generative quality.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the capability of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) for modeling and optimizing cyclic adsorption processes that rely on PDE solutions, addressing the challenge of computational expense and demonstrating accurate predictions beyond training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance the efficiency of cyclic adsorption processes like Temperature-Vacuum Swing Adsorption (TVSA) by leveraging DeepONets as surrogates for transient PDE simulations, reducing computational costs and improving optimization workflows.

Method: DeepONets were trained to map initial conditions to solution fields of PDEs governing adsorption processes. A diverse training dataset was constructed, and the models were tested for functional generalization, including unseen initial conditions and functional forms.

Result: The trained DeepONets accurately predicted solutions within and beyond the training distribution, successfully handling steep traveling fronts present in adsorption process equations.

Conclusion: DeepONets show promising capabilities as efficient surrogates for cyclic adsorption simulations, potentially accelerating simulations and optimization in adsorption technologies.

Abstract: Deep Operator Networks are emerging as fundamental tools among various neural network types to learn mappings between function spaces, and have recently gained attention due to their ability to approximate nonlinear operators. In particular, DeepONets offer a natural formulation for PDE solving, since the solution of a partial differential equation can be interpreted as an operator mapping an initial condition to its corresponding solution field. In this work, we applied DeepONets in the context of process modeling for adsorption technologies, to assess their feasibility as surrogates for cyclic adsorption process simulation and optimization. The goal is to accelerate convergence of cyclic processes such as Temperature-Vacuum Swing Adsorption (TVSA), which require repeated solution of transient PDEs, which are computationally expensive. Since each step of a cyclic adsorption process starts from the final state of the preceding step, effective surrogate modeling requires generalization across a wide range of initial conditions. The governing equations exhibit steep traveling fronts, providing a demanding benchmark for operator learning. To evaluate functional generalization under these conditions, we construct a mixed training dataset composed of heterogeneous initial conditions and train DeepONets to approximate the corresponding solution operators. The trained models are then tested on initial conditions outside the parameter ranges used during training, as well as on completely unseen functional forms. The results demonstrate accurate predictions both within and beyond the training distribution, highlighting DeepONets as potential efficient surrogates for accelerating cyclic adsorption simulations and optimization workflows.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Memory Recurrent Units (MRUs), combining persistent memory abilities of RNNs with the parallelizable computation of State-Space Models (SSMs), addressing limitations of previous architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome inefficiencies in sequence generation and limited representation capabilities of existing models like Transformers and SSMs.

Method: Introduces the Memory Recurrent Unit (MRU), leveraging multistability for persistent memory while enabling parallelizable computations.

Result: MRU, particularly its implementation as Bistable Memory Recurrent Unit (BMRU), performs well on tasks with long-term dependencies and hybridizes effectively with SSMs for improved efficiency.

Conclusion: MRUs provide a promising solution combining efficiency and persistent memory, addressing limitations in current sequence generation models.

Abstract: With the emergence of massively parallel processing units, parallelization has become a desirable property for new sequence models. The ability to parallelize the processing of sequences with respect to the sequence length during training is one of the main factors behind the uprising of the Transformer architecture. However, Transformers lack efficiency at sequence generation, as they need to reprocess all past timesteps at every generation step. Recently, state-space models (SSMs) emerged as a more efficient alternative. These new kinds of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) keep the efficient update of the RNNs while gaining parallelization by getting rid of nonlinear dynamics (or recurrence). SSMs can reach state-of-the art performance through the efficient training of potentially very large networks, but still suffer from limited representation capabilities. In particular, SSMs cannot exhibit persistent memory, or the capacity of retaining information for an infinite duration, because of their monostability. In this paper, we introduce a new family of RNNs, the memory recurrent units (MRUs), that combine the persistent memory capabilities of nonlinear RNNs with the parallelizable computations of SSMs. These units leverage multistability as a source of persistent memory, while getting rid of transient dynamics for efficient computations. We then derive a specific implementation as proof-of-concept: the bistable memory recurrent unit (BMRU). This new RNN is compatible with the parallel scan algorithm. We show that BMRU achieves good results in tasks with long-term dependencies, and can be combined with state-space models to create hybrid networks that are parallelizable and have transient dynamics as well as persistent memory.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Class Adaptive Conformal Training (CaCT), improving conformal prediction methods to produce class-conditional, informative prediction sets with guaranteed coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conformal training methods struggle to shape prediction sets in class-conditional ways and usually require knowledge of data distribution. Addressing these limitations is crucial for improving uncertainty quantification in deep learning models.

Method: The paper proposes an augmented Lagrangian optimization approach called Class Adaptive Conformal Training (CaCT), which adaptively shapes prediction sets class-conditionally without requiring prior distributional knowledge.

Result: CaCT achieves significantly smaller, more informative prediction sets compared to traditional methods, while ensuring coverage guarantees, as demonstrated on benchmarks like image and text classification tasks.

Conclusion: CaCT advances conformal prediction methods by enabling adaptive, class-conditional shaping of prediction sets, improving both informativeness and reliability of uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a variety of tasks, yet they often suffer from unreliable probability estimates. As a result, they can be overconfident in their predictions. Conformal Prediction (CP) offers a principled framework for uncertainty quantification, yielding prediction sets with rigorous coverage guarantees. Existing conformal training methods optimize for overall set size, but shaping the prediction sets in a class-conditional manner is not straightforward and typically requires prior knowledge of the data distribution. In this work, we introduce Class Adaptive Conformal Training (CaCT), which formulates conformal training as an augmented Lagrangian optimization problem that adaptively learns to shape prediction sets class-conditionally without making any distributional assumptions. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, including standard and long-tailed image recognition as well as text classification, demonstrate that CaCT consistently outperforms prior conformal training methods, producing significantly smaller and more informative prediction sets while maintaining the desired coverage guarantees.

*Wai-Lun Lam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training framework using Tsallis entropy and Hamiltonian dynamics for single-head looped Transformers to overcome non-convex loss landscapes and achieve reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of training single-head looped Transformers, which often fail due to non-convex and irregular loss landscapes and hinder the model's reasoning capability.

Method: A novel training method leveraging Tsallis entropy and Hamiltonian dynamics to reshape the loss landscape and treat parameter updates as physical flows.

Result: Successfully trained a single-head looped Transformer of dimension $d = 8$ to solve induction head tasks with input sequences of 1000 tokens.

Conclusion: The framework enables enhanced reasoning capabilities and reveals the mechanisms improving performance in single-head looped Transformers.

Abstract: Recent research suggests that looped Transformers have superior reasoning capabilities compared to standard deep architectures. Current approaches to training single-head looped architectures on benchmark tasks frequently fail or yield suboptimal performance due to a highly non-convex and irregular loss landscape. In these settings, optimization often stagnates in poor local minima and saddle points of the loss landscape, preventing the model from discovering the global minimum point. The internal mechanisms of these single-head looped transformer models remain poorly understood, and training them from scratch remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework that leverages Tsallis entropy and Hamiltonian dynamics to transform the geometry of the loss landscape. By treating the parameter updates as a physical flow, we successfully trained a single-head looped Transformer with model dimension $d = 8$ to solve induction head task with input sequence length of 1000 tokens. This success reveals the internal mechanism behind the superior reasoning capability.

### [242] [Toward Understanding Unlearning Difficulty: A Mechanistic Perspective and Circuit-Guided Difficulty Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09624)
*Jiali Cheng,Ziheng Chen,Chirag Agarwal,Hadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a metric, Circuit-guided Unlearning Difficulty (CUD), to predict the difficulty of unlearning individual samples in language models, based on model circuits and internal mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding why some samples are easier to unlearn than others, in terms of model complexity and internal mechanisms, to improve the reliability and interpretability of unlearning methods.

Method: The authors propose CUD, a pre-unlearning metric that leverages structural signals from model circuits, and conduct extensive experiments on its stability across methods.

Result: CUD reliably distinguishes between easy and hard-to-unlearn samples, revealing circuit-level patterns that correlate with unlearning difficulty.

Conclusion: CUD offers a principled, interpretable analysis of unlearning difficulty, paving the way for mechanism-driven unlearning methods in language models.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is becoming essential for building trustworthy and compliant language models. Yet unlearning success varies considerably across individual samples: some are reliably erased, while others persist despite the same procedure. We argue that this disparity is not only a data-side phenomenon, but also reflects model-internal mechanisms that encode and protect memorized information. We study this problem from a mechanistic perspective based on model circuits--structured interaction pathways that govern how predictions are formed. We propose Circuit-guided Unlearning Difficulty (CUD), a {\em pre-unlearning} metric that assigns each sample a continuous difficulty score using circuit-level signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CUD reliably separates intrinsically easy and hard samples, and remains stable across unlearning methods. We identify key circuit-level patterns that reveal a mechanistic signature of difficulty: easy-to-unlearn samples are associated with shorter, shallower interactions concentrated in earlier-to-intermediate parts of the original model, whereas hard samples rely on longer and deeper pathways closer to late-stage computation. Compared to existing qualitative studies, CUD takes a first step toward a principled, fine-grained, and interpretable analysis of unlearning difficulty; and motivates the development of unlearning methods grounded in model mechanisms.

*Ge Lei,Ferran Brosa Planella,Sterling G. Baird,Samuel J. Cooper*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces two novel LLM-driven methods for optimizing battery charging protocols, obtaining significant improvements in performance compared to traditional techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Battery charging protocol optimization is slow, costly, and non-differentiable. Existing methods heavily restrict exploration, limiting potential discovery of superior solutions.

Method: The authors propose two gradient-free methods: Prompt-to-Optimizer (P2O), which creates neural-network-based protocols trained internally, and Prompt-to-Protocol (P2P), which generates explicit functions for current and parameters using an LLM.

Result: In a fast charging scenario, both P2O and P2P improved capacity retention (state of health) by 4.2% compared to a state-of-the-art baseline, with P2P matching evaluation budgets.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively expand the space of protocol design, incorporate constraints, and optimize efficiently in high-cost experimental settings, surpassing current optimization techniques.

Abstract: Efficiently optimizing battery charging protocols is challenging because each evaluation is slow, costly, and non-differentiable. Many existing approaches address this difficulty by heavily constraining the protocol search space, which limits the diversity of protocols that can be explored, preventing the discovery of higher-performing solutions. We introduce two gradient-free, LLM-driven closed-loop methods: Prompt-to-Optimizer (P2O), which uses an LLM to propose the code for small neural-network-based protocols, which are then trained by an inner loop, and Prompt-to-Protocol (P2P), which simply writes an explicit function for the current and its scalar parameters. Across our case studies, LLM-guided P2O outperforms neural networks designed by Bayesian optimization, evolutionary algorithms, and random search. In a realistic fast charging scenario, both P2O and P2P yield around a 4.2 percent improvement in state of health (capacity retention based health metric under fast charging cycling) over a state-of-the-art multi-step constant current (CC) baseline, with P2P achieving this under matched evaluation budgets (same number of protocol evaluations). These results demonstrate that LLMs can expand the space of protocol functional forms, incorporate language-based constraints, and enable efficient optimization in high cost experimental settings.

*Aditya Tanna,Pratinav Seth,Mohamed Bouadi,Vinay Kumar Sankarapu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies fine-tuning approaches for Tabular Foundation Models (TFMs) across multiple benchmarks, highlighting that zero-shot TFMs achieve strong performance and fine-tuning effects depend on data and model specifics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the understanding of the effectiveness of fine-tuning TFMs and highlight the conditions under which fine-tuning methods are beneficial or limited.

Method: The study compares various tuning approaches such as Zero-Shot, Meta-Learning, Supervised (SFT), and PEFT, analyzing dataset factors (e.g., imbalance, size, dimensionality).

Result: Zero-shot TFMs perform strongly while the impact of fine-tuning varies with different conditions. SFT often reduces accuracy or calibration, while PEFT and meta-learning offer moderate improvements.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning has limitations and benefits depending on data and model specifics. Practical guidelines are offered for when fine-tuning TFMs is most effective, prioritizing zero-shot capabilities.

Abstract: Tabular Foundation Models (TFMs) have recently shown strong in-context learning capabilities on structured data, achieving zero-shot performance comparable to traditional machine learning methods. We find that zero-shot TFMs already achieve strong performance, while the benefits of fine-tuning are highly model and data-dependent. Meta-learning and PEFT provide moderate gains under specific conditions, whereas full supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often reduces accuracy or calibration quality. This work presents the first comprehensive study of fine-tuning in TFMs across benchmarks including TALENT, OpenML-CC18, and TabZilla. We compare Zero-Shot, Meta-Learning, Supervised (SFT), and parameter-efficient (PEFT) approaches, analyzing how dataset factors such as imbalance, size, and dimensionality affect outcomes. Our findings cover performance, calibration, and fairness, offering practical guidelines on when fine-tuning is most beneficial and its limitations.

### [245] [Disentangling Task Conflicts in Multi-Task LoRA via Orthogonal Gradient Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09684)
*Ziyu Yang,Guibin Chen,Yuxin Yang,Aoxiong Zeng,Xiangquan Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ortho-LoRA, a method that addresses the gradient conflicts in multi-task learning using LoRA for language models, improving performance with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter-efficient deployment of LLMs via multi-task learning often suffers from negative transfer due to conflicting gradients, particularly in LoRA's low-rank constraint.

Method: Ortho-LoRA dynamically projects conflicting task gradients onto orthogonal subspaces within LoRA's intrinsic structure, mitigating task interference.

Result: Experiments on the GLUE benchmark show Ortho-LoRA reduces task conflicts and recovers 95% of the performance loss compared to single-task baselines, with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: Ortho-LoRA effectively addresses challenges in multi-task low-rank adaptation, achieving near single-task performance while maintaining parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) combined with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising direction for parameter-efficient deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). By sharing a single adapter across multiple tasks, one can significantly reduce storage overhead. However, this approach suffers from negative transfer, where conflicting gradient updates from distinct tasks degrade the performance of individual tasks compared to single-task fine-tuning. This problem is exacerbated in LoRA due to the low-rank constraint, which limits the optimization landscape's capacity to accommodate diverse task requirements. In this paper, we propose Ortho-LoRA, a gradient projection method specifically tailored for the bipartite structure of LoRA. Ortho-LoRA dynamically projects conflicting task gradients onto the orthogonal complement of each other within the intrinsic LoRA subspace. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark demonstrate that Ortho-LoRA effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming standard joint training and recovering 95\% of the performance gap between multi-task and single-task baselines with negligible computational overhead.

TL;DR: The paper proposes SiliconHealth, a blockchain-based healthcare system using repurposed Bitcoin mining ASICs to establish cost-effective and secure medical record management in resource-constrained regions, especially sub-Saharan Africa.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of affordable and reliable healthcare infrastructure in resource-constrained regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, benefiting over 600 million people without access to basic health information systems.

Method: The system uses repurposed Bitcoin mining ASICs for creating a four-tier network infrastructure with Deterministic Hardware Fingerprinting for secure validation, Reed-Solomon LSB watermarking for image authentication, and semantic RAG for intelligent queries, while ensuring offline synchronization for intermittent connectivity.

Result: Validation experiments proved the efficiency, hardware universality, and cost-effectiveness of the setup, achieving significant cost reduction (96% compared to GPU-based systems) and economic feasibility for rural clinics.

Conclusion: SiliconHealth demonstrates the feasibility of deploying secure, tamper-proof electronic medical records systems in resource-constrained regions, paving a way for healthcare accessibility through innovative hardware repurposing and low-cost solutions.

Abstract: This paper presents SiliconHealth, a comprehensive blockchain-based healthcare infrastructure designed for resource-constrained regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa. We demonstrate that obsolete Bitcoin mining Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) can be repurposed to create a secure, low-cost, and energy-efficient medical records system. The proposed architecture employs a four-tier hierarchical network: regional hospitals using Antminer S19 Pro (90+ TH/s), urban health centers with Antminer S9 (14 TH/s), rural clinics equipped with Lucky Miner LV06 (500 GH/s, 13W), and mobile health points with portable ASIC devices. We introduce the Deterministic Hardware Fingerprinting (DHF) paradigm, which repurposes SHA-256 mining ASICs as cryptographic proof generators, achieving 100% verification rate across 23 test proofs during 300-second validation sessions. The system incorporates Reed-Solomon LSB watermarking for medical image authentication with 30-40% damage tolerance, semantic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for intelligent medical record queries, and offline synchronization protocols for intermittent connectivity. Economic analysis demonstrates 96% cost reduction compared to GPU-based alternatives, with total deployment cost of $847 per rural clinic including 5-year solar power infrastructure. Validation experiments on Lucky Miner LV06 (BM1366 chip, 5nm) achieve 2.93 MH/W efficiency and confirm hardware universality. This work establishes a practical framework for deploying verifiable, tamper-proof electronic health records in regions where traditional healthcare IT infrastructure is economically unfeasible, potentially benefiting over 600 million people lacking access to basic health information systems.

*Russell M. Martin,Steven H. Collins*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Sampling CMA-ES (AS-CMA) to optimize robot policies faster and more efficiently by dynamically adjusting evaluation times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the speed-accuracy tradeoff in experimental robotic optimization by devising an approach that ensures consistent precision without excessive tuning.

Method: Proposed an extension of CMA-ES: Adaptive Sampling CMA-ES (AS-CMA), which adjusts evaluation time dynamically based on predicted sorting difficulty, tested it across simulated and real-world scenarios.

Result: AS-CMA achieved up to 65% faster convergence and up to 76% lower cost in simulated landscapes compared to alternatives. In experiments with exoskeletons, it performed reliably while minimizing setup complexity.

Conclusion: AS-CMA improves optimization efficiency under noisy conditions with minimal impact on setup complexity, proving useful for robotic optimization tasks.

Abstract: Experimental robot optimization often requires evaluating each candidate policy for seconds to minutes. The chosen evaluation time influences optimization because of a speed-accuracy tradeoff: shorter evaluations enable faster iteration, but are also more subject to noise. Here, we introduce a supplement to the CMA-ES optimization algorithm, named Adaptive Sampling CMA-ES (AS-CMA), which assigns sampling time to candidates based on predicted sorting difficulty, aiming to achieve consistent precision. We compared AS-CMA to CMA-ES and Bayesian optimization using a range of static sampling times in four simulated cost landscapes. AS-CMA converged on 98% of all runs without adjustment to its tunable parameter, and converged 24-65% faster and with 29-76% lower total cost than each landscape's best CMA-ES static sampling time. As compared to Bayesian optimization, AS-CMA converged more efficiently and reliably in complex landscapes, while in simpler landscapes, AS-CMA was less efficient but equally reliable. We deployed AS-CMA in an exoskeleton optimization experiment and found the optimizer's behavior was consistent with expectations. These results indicate that AS-CMA can improve optimization efficiency in the presence of noise while minimally affecting optimization setup complexity and tuning requirements.

### [248] [Revisiting Disaggregated Large Language Model Serving for Performance and Energy Implications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08833)
*Jiaxi Li,Yue Zhu,Eun Kyung Lee,Klara Nahrstedt*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: This paper assesses the performance and energy efficiency of prefill-decode disaggregated serving for Large Language Models (LLMs), comparing various KV cache transfer paths and optimization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks systematic benchmarking of KV cache transfer performance and energy efficiency in disaggregated serving and does not rigorously evaluate optimization techniques in this context.

Method: The authors evaluate prefill-decode disaggregation by including a colocated serving baseline, testing various KV cache transfer mediums, and profiling setups with dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) to analyze performance-energy trade-offs.

Result: The study finds that performance benefits are not inherent in disaggregated serving, as they depend on factors like request load and KV transfer mediums. Additionally, disaggregation incurs higher energy consumption and does not benefit from stage-wise frequency scaling.

Conclusion: Prefill-decode disaggregation can offer performance advantages under specific conditions but comes with energy efficiency trade-offs, requiring careful consideration of its use in LLM serving.

Abstract: Different from traditional Large Language Model (LLM) serving that colocates the prefill and decode stages on the same GPU, disaggregated serving dedicates distinct GPUs to prefill and decode workload. Once the prefill GPU completes its task, the KV cache must be transferred to the decode GPU. While existing works have proposed various KV cache transfer paths across different memory and storage tiers, there remains a lack of systematic benchmarking that compares their performance and energy efficiency. Meanwhile, although optimization techniques such as KV cache reuse and frequency scaling have been utilized for disaggregated serving, their performance and energy implications have not been rigorously benchmarked. In this paper, we fill this research gap by re-evaluating prefill-decode disaggregation under different KV transfer mediums and optimization strategies. Specifically, we include a new colocated serving baseline and evaluate disaggregated setups under different KV cache transfer paths. Through GPU profiling using dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), we identify and compare the performance-energy Pareto frontiers across all setups to evaluate the potential energy savings enabled by disaggregation. Our results show that performance benefits from prefill-decode disaggregation are not guaranteed and depend on the request load and KV transfer mediums. In addition, stage-wise independent frequency scaling enabled by disaggregation does not lead to energy saving due to inherently higher energy consumption of disaggregated serving.

### [249] [LookAhead: The Optimal Non-decreasing Index Policy for a Time-Varying Holding Cost problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08960)
*Keerthana Gurushankar,Zhouzi Li,Mor Harchol-Balter,Alan Scheller-Wolf*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: This paper introduces the LookAhead policy as the first optimal index policy for scheduling in the Time-Varying Holding Cost (TVHC) problem, specifically tackling a two-class M/M/1 queue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of optimizing scheduling policies under TVHC conditions, where holding costs increase with job age, and no prior optimal solutions exist outside asymptotic scenarios.

Method: Developed the LookAhead policy, which determines scheduling decisions based on jobs' future holding costs after a calculated lookahead amount.

Result: Derivation of the optimal lookahead amount and establishment of the LookAhead policy as optimal for the given scenario.

Conclusion: Successfully identified an optimal solution for a specific case of the TVHC scheduling problem, providing a foundation for future advancements in this field.

Abstract: In practice, the cost of delaying a job can grow as the job waits. Such behavior is modeled by the Time-Varying Holding Cost (TVHC) problem, where each job's instantaneous holding cost increases with its current age (a job's age is the time since it arrived). The goal of the TVHC problem is to find a scheduling policy that minimizes the time-average total holding cost across all jobs.
  However, no optimality results are known for the TVHC problem outside of the asymptotic regime. In this paper, we study a simple yet still challenging special case: A two-class M/M/1 queue in which class 1 jobs incur a non-decreasing, time-varying holding cost and class 2 jobs incur a constant holding cost.
  Our main contribution is deriving the first optimal (non-decreasing) index policy for this special case of the TVHC problem. Our optimal policy, called LookAhead, stems from the following idea: Rather than considering each job's current holding cost when making scheduling decisions, we should look at their cost some $X$ time into the future, where this $X$ is intuitively called the ``lookahead amount." This paper derives that optimal lookahead amount.

*Izumi Tanaka,Ken Sakayori,Shinya Takamaeda-Yamazaki,Naoki Kobayashi*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a formal translation framework using relational Hoare logic to optimize HLS memory systems, achieving significant FPGA performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing specialized memory systems for hardware accelerators using HLS requires manual adjustments as existing tools lack robustness and transparency.

Method: They develop a framework using relational Hoare logic that transforms naïve HLS programs by automating memory optimization and enforcing efficient processing patterns.

Result: Experiments with their prototype and existing HLS compilers on FPGA hardware yield notable performance improvements.

Conclusion: The approach enhances HLS usability by ensuring robust and automated memory optimizations with substantial performance benefits.

Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) is a powerful tool for developing efficient hardware accelerators that rely on specialized memory systems to achieve sufficient on-chip data reuse and off-chip bandwidth utilization. However, even with HLS, designing such systems still requires careful manual tuning, as automatic optimizations provided by existing tools are highly sensitive to programming style and often lack transparency. To address these issues, we present a formal translation framework based on relational Hoare logic, which enables robust and transparent transformations. Our method recognizes complex memory access patterns in naïve HLS programs and automatically transforms them by inserting on-chip buffers to enforce linear access to off-chip memory, and by replacing non-sequential processing with stream processing, while preserving program semantics. Experiments using our prototype translator, combined with an off-the-shelf HLS compiler and a real FPGA board, have demonstrated significant performance improvements.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: MLIR-Forge introduces a random program generator framework to test compiler intermediate representations efficiently, showcasing its adaptability across multiple languages/dialects and identifying numerous bugs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective testing of domain-specific language compilers, particularly their intermediate representations (IRs), is critical as IRs increase complexity while requiring precise optimizations.

Method: MLIR-Forge framework simplifies program generation by dividing the process into reusable logic and language-specific building blocks, utilizing common tools for flexible and efficient testing.

Result: The framework generated programs for MLIR dialects, WebAssembly, and DaCe in under a week each, revealing respective bugs after extensive testing (9 for MLIR, 15 for WebAssembly, 774 for DaCe).

Conclusion: MLIR-Forge simplifies the development of random program generators for compiler IR testing, making the process faster, reusable, and effective in identifying bugs across diverse languages.

Abstract: Optimizing compilers are essential for the efficient and correct execution of software across various scientific fields. Domain-specific languages (DSL) typically use higher level intermediate representations (IR) in their compiler pipelines for domain-specific optimizations. As these IRs add to complexity, it is crucial to test them thoroughly. Random program generators have proven to be an effective tool to test compilers through differential and fuzz testing. However, developing specialized program generators for compiler IRs is not straightforward and demands considerable resources. We introduce MLIR-Forge, a novel random program generator framework that leverages the flexibility of MLIR, aiming to simplify the creation of specialized program generators. MLIR-Forge achieves this by splitting the generation process into fundamental building blocks that are language specific, and reusable program creation logic that constructs random programs from these building blocks. This hides complexity and furthermore, even the language specific components can be defined using a set of common tools. We demonstrate MLIR-Forge's capabilities by generating MLIR with built-in dialects, WebAssembly, and a data-centric program representation, DaCe -- requiring less than a week of development time in total for each of them. Using the generated programs we conduct differential testing and find 9 MLIR, 15 WebAssembly, and 774 DaCe groups of bugs with the corresponding program generators, after running them until the rate of new bugs stagnates.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle fairness and privacy concerns in robotic decision-making driven by generative AI, ensuring ethical use and trust.

Method: The authors develop a utility-aware fairness metric, analyze its interaction with privacy budgets, and test the framework in a robot navigation task.

Result: The framework illustrates that privacy budgets can be utilized to achieve fairness goals, showing their interplay in robotic systems.

Conclusion: The approach strengthens the ethical deployment of autonomous robots by establishing a joint consideration of privacy and fairness.

Abstract: Complex decision-making by autonomous machines and algorithms could underpin the foundations of future society. Generative AI is emerging as a powerful engine for such transitions. However, we show that Generative AI-driven developments pose a critical pitfall: fairness concerns. In robotic applications, although intuitions about fairness are common, a precise and implementable definition that captures user utility and inherent data randomness is missing. Here we provide a utility-aware fairness metric for robotic decision making and analyze fairness jointly with user-data privacy, deriving conditions under which privacy budgets govern fairness metrics. This yields a unified framework that formalizes and quantifies fairness and its interplay with privacy, which is tested in a robot navigation task. In view of the fact that under legal requirements, most robotic systems will enforce user privacy, the approach shows surprisingly that such privacy budgets can be jointly used to meet fairness targets. Addressing fairness concerns in the creative combined consideration of privacy is a step towards ethical use of AI and strengthens trust in autonomous robots deployed in everyday environments.

Result: Results from experiments on Maniskill simulations and three real-world robotic systems demonstrate the framework's superior performance and generalization capabilities compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed RGMP-S framework effectively enhances humanoid robot manipulation by addressing key challenges in generalization and efficiency, offering a robust solution validated through empirical studies, with resources made available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Humanoid robot manipulation is a crucial research area for executing diverse human-level tasks, involving high-level semantic reasoning and low-level action generation. However, precise scene understanding and sample-efficient learning from human demonstrations remain critical challenges, severely hindering the applicability and generalizability of existing frameworks. This paper presents a novel RGMP-S, Recurrent Geometric-prior Multimodal Policy with Spiking features, facilitating both high-level skill reasoning and data-efficient motion synthesis. To ground high-level reasoning in physical reality, we leverage lightweight 2D geometric inductive biases to enable precise 3D scene understanding within the vision-language model. Specifically, we construct a Long-horizon Geometric Prior Skill Selector that effectively aligns the semantic instructions with spatial constraints, ultimately achieving robust generalization in unseen environments. For the data efficiency issue in robotic action generation, we introduce a Recursive Adaptive Spiking Network. We parameterize robot-object interactions via recursive spiking for spatiotemporal consistency, fully distilling long-horizon dynamic features while mitigating the overfitting issue in sparse demonstration scenarios. Extensive experiments are conducted across the Maniskill simulation benchmark and three heterogeneous real-world robotic systems, encompassing a custom-developed humanoid, a desktop manipulator, and a commercial robotic platform. Empirical results substantiate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines and validate the efficacy of the proposed modules in diverse generalization scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing soft robotic grippers, primarily pneumatically actuated, lack sufficient force for handling large, heavy objects. Hydraulic actuation offers a solution by delivering higher power through increased pressure.

Method: A hydraulic soft gripper was designed using a mathematical model to optimize parameters like pressure, bending angle, mass, and force. Materials were selected based on finite element analysis to ensure durability and functionality.

Result: The gripper successfully demonstrated the ability to handle 20 kg objects, along with closed-loop control of the finger bending angle.

Conclusion: Hydraulic actuation, coupled with an optimized design, enables soft grippers to manage heavier objects effectively, marking a significant advancement in robotic grasping technologies.

Abstract: This paper presents a design methodology of a hydraulically-driven soft robotic gripper for grasping a large and heavy object -- approximately 10 - 20 kg with 20 - 30 cm diameter. Most existing soft grippers are pneumatically actuated with several hundred kPa pressure, and cannot generate output force sufficient for such a large and heavy object. Instead of pneumatic actuation, hydraulic actuation has a potential to generate much larger power by several MPa pressure. In this study, we develop a hydraulically-driven soft gripper, in which its basic design parameters are determined based on a mathematical model that represents the relationship among the driving pressure, bending angle, object mass and grasping force. Moreover, we selected materials suitable for grasping a heavier object, based on the finite element analysis result of the detailed design. We report experimental results on a 20 kg object grasping and closed-loop control of the finger bending angle.

Result: CEI facilitated data and policy transfer across 16 embodiments in 3 simulation tasks and between different real-world robots in 6 tasks, achieving an average transfer ratio of 82.4%. It also enabled spatial generalization and multimodal motion generation.

Conclusion: CEI enhances the generalization capability of robotic models by efficiently transferring skills across diverse robot morphologies, proving its potential to overcome dataset biases and expand the adaptability of robotics systems.

Abstract: Robotic foundation models trained on large-scale manipulation datasets have shown promise in learning generalist policies, but they often overfit to specific viewpoints, robot arms, and especially parallel-jaw grippers due to dataset biases. To address this limitation, we propose Cross-Embodiment Interface (\CEI), a framework for cross-embodiment learning that enables the transfer of demonstrations across different robot arm and end-effector morphologies. \CEI introduces the concept of \textit{functional similarity}, which is quantified using Directional Chamfer Distance. Then it aligns robot trajectories through gradient-based optimization, followed by synthesizing observations and actions for unseen robot arms and end-effectors. In experiments, \CEI transfers data and policies from a Franka Panda robot to \textbf{16} different embodiments across \textbf{3} tasks in simulation, and supports bidirectional transfer between a UR5+AG95 gripper robot and a UR5+Xhand robot across \textbf{6} real-world tasks, achieving an average transfer ratio of 82.4\%. Finally, we demonstrate that \CEI can also be extended with spatial generalization and multimodal motion generation capabilities using our proposed techniques.

*Paul Brunzema,Thomas Lew,Ray Zhang,Takeru Shirasawa,John Subosits,Marcus Greiff*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a vision-enabled Bayesian dynamics model for robotic control systems that anticipates environmental changes and improves performance in challenging conditions like wet roads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional methods in adapting to rapidly changing environmental conditions and improve proactive robotic system control for safety-critical and high-performance scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a vision-conditioned variational Bayesian last-layer dynamics model that uses feature-wise affine transformations to incorporate visual context into dynamics predictions. It is tested in an optimal controller for vehicle racing.

Result: In experiments with a Lexus LC500 on a wet racing track, the vision-conditioned model successfully completed all 12 laps whereas the baselines without visual input consistently failed.

Conclusion: Vision-conditioning enhances proactive dynamics adaptation in robotic systems, improving safety and performance in dynamic and unpredictable conditions.

Abstract: Agile control of robotic systems often requires anticipating how the environment affects system behavior. For example, a driver must perceive the road ahead to anticipate available friction and plan actions accordingly. Achieving such proactive adaptation within autonomous frameworks remains a challenge, particularly under rapidly changing conditions. Traditional modeling approaches often struggle to capture abrupt variations in system behavior, while adaptive methods are inherently reactive and may adapt too late to ensure safety. We propose a vision-conditioned variational Bayesian last-layer dynamics model that leverages visual context to anticipate changes in the environment. The model first learns nominal vehicle dynamics and is then fine-tuned with feature-wise affine transformations of latent features, enabling context-aware dynamics prediction. The resulting model is integrated into an optimal controller for vehicle racing. We validate our method on a Lexus LC500 racing through water puddles. With vision-conditioning, the system completed all 12 attempted laps under varying conditions. In contrast, all baselines without visual context consistently lost control, demonstrating the importance of proactive dynamics adaptation in high-performance applications.

*Shuoye Li,Zhiyuan Song,Yulin Li,Zhihai Bi,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method leveraging nonlinear polynomial-based separators for collision avoidance in trajectory optimization, overcoming limitations of convex approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional methods that rely on convex approximations for collision avoidance, which lead to overly conservative results in cluttered, narrow environments.

Method: The proposed approach utilizes nonlinear separating hypersurfaces parameterized by polynomial functions and formulates an NLP problem to jointly optimize the robot's trajectory and separating polynomials for geometry-aware collision avoidance.

Result: The method demonstrates effective collision-free, smooth, and agile robot navigation in both simulated and real-world scenarios, outperforming convex-based methods.

Conclusion: The integration of polynomial hypersurfaces facilitates practical and efficient collision avoidance in complex scenarios without relying on conservative convex approximations.

Abstract: An emerging class of trajectory optimization methods enforces collision avoidance by jointly optimizing the robot's configuration and a separating hyperplane. However, as linear separators only apply to convex sets, these methods require convex approximations of both the robot and obstacles, which becomes an overly conservative assumption in cluttered and narrow environments. In this work, we unequivocally remove this limitation by introducing nonlinear separating hypersurfaces parameterized by polynomial functions. We first generalize the classical separating hyperplane theorem and prove that any two disjoint bounded closed sets in Euclidean space can be separated by a polynomial hypersurface, serving as the theoretical foundation for nonlinear separation of arbitrary geometries. Building on this result, we formulate a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem that jointly optimizes the robot's trajectory and the coefficients of the separating polynomials, enabling geometry-aware collision avoidance without conservative convex simplifications. The optimization remains efficiently solvable using standard NLP solvers. Simulation and real-world experiments with nonconvex robots demonstrate that our method achieves smooth, collision-free, and agile maneuvers in environments where convex-approximation baselines fail.

### [259] [ReflexDiffusion: Reflection-Enhanced Trajectory Planning for High-lateral-acceleration Scenarios in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09377)
*Xuemei Yao,Xiao Yang,Jianbin Sun,Liuwei Xie,Xuebin Shao,Xiyu Fang,Hang Su,Kewei Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReflexDiffusion enhances autonomous vehicle trajectory planning, focusing on high-risk maneuvers by introducing reflective adjustments to diffusion-based methods, resulting in significant safety improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of unsafe and suboptimal trajectory planning in autonomous vehicles, particularly in critical high-lateral-acceleration scenarios where traditional methods fail due to data imbalance in training.

Method: The paper introduces ReflexDiffusion, a framework that improves diffusion-based trajectory planners via a gradient-based adjustment during iterative denoising to emphasize critical signals like road curvature and vehicle dynamics, ensuring adherence to physical constraints.

Result: ReflexDiffusion improved driving performance by 14.1% on the nuPlan Test14-hard benchmark in high-lateral-acceleration scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ReflexDiffusion effectively enhances safety-critical trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles by dynamically optimizing safety and stability constraints at inference time, with a design that integrates into existing systems.

Abstract: Generating safe and reliable trajectories for autonomous vehicles in long-tail scenarios remains a significant challenge, particularly for high-lateral-acceleration maneuvers such as sharp turns, which represent critical safety situations. Existing trajectory planners exhibit systematic failures in these scenarios due to data imbalance. This results in insufficient modelling of vehicle dynamics, road geometry, and environmental constraints in high-risk situations, leading to suboptimal or unsafe trajectory prediction when vehicles operate near their physical limits. In this paper, we introduce ReflexDiffusion, a novel inference-stage framework that enhances diffusion-based trajectory planners through reflective adjustment. Our method introduces a gradient-based adjustment mechanism during the iterative denoising process: after each standard trajectory update, we compute the gradient between the conditional and unconditional noise predictions to explicitly amplify critical conditioning signals, including road curvature and lateral vehicle dynamics. This amplification enforces strict adherence to physical constraints, particularly improving stability during high-lateral-acceleration maneuvers where precise vehicle-road interaction is paramount. Evaluated on the nuPlan Test14-hard benchmark, ReflexDiffusion achieves a 14.1% improvement in driving score for high-lateral-acceleration scenarios over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. This demonstrates that inference-time trajectory optimization can effectively compensate for training data sparsity by dynamically reinforcing safety-critical constraints near handling limits. The framework's architecture-agnostic design enables direct deployment to existing diffusion-based planners, offering a practical solution for improving autonomous vehicle safety in challenging driving conditions.

TL;DR: This paper explores how data quantity and diversity impact the generalization of visual navigation policies using a large-scale crowd-sourced dataset and demonstrates the critical importance of data diversity for effective navigation in new environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generalizing imitation-learned navigation policies to unseen environments by studying the effect of data quantity and diversity in visual navigation.

Method: The study utilizes a 4,565-hour crowd-sourced dataset from 161 global locations to train point goal navigation policies, evaluating their performance across 125 km of autonomous driving in four countries.

Result: Large-scale data enabled zero-shot navigation in unfamiliar environments, with data diversity significantly reducing errors. Regression-based models outperformed others with noisy crowd-sourced data.

Conclusion: Diverse training data is more impactful than quantity for generalizing visual navigation. The paper highlights efficient ways to train robust policies and releases the study's resources for further exploration.

Abstract: Generalization of imitation-learned navigation policies to environments unseen in training remains a major challenge. We address this by conducting the first large-scale study of how data quantity and data diversity affect real-world generalization in end-to-end, map-free visual navigation. Using a curated 4,565-hour crowd-sourced dataset collected across 161 locations in 35 countries, we train policies for point goal navigation and evaluate their closed-loop control performance on sidewalk robots operating in four countries, covering 125 km of autonomous driving.
  Our results show that large-scale training data enables zero-shot navigation in unknown environments, approaching the performance of policies trained with environment-specific demonstrations. Critically, we find that data diversity is far more important than data quantity. Doubling the number of geographical locations in a training set decreases navigation errors by ~15%, while performance benefit from adding data from existing locations saturates with very little data. We also observe that, with noisy crowd-sourced data, simple regression-based models outperform generative and sequence-based architectures. We release our policies, evaluation setup and example videos on the project page.

### [261] [CLARE: Continual Learning for Vision-Language-Action Models via Autonomous Adapter Routing and Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09512)
*Ralf Römer,Yi Zhang,Angela P. Schoellig*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CLARE, a parameter-efficient framework for exemplar-free continual learning in vision-language-action models, autonomously adapts to new tasks without catastrophic forgetting and outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to train robots for complex manipulation tasks are unsuitable for long-term operation as they face limitations such as reliance on exemplars, struggles with extended task sequences, or task identifiers.

Method: CLARE incorporates lightweight modular adapters in feedforward layers, autonomously expands the model when required for new tasks, and uses autoencoder-based routing to activate relevant adapters during deployment without task labels.

Result: CLARE demonstrated superior performance on new tasks while preventing catastrophic forgetting in extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark. It surpassed even exemplar-based methods.

Conclusion: CLARE facilitates efficient continual learning in robotics, enabling real-world adaptability to new environments and tasks while preserving learned knowledge.

Abstract: To teach robots complex manipulation tasks, it is now a common practice to fine-tune a pre-trained vision-language-action model (VLA) on task-specific data. However, since this recipe updates existing representations, it is unsuitable for long-term operation in the real world, where robots must continually adapt to new tasks and environments while retaining the knowledge they have already acquired. Existing continual learning methods for robotics commonly require storing previous data (exemplars), struggle with long task sequences, or rely on task identifiers for deployment. To address these limitations, we propose CLARE, a general, parameter-efficient framework for exemplar-free continual learning with VLAs. CLARE introduces lightweight modular adapters into selected feedforward layers and autonomously expands the model only where necessary when learning a new task, guided by layer-wise feature similarity. During deployment, an autoencoder-based routing mechanism dynamically activates the most relevant adapters without requiring task labels. Through extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark, we show that CLARE achieves high performance on new tasks without catastrophic forgetting of earlier tasks, significantly outperforming even exemplar-based methods.

TL;DR: This study tackles the issue of enabling humanoid robots to interact physically with humans by proposing a novel pipeline and policy, PAIR and D-STAR, which ensure consistency and responsiveness in human-humanoid interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to advance humanoid-robot physical interaction capabilities, addressing the lack of high-quality Human-Humanoid Interaction (HHoI) data and the failures of standard methods to adapt Human-Human Interaction (HHI) data.

Method: The study introduces PAIR, a contact-centric pipeline preserving contact semantics for HHoI data generation, and D-STAR, a hierarchical policy that improves temporal and spatial reasoning for synchronized interactions.

Result: The framework demonstrates significant performance improvements over baseline approaches through rigorous simulations, validating its ability to learn intricate whole-body interactions from HHI data.

Conclusion: The authors present a comprehensive pipeline that resolves limitations in current methods, offering a strong foundation for human-humanoid collaborative interactions through innovative data retargeting and learning techniques.

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to physically interact with humans is a critical frontier, but progress is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality Human-Humanoid Interaction (HHoI) data. While leveraging abundant Human-Human Interaction (HHI) data presents a scalable alternative, we first demonstrate that standard retargeting fails by breaking the essential contacts. We address this with PAIR (Physics-Aware Interaction Retargeting), a contact-centric, two-stage pipeline that preserves contact semantics across morphology differences to generate physically consistent HHoI data. This high-quality data, however, exposes a second failure: conventional imitation learning policies merely mimic trajectories and lack interactive understanding. We therefore introduce D-STAR (Decoupled Spatio-Temporal Action Reasoner), a hierarchical policy that disentangles when to act from where to act. In D-STAR, Phase Attention (when) and a Multi-Scale Spatial module (where) are fused by the diffusion head to produce synchronized whole-body behaviors beyond mimicry. By decoupling these reasoning streams, our model learns robust temporal phases without being distracted by spatial noise, leading to responsive, synchronized collaboration. We validate our framework through extensive and rigorous simulations, demonstrating significant performance gains over baseline approaches and a complete, effective pipeline for learning complex whole-body interactions from HHI data.

Motivation: Improve SLAM technology by integrating semantic layers to enhance autonomous navigation and perception in complex environments.

Method: Fuse visible and infrared images at the pixel level, project LiDAR point clouds, segment heat sources, and include thermal information as a semantic layer onto 3D maps.

Result: Generated 3D maps are geometrically accurate and contain critical semantic information about the environment.

Conclusion: This approach is valuable for applications like disaster assessment and industrial maintenance due to its improved navigation and environment understanding capabilities.

Abstract: In complex environments, autonomous robot navigation and environmental perception pose higher requirements for SLAM technology. This paper presents a novel method for semantically enhancing 3D point cloud maps with thermal information. By first performing pixel-level fusion of visible and infrared images, the system projects real-time LiDAR point clouds onto this fused image stream. It then segments heat source features in the thermal channel to instantly identify high temperature targets and applies this temperature information as a semantic layer on the final 3D map. This approach generates maps that not only have accurate geometry but also possess a critical semantic understanding of the environment, making it highly valuable for specific applications like rapid disaster assessment and industrial preventive maintenance.

*Deeksha Nandal,Riccardo Revalor,Soham Dan,Debjit Pal*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LAUDE is a framework that leverages Large-Language Models for generating unit tests and debugging hardware designs with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in creating effective unit tests and debugging hardware design failures, which are time-intensive and require deep technical understanding.

Method: The paper introduces LAUDE, a framework that combines semantic design source code understanding with Chain-of-Thought reasoning from Large-Language Models. It uses prompt engineering and execution feedback for better results.

Result: LAUDE effectively detects and debugs issues in hardware designs, achieving up to 100% bug detection in combinational designs and a high rate of success in sequential debugging.

Conclusion: The proposed framework streamlines unit test generation and fault diagnosis for hardware designs, offering significant improvements in both efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Unit tests are critical in the hardware design lifecycle to ensure that component design modules are functionally correct and conform to the specification before they are integrated at the system level. Thus developing unit tests targeting various design features requires deep understanding of the design functionality and creativity. When one or more unit tests expose a design failure, the debugging engineer needs to diagnose, localize, and debug the failure to ensure design correctness, which is often a painstaking and intense process. In this work, we introduce LAUDE, a unified unit-test generation and debugging framework for hardware designs that cross-pollinates the semantic understanding of the design source code with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of foundational Large-Language Models (LLMs). LAUDE integrates prompt engineering and design execution information to enhance its unit test generation accuracy and code debuggability. We apply LAUDE with closed- and open-source LLMs to a large corpus of buggy hardware design codes derived from the VerilogEval dataset, where generated unit tests detected bugs in up to 100% and 93% of combinational and sequential designs and debugged up to 93% and 84% of combinational and sequential designs, respectively.

*Mustafa Degerli*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper discusses the integration of Large Language Models in software engineering education, emphasizing their impact on competencies and proposing new educational frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the growing disparity between traditional software engineering education and the realities of automation and AI-driven tools in professional workflows.

Method: The paper uses a conceptual research approach to propose a theoretical framework and pedagogical design model for integrating LLMs into technical education.

Result: The framework identifies a shift in focus from manual skills to critical evaluation and highlights inadequacies in traditional integrity mechanisms, suggesting transparency-based approaches instead.

Conclusion: Curriculum adaptation must evolve to align with AI's impact on software engineering education, necessitating future empirical studies to assess the effectiveness of proposed interventions.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, into professional workflows is increasingly reshaping software engineering practices. These tools have lowered the cost of code generation, explanation, and testing, while introducing new forms of automation into routine development tasks. In contrast, most of the software engineering and computer engineering curricula remain closely aligned with pedagogical models that equate manual syntax production with technical competence. This growing misalignment raises concerns regarding assessment validity, learning outcomes, and the development of foundational skills. Adopting a conceptual research approach, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing how generative AI alters core software engineering competencies and introduces a pedagogical design model for LLM-integrated education. Attention is given to computer engineering programs in Turkey, where centralized regulation, large class sizes, and exam-oriented assessment practices amplify these challenges. The framework delineates how problem analysis, design, implementation, and testing increasingly shift from construction toward critique, validation, and human-AI stewardship. In addition, the paper argues that traditional plagiarism-centric integrity mechanisms are becoming insufficient, motivating a transition toward a process transparency model. While this work provides a structured proposal for curriculum adaptation, it remains a theoretical contribution; the paper concludes by outlining the need for longitudinal empirical studies to evaluate these interventions and their long-term impacts on learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Cloud-Native moves to AI-Native systems, rendering black-box evaluation insufficient due to their focus on individual model capabilities and lack of system-level insights.

Method: Develop AI-NativeBench rooted in Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) standards to analyze agent spans in distributed systems.

Result: The benchmark reveals engineering issues overlooked in traditional metrics, such as lightweight models outperforming flagships in protocol adherence and self-healing workflows increasing failure costs.

Conclusion: AI-NativeBench offers systematic evidence to prioritize system-level analysis for reliable AI architecture development, facilitating reproducibility with open-source tools.

Abstract: The transition from Cloud-Native to AI-Native architectures is fundamentally reshaping software engineering, replacing deterministic microservices with probabilistic agentic services. However, this shift renders traditional black-box evaluation paradigms insufficient: existing benchmarks measure raw model capabilities while remaining blind to system-level execution dynamics. To bridge this gap, we introduce AI-NativeBench, the first application-centric and white-box AI-Native benchmark suite grounded in Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) standards. By treating agentic spans as first-class citizens within distributed traces, our methodology enables granular analysis of engineering characteristics beyond simple capabilities. Leveraging this benchmark across 21 system variants, we uncover critical engineering realities invisible to traditional metrics: a parameter paradox where lightweight models often surpass flagships in protocol adherence, a pervasive inference dominance that renders protocol overhead secondary, and an expensive failure pattern where self-healing mechanisms paradoxically act as cost multipliers on unviable workflows. This work provides the first systematic evidence to guide the transition from measuring model capability to engineering reliable AI-Native systems. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we have open-sourced the benchmark and dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address persistent challenges in parameter configuration, interface inconsistency across environments, and lack of reproducibility in computational workflows.

Method: Developed EZInput, a Python library utilizing declarative specifications to automatically generate interfaces, validate parameters, and ensure cross-environment session persistence.

Result: EZInput enables researchers to easily create, share, and reuse configurations using lightweight YAML files, streamlining exploration, reducing repetitive input, and enhancing reproducibility.

Conclusion: EZInput supports diverse scientific input requirements, improves usability through validation and feedback, and promotes adaptable, reproducible workflows in computational tools.

Abstract: Researchers face a persistent barrier when applying computational algorithms with parameter configuration typically demanding programming skills, interfaces differing across environments, and settings rarely persisting between sessions. This fragmentation forces repetitive input, slows iterative exploration, and undermines reproducibility because parameter choices are difficult to record, share, and reuse. We present EZInput, a cross-runtime environment Python library enabling algorithm developers to automatically generate graphical user interfaces that make their computational tools accessible to end-users without programming expertise. EZInput employs a declarative specification system where developers define input requirements and validation constraints once; the library then handles environment detection, interface rendering, parameter validation, and session persistence across Jupyter notebooks, Google Colab, and terminal environments. This "write once, run anywhere" architecture enables researchers to prototype in notebooks and deploy identical parameter configurations for batch execution on remote systems without code changes or manual transcription. Parameter persistence, inspired by ImageJ/FIJI and adapted to Python workflows, saves and restores user configurations via lightweight YAML files, eliminating redundant input and producing shareable records that enhance reproducibility. EZInput supports diverse input types essential for scientific computing and it also includes built-in validation that ensures data integrity and clear feedback that reduces user friction.

*Samyak Jhaveri,Cristina V. Lopes*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper improves OpenACC pragma generation for GPUs by optimizing prompts to make smaller LLMs highly effective, achieving better compilation success rates and functional GPU speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity of generating effective GPU offloading pragmas and leverage LLMs for automated code generation without requiring resource-heavy model retraining.

Method: The authors developed a systematic prompt optimization framework, GEPA, that refines prompts using genetic algorithms and feedback loops based on Gold standards and mismatch analysis at the clause/parameter level.

Result: The optimized prompts led to significantly higher compilation success rates and improved GPU performance, especially for smaller and cost-effective LLMs such as GPT-4.1 Nano and GPT-5 Nano.

Conclusion: Prompt optimization can enable resource-efficient and highly effective use of smaller LLMs for parallel GPU code generation, paving the way for cost-efficient HPC workflows.

Abstract: OpenACC lowers the barrier to GPU offloading, but writing high-performing pragma remains complex, requiring deep domain expertise in memory hierarchies, data movement, and parallelization strategies. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising potential solution for automated parallel code generation, but naive prompting often results in syntactically incorrect directives, uncompilable code, or performance that fails to exceed CPU baselines. We present a systematic prompt optimization approach to enhance OpenACC pragma generation without the prohibitive computational costs associated with model post-training. Leveraging the GEPA (GEnetic-PAreto) framework, we iteratively evolve prompts through a reflective feedback loop. This process utilizes crossover and mutation of instructions, guided by expert-curated gold examples and structured feedback based on clause- and clause parameter-level mismatches between the gold and predicted pragma. In our evaluation on the PolyBench suite, we observe an increase in compilation success rates for programs annotated with OpenACC pragma generated using the optimized prompts compared to those annotated using the simpler initial prompt, particularly for the "nano"-scale models. Specifically, with optimized prompts, the compilation success rate for GPT-4.1 Nano surged from 66.7% to 93.3%, and for GPT-5 Nano improved from 86.7% to 100%, matching or surpassing the capabilities of their significantly larger, more expensive versions. Beyond compilation, the optimized prompts resulted in a 21% increase in the number of programs that achieve functional GPU speedups over CPU baselines. These results demonstrate that prompt optimization effectively unlocks the potential of smaller, cheaper LLMs in writing stable and effective GPU-offloading directives, establishing a cost-effective pathway to automated directive-based parallelization in HPC workflows.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper highlights vulnerabilities in build systems critical to software security and introduces a novel strategy called development phase isolation to detect poisoning in build automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: C code projects rely on build systems that are vulnerable to poisoning attacks, an untouched area by existing security techniques, despite their critical role in software supply chain security.

Method: The authors propose and prototype development phase isolation, which models permissions and behavior of build automation like program code, and implemented it in a tool called Foreman.

Result: Foreman detected poisoned test files from past attacks like the XZ Utils attack, demonstrating the practicality of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The study calls for the need to focus on build system security with tools like Foreman and envisions such checkers becoming as essential as program code checkers.

Abstract: Open source C code underpins society's computing infrastructure. Decades of work has helped harden C code against attackers, but C projects do not consist of only C code. C projects also contain build system code for automating development tasks like compilation, testing, and packaging. These build systems are critcal to software supply chain security and vulnerable to being poisoned, with the XZ Utils and SolarWinds attacks being recent examples. Existing techniques try to harden software supply chains by verifying software dependencies, but such methods ignore the build system itself. Similarly, classic software security checkers only analyze and monitor program code, not build system code. Moreover, poisoned build systems can easily circumvent tools for detecting program code vulnerabilities by disabling such checks. We present development phase isolation, a novel strategy for hardening build systems against poisoning by modeling the information and behavior permissions of build automation as if it were program code. We have prototyped this approach as a tool called Foreman, which successfully detects and warns about the poisoned test files involved in the XZ Utils attack. We outline our future plans to protect against pipeline poisoning by automatically checking development phase isolation. We envision a future where build system security checkers are as prevalent as program code checkers.

TL;DR: This study examines flaky test prevalence and causes in tests generated by LLMs for various database systems, finding slightly higher flakiness in generated tests compared to existing ones and suggesting possible mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the prevalence and causes of flaky tests from LLM-based test generation and how it impacts reliability in software testing across database systems.

Method: The researchers tested LLM-generated test suites (from GPT-4o and Mistral) in four databases (SAP HANA, DuckDB, MySQL, and SQLite). They manually inspected flaky tests and analyzed root causes by comparing generated tests to existing ones.

Result: Generated tests had slightly more flaky tests compared to existing ones. Most flakiness was due to reliance on unordered collections (63%), and flakiness transfer was more common in closed-source systems like SAP HANA.

Conclusion: LLM-generated test flakiness can affect software reliability. Developers should address flakiness sources and carefully tailor LLM contexts to reduce issues in test generation and improve outcomes.

Abstract: Flaky tests are a common problem in software testing. They produce inconsistent results when executed multiple times on the same code, invalidating the assumption that a test failure indicates a software defect. Recent work on LLM-based test generation has identified flakiness as a potential problem with generated tests. However, its prevalence and underlying causes are unclear. We examined the flakiness of LLM-generated tests in the context of four relational database management systems: SAP HANA, DuckDB, MySQL, and SQLite. We amplified test suites with two LLMs, GPT-4o and Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407, to assess the flakiness of the generated test cases. Our results suggest that generated tests have a slightly higher proportion of flaky tests compared to existing tests. Based on a manual inspection, we found that the most common root cause of flakiness was the reliance of a test on a certain order that is not guaranteed ("unordered collection"), which was present in 72 of 115 flaky tests (63%). Furthermore, both LLMs transferred the flakiness from the existing tests to the newly generated tests via the provided prompt context. Our experiments suggest that flakiness transfer is more prevalent in closed-source systems such as SAP HANA than in open-source systems. Our study informs developers on what types of flakiness to expect from LLM-generated tests. It also highlights the importance of providing LLMs with tailored context when employing LLMs for test generation.

*Dohyun Kim,Sanggu Han,Sangmin Woo,Joonha Jang,Jaehoon Kim,Changhun Song,Yongdae Kim*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces SafePlanner, a framework for detecting safety-critical flaws in Automated Driving Systems' planning models by generating meaningful test scenarios and identifying hazardous behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address safety challenges in Automated Driving Systems by creating a framework that identifies flaws in planning models, enhancing safety and robustness.

Method: SafePlanner uses structural analysis of the Plan model's code to generate feasible scene transitions and combines them with non-player vehicle behaviors. Guided fuzzing explores the Plan model's behavioral space during testing.

Result: SafePlanner generated 20,635 test cases, identified 520 hazardous behaviors (grouped into 15 root causes), and achieved high functional and decision coverage (83.63% and 63.22%) on Baidu Apollo's Plan model.

Conclusion: SafePlanner improves bug discovery, safety assurance, and efficiency in testing ADS Plan models, outperforming baseline methods, as demonstrated on Baidu Apollo ADS.

Abstract: In this work, we present SafePlanner, a systematic testing framework for identifying safety-critical flaws in the Plan model of Automated Driving Systems (ADS). SafePlanner targets two core challenges: generating structurally meaningful test scenarios and detecting hazardous planning behaviors. To maximize coverage, SafePlanner performs a structural analysis of the Plan model implementation - specifically, its scene-transition logic and hierarchical control flow - and uses this insight to extract feasible scene transitions from code. It then composes test scenarios by combining these transitions with non-player vehicle (NPC) behaviors. Guided fuzzing is applied to explore the behavioral space of the Plan model under these scenarios. We evaluate SafePlanner on Baidu Apollo, a production-grade level 4 ADS. It generates 20635 test cases and detects 520 hazardous behaviors, grouped into 15 root causes through manual analysis. For four of these, we applied patches based on our analysis; the issues disappeared, and no apparent side effects were observed. SafePlanner achieves 83.63 percent function and 63.22 percent decision coverage on the Plan model, outperforming baselines in both bug discovery and efficiency.

*Yi Gao,Xing Hu,Tongtong Xu,Jiali Zhao,Xiaohu Yang,Xin Xia*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces DepRadar, a framework for analyzing the impact of defects in deep learning libraries, achieving high precision and recall metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Downstream users face difficulty assessing whether defects in deep learning libraries affect their programs due to complex triggering conditions.

Method: DepRadar coordinates agents to extract defect semantics, synthesize them into unified patterns, and analyze downstream program impacts using domain-specific rules and tracing.

Result: DepRadar achieves 90% precision in defect identification and effectively analyzes client program impact with 90% recall and 80% precision.

Conclusion: DepRadar enhances defect analysis accuracy and explainability in library updates, outperforming existing solutions.

Abstract: Deep learning libraries like Transformers and Megatron are now widely adopted in modern AI programs. However, when these libraries introduce defects, ranging from silent computation errors to subtle performance regressions, it is often challenging for downstream users to assess whether their own programs are affected. Such impact analysis requires not only understanding the defect semantics but also checking whether the client code satisfies complex triggering conditions involving configuration flags, runtime environments, and indirect API usage. We present DepRadar, an agent coordination framework for fine grained defect and impact analysis in DL library updates. DepRadar coordinates four specialized agents across three steps: 1. the PR Miner and Code Diff Analyzer extract structured defect semantics from commits or pull requests, 2. the Orchestrator Agent synthesizes these signals into a unified defect pattern with trigger conditions, and 3. the Impact Analyzer checks downstream programs to determine whether the defect can be triggered. To improve accuracy and explainability, DepRadar integrates static analysis with DL-specific domain rules for defect reasoning and client side tracing. We evaluate DepRadar on 157 PRs and 70 commits across two representative DL libraries. It achieves 90% precision in defect identification and generates high quality structured fields (average field score 1.6). On 122 client programs, DepRadar identifies affected cases with 90% recall and 80% precision, substantially outperforming other baselines.

TL;DR: A metadata schema for energy research software is developed, improving FAIR principles adherence and tested for usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of domain-specific metadata schemas for research software in energy research.

Method: Developed a schema based on requirement analysis and evaluated it through user testing.

Result: The schema successfully balances formalization, interoperability, and energy researchers' specific needs.

Conclusion: Designing metadata schemas offers opportunities to enhance reusability and findability, and proper presentation aids researchers in creating metadata.

Abstract: Domain-specific metadata schemas are essential to improve the findability and reusability of research software and to follow the FAIR4RS principles. However, many domains, including energy research, lack established metadata schemas. To address this gap, we developed a metadata schema for energy research software based on a requirement analysis and evaluated it through user testing. Our results show that the schema balances the need for formalization and interoperability, while also meeting the specific needs of energy researchers. Meanwhile, the testing showed that a good presentation of the required information is key to enable researchers to create the required metadata. This paper provides insights into the challenges and opportunities of designing a metadata schema for energy research software.

TL;DR: Analysis of 25,173 issues and requests in nf-core pipelines identified 13 key challenges and examined resolution dynamics, offering insights into difficulties and management practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SWfMSs like Nextflow and nf-core pipelines are widely used but lack an understanding of user challenges in development and maintenance.

Method: An empirical study using BERTopic modeling, analyzing issues, pull requests, resolution dynamics, and statistical factors influencing success.

Result: 13 challenges identified including pipeline integration and CI management; 89.38% of issues resolved with labels and code snippets improving resolution.

Conclusion: The study provides insights on enhancing the usability, sustainability, and reproducibility of nf-core pipelines.

Abstract: Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWfMSs) such as Nextflow have become essential software frameworks for conducting reproducible, scalable, and portable computational analyses in data-intensive fields like genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. Building on Nextflow, the nf-core community curates standardized, peer-reviewed pipelines that follow strict testing, documentation, and governance guidelines. Despite its broad adoption, little is known about the challenges users face during the development and maintenance of these pipelines. This paper presents an empirical study of 25,173 issues and pull requests from these pipelines to uncover recurring challenges, management practices, and perceived difficulties. Using BERTopic modeling, we identify 13 key challenges, including pipeline development and integration, bug fixing, integrating genomic data, managing CI configurations, and handling version updates. We then examine issue resolution dynamics, showing that 89.38\% of issues and pull requests are eventually closed, with half resolved within three days. Statistical analysis reveals that the presence of labels (large effect, $δ$ = 0.94) and code snippets (medium effect, $δ$ = 0.50) significantly improve resolution likelihood. Further analysis reveals that tool development and repository maintenance poses the most significant challenges, followed by testing pipelines and CI configurations, and debugging containerized pipelines. Overall, this study provides actionable insights into the collaborative development and maintenance of nf-core pipelines, highlighting opportunities to enhance their usability, sustainability, and reproducibility.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SysPro is proposed to automate the reproduction of system-level concurrency bugs using bug reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reproducing non-deterministic, system-level concurrency bugs is difficult due to the lack of detailed bug information and tools capable of handling system call interleaving.

Method: SysPro uses system call extraction from bug reports, input generation, and dynamic source code instrumentation to reproduce bugs.

Result: Experiments on real-world benchmarks show SysPro's efficiency and effectiveness in reproducing system-level concurrency bugs.

Conclusion: SysPro resolves the challenge of automated bug reproduction by effectively extracting and utilizing bug-related details from natural language reports.

Abstract: Reproducing system-level concurrency bugs requires both input data and the precise interleaving order of system calls. This process is challenging because such bugs are non-deterministic, and bug reports often lack the detailed information needed. Additionally, the unstructured nature of reports written in natural language makes it difficult to extract necessary details. Existing tools are inadequate to reproduce these bugs due to their inability to manage the specific interleaving at the system call level. To address these challenges, we propose SysPro, a novel approach that automatically extracts relevant system call names from bug reports and identifies their locations in the source code. It generates input data by utilizing information retrieval, regular expression matching, and the category-partition method. This extracted input and interleaving data are then used to reproduce bugs through dynamic source code instrumentation. Our empirical study on real-world benchmarks demonstrates that SysPro is both effective and efficient at localizing and reproducing system-level concurrency bugs from bug reports.

*Michael Konstantinou,Renzo Degiovanni,Mike Papadakis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Research evaluates state-of-the-art LLM-based test generation tools and finds newer LLM versions outperform previous techniques in effectiveness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of recent LLM advancements against traditional and engineered test generation methods, questioning the need for post-processing techniques.

Method: Replicated four LLM-based test generation tools, integrated updated LLM versions, and ran experiments on 393 classes and 3,657 methods, comparing results with plain LLM test generation.

Result: The plain LLM surpassed engineered tools in effectiveness metrics: line coverage (+17.72%), branch coverage (+19.80%), and mutation score (+20.92%), with comparable computational costs.

Conclusion: Stronger LLMs can outperform previously engineered methods in unit test generation; optimizing LLM application granularity reduces costs while maintaining effectiveness.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has strongly impacted software engineering, leading to a growing number of studies on automated unit test generation. However, the standalone use of LLMs without post-processing has proven insufficient, often producing tests that fail to compile or achieve high coverage. Several techniques have been proposed to address these issues, reporting improvements in test compilation and coverage. While important, LLM-based test generation techniques have been evaluated against relatively weak baselines (for todays' standards), i.e., old LLM versions and relatively weak prompts, which may exacerbate the performance contribution of the approaches. In other words, stronger (newer) LLMs may obviate any advantage these techniques bring. We investigate this issue by replicating four state-of-the-art LLM-based test generation tools, HITS, SymPrompt, TestSpark, and CoverUp that include engineering components aimed at guiding the test generation process through compilation and execution feedback, and evaluate their relative effectiveness and efficiency over a plain LLM test generation method. We integrate current LLM versions in all approaches and run an experiment on 393 classes and 3,657 methods. Our results show that the plain LLM approach can outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches in all test effectiveness metrics we used: line coverage (by 17.72%), branch coverage (by 19.80%) and mutation score (by 20.92%), and it does so at a comparable cost (LLM queries). We also observe that the granularity at which the plain LLM is applied has a significant impact on the cost. We therefore propose targeting first the program classes, where test generation is more efficient, and then the uncovered methods to reduce the number of LLM requests. This strategy achieves comparable (slightly higher) effectiveness while requiring about 20% fewer LLM requests.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ShortCoder reduces tokens in code generation tasks and improves generation efficiency using syntax-level simplifications and LLM fine-tuning, ensuring semantic consistency and readability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating code generation can save time and improve productivity, but current LLM-based methods face efficiency issues due to resource-intensive token generation processes.

Method: ShortCoder introduces ten syntax-level simplification rules, a hybrid data synthesis pipeline for creating a simplified code corpus, and fine-tuning strategies to enhance conciseness in LLM-based code generation.

Result: ShortCoder achieves 18.1%-37.8% higher efficiency in code generation on the HumanEval benchmark compared to existing methods, while maintaining semantic equivalence and functional correctness.

Conclusion: ShortCoder successfully enhances the efficiency of code generation processes, addressing architectural constraints in LLMs without compromising code functionality or readability.

Abstract: Code generation tasks aim to automate the conversion of user requirements into executable code, significantly reducing manual development efforts and enhancing software productivity. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code generation, though their efficiency is still impacted by certain inherent architectural constraints. Each token generation necessitates a complete inference pass, requiring persistent retention of contextual information in memory and escalating resource consumption. While existing research prioritizes inference-phase optimizations such as prompt compression and model quantization, the generation phase remains underexplored. To tackle these challenges, we propose a knowledge-infused framework named ShortCoder, which optimizes code generation efficiency while preserving semantic equivalence and readability. In particular, we introduce: (1) ten syntax-level simplification rules for Python, derived from AST-preserving transformations, achieving 18.1% token reduction without functional compromise; (2) a hybrid data synthesis pipeline integrating rule-based rewriting with LLM-guided refinement, producing ShorterCodeBench, a corpus of validated tuples of original code and simplified code with semantic consistency; (3) a fine-tuning strategy that injects conciseness awareness into the base LLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ShortCoder consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on HumanEval, achieving an improvement of 18.1%-37.8% in generation efficiency over previous methods while ensuring the performance of code generation.

*William Dorrell,Peter E. Latham*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper explores the structured connectivity of cerebellar-like networks and its effect on learning, proposing an analytical model linking connectivity and circuit learning ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates the structured connectivity observed in cerebellar-like networks and its potential to prioritize learning for natural tasks, challenging the traditional view of random projections in these networks.

Method: The authors extend a kernel regression model and use machine learning theory to analytically link connectivity patterns with the networks learning ability.

Result: The structured connectivity in the network's projection weights influences inductive biases, such as easier learning of functions relying on oversampled inputs or specific neuron collections.

Conclusion: Structured connectivity plays a significant role in shaping learning abilities in cerebellar-like networks, offering a model to further explore similar neural systems.

Abstract: Cerebellar-like networks, in which input activity patterns are separated by projection to a much higher-dimensional space before classification, are a recurring neurobiological motif, present in the cerebellum, dentate gyrus, insect olfactory system, and electrosensory system of the electric fish. Their relatively well-understood design presents a promising test-case for probing principles of biological learning. The circuits' expansive projections have long been modelled as random, enabling effective general purpose pattern separation. However, electron-microscopy studies have discovered interesting hints of structure in both the fly mushroom body and mouse cerebellum. Recent numerical work suggested that this non-random connectivity enables the circuit to prioritise learning of some, presumably natural, tasks over others. Here, rather than numerical results, we present a robust mathematical link between the observed connectivity patterns and the cerebellar circuit's learning ability. In particular, we extend a simplified kernel regression model of the system and use recent machine learning theory results to relate connectivity to learning. We find that the reported structure in the projection weights shapes the network's inductive bias in intuitive ways: functions are easier to learn if they depend on inputs that are oversampled, or on collections of neurons that tend to connect to the same hidden layer neurons. Our approach is analytically tractable and pleasingly simple, and we hope it continues to serve as a model for understanding the functional implications of other processing motifs in cerebellar-like networks.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to upgrade convergence guarantees of unadjusted Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (uHMC) to tail-sensitive divergences like KL and Rényi. This aids in understanding the behavior of acceptance probabilities and warm-start requirements in sampling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited understanding of convergence properties of HMC algorithms when measured under KL and Rényi divergences, which naturally influence key aspects of Metropolis-adjusted methods.

Method: The authors employ one-shot couplings to establish a regularization property of uHMC transition kernels, enabling the extension of Wasserstein convergence bounds to KL and Rényi divergences.

Result: The study achieves improved quantitative control over relative density mismatch, clarifies discretization bias in strong divergences, and guarantees relevant for both unadjusted sampling and warm-start generation for adjusted methods.

Conclusion: The findings provide deeper insight into uHMC behavior in high-dimensional settings, enhance theoretical guarantees in divergences important for practical applications, and bridge gaps in understanding convergence properties of sampling algorithms.

Abstract: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithms are among the most widely used sampling methods in high dimensional settings, yet their convergence properties are poorly understood in divergences that quantify relative density mismatch, such as Kullback-Leibler (KL) and Rényi divergences. These divergences naturally govern acceptance probabilities and warm-start requirements for Metropolis-adjusted Markov chains. In this work, we develop a framework for upgrading Wasserstein convergence guarantees for unadjusted Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (uHMC) to guarantees in tail-sensitive KL and Rényi divergences. Our approach is based on one-shot couplings, which we use to establish a regularization property of the uHMC transition kernel. This regularization allows Wasserstein-2 mixing-time and asymptotic bias bounds to be lifted to KL divergence, and analogous Orlicz-Wasserstein bounds to be lifted to Rényi divergence, paralleling earlier work of Bou-Rabee and Eberle (2023) that upgrade Wasserstein-1 bounds to total variation distance via kernel smoothing. As a consequence, our results provide quantitative control of relative density mismatch, clarify the role of discretization bias in strong divergences, and yield principled guarantees relevant both for unadjusted sampling and for generating warm starts for Metropolis-adjusted Markov chains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address sparsity in expert utilization in mixture-of-experts architectures and link it to large-scale language models that face extreme constraints on activating a limited number of experts.

Method: The authors propose combining the adaptive global-local shrinkage of the horseshoe prior with input-dependent gating mechanisms, alongside developing a particle learning algorithm for sequential inference leveraging sufficient statistics.

Result: The introduction of HS-MoE models facilitates data-adaptive sparsity and provides a robust, efficient approach to expert selection under extreme constraints.

Conclusion: HS-MoE models effectively balance sparsity and performance in mixture-of-experts frameworks, offering practical relevance to large language models and advancing sequential inference techniques.

Abstract: Horseshoe mixtures-of-experts (HS-MoE) models provide a Bayesian framework for sparse expert selection in mixture-of-experts architectures. We combine the horseshoe prior's adaptive global-local shrinkage with input-dependent gating, yielding data-adaptive sparsity in expert usage. Our primary methodological contribution is a particle learning algorithm for sequential inference, in which the filter is propagated forward in time while tracking only sufficient statistics. We also discuss how HS-MoE relates to modern mixture-of-experts layers in large language models, which are deployed under extreme sparsity constraints (e.g., activating a small number of experts per token out of a large pool).

TL;DR: This paper introduces a machine-learning framework for high-throughput creep law identification using a dimple array bulge instrument, enabling efficient creep testing and analysis of multiple alloys simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for high-temperature creep characterization are inefficient and limit rapid exploration of alloy compositions for structural applications.

Method: The study uses a combination of a dimple array bulge instrument (DABI), 3D digital image correlation, recurrent neural networks (RNN), and particle swarm optimization to identify creep parameters in parallel for multiple alloys.

Result: The framework successfully identifies creep laws for various alloy compositions, introduces phenomenological laws for sigmoidal primary creep, and provides temperature-dependent behaviors across Fe-, Ni-, and Co-rich alloys.

Conclusion: This approach offers a robust, high-throughput platform for rapid creep characterization and material discovery, aiding in alloy design, data mining, and structural optimization.

Abstract: Hihg-temperature creep characterization of structural alloys traditionally relies on serial uniaxial tests, which are highly inefficient for exploring the large search space of alloy compositions and for material discovery. Here, we introduce a machine-learning-assisted, high-throughput framework for creep law identification based on a dimple array bulge instrument (DABI) configuration, which enables parallel creep testing of 25 dimples, each fabricated from a different alloy, in a single experiment. Full-field surface displacements of dimples undergoing time-dependent creep-induced bulging under inert gas pressure are measured by 3D digital image correlation. We train a recurrent neural network (RNN) as a surrogate model, mapping creep parameters and loading conditions to the time-dependent deformation response of DABI. Coupling this surrogate with a particle swarm optimization scheme enables rapid and global inverse identification with sparsity regularization of creep parameters from experiment displacement-time histories. In addition, we propose a phenomenological creep law with a time-dependent stress exponent that captures the sigmoidal primary creep observed in wrought INCONEL 625 and extracts its temperature dependence from DABI test at multiple temperatures. Furthermore, we employ a general creep law combining several conventional forms together with regularized inversion to identify the creep laws for 47 additional Fe-, Ni-, and Co-rich alloys and to automatically select the dominant functional form for each alloy. This workflow combined with DABI experiment provides a quantitative, high-throughput creep characterization platform that is compatible with data mining, composition-property modeling, and nonlinear structural optimization with creep behavior across a large alloy design space.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive, intelligent framework for real-time data filtering in high-throughput scientific experiments, optimizing performance dynamically instead of relying on static, hand-tuned criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional trigger systems rely on static, heuristic designs to handle high-rate data streams, which are inefficient given evolving conditions and new data challenges in advanced scientific facilities such as LHC.

Method: The study introduces a benchmarking ecosystem for emulating realistic collider conditions and employs dynamic optimization of trigger menus through machine-learning-based anomaly-detection algorithms.

Result: Using simulated and CMS collision data, the framework successfully demonstrates the ability to autonomously optimize trigger performance under defined cost metrics without manual intervention.

Conclusion: This intelligent, adaptive trigger system represents a shift from static designs to automated, data-driven control, enhancing flexibility and the potential for new discoveries in high-energy physics.

Abstract: Real-time data filtering and selection -- or trigger -- systems at high-throughput scientific facilities such as the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) must process extremely high-rate data streams under stringent bandwidth, latency, and storage constraints. Yet these systems are typically designed as static, hand-tuned menus of selection criteria grounded in prior knowledge and simulation. In this work, we further explore the concept of a self-driving trigger, an autonomous data-filtering framework that reallocates resources and adjusts thresholds dynamically in real-time to optimize signal efficiency, rate stability, and computational cost as instrumentation and environmental conditions evolve. We introduce a benchmark ecosystem to emulate realistic collider scenarios and demonstrate real-time optimization of a menu including canonical energy sum triggers as well as modern anomaly-detection algorithms that target non-standard event topologies using machine learning. Using simulated data streams and publicly available collision data from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, we demonstrate the capability to dynamically and automatically optimize trigger performance under specific cost objectives without manual retuning. Our adaptive strategy shifts trigger design from static menus with heuristic tuning to intelligent, automated, data-driven control, unlocking greater flexibility and discovery potential in future high-energy physics analyses.

*Hao Chen,Philipp Gläser,Konrad Willner,Jürgen Oberst*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: This paper introduces an enhanced deep learning model for reconstructing fine-scale lunar topography, including polar regions under challenging illumination conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meter-scale topographic data for planetary surfaces, specifically the Moon, are scarce, limiting detailed geological studies despite high-resolution images being available.

Method: A deep learning framework is refined with improved scale recovery and extended to polar regions under low solar illumination, comparing its performance against single-view shape-from-shading techniques.

Result: The approach demonstrates robustness to varying illumination, accurately reconstructs diverse lunar terrains, and successfully models topography in complex, shaded polar regions.

Conclusion: Deep learning methods can utilize lunar datasets to create detailed topographic models, offering tools to support upcoming exploration missions and advanced geological research.

Abstract: Topographic models are essential for characterizing planetary surfaces and for inferring underlying geological processes. Nevertheless, meter-scale topographic data remain limited, which constrains detailed planetary investigations, even for the Moon, where extensive high-resolution orbital images are available. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) exploit single-view imagery, constrained by low-resolution topography, for fast and flexible reconstruction of fine-scale topography. However, their robustness and general applicability across diverse lunar landforms and illumination conditions remain insufficiently explored. In this study, we build upon our previously proposed DL framework by incorporating a more robust scale recovery scheme and extending the model to polar regions under low solar illumination conditions. We demonstrate that, compared with single-view shape-from-shading methods, the proposed DL approach exhibits greater robustness to varying illumination and achieves more consistent and accurate topographic reconstructions. Furthermore, it reliably reconstructs topography across lunar features of diverse scales, morphologies, and geological ages. High-quality topographic models are also produced for the lunar south polar areas, including permanently shadowed regions, demonstrating the method's capability in reconstructing complex and low-illumination terrain. These findings suggest that DL-based approaches have the potential to leverage extensive lunar datasets to support advanced exploration missions and enable investigations of the Moon at unprecedented topographic resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how personalized feedback using different formats can effectively support physics learning, amidst the rise of multimodal AI tools.

Method: A 16-24 week observational study with 661 students employed a computer-based platform providing verification and optional elaborated feedback in verbal, graphical, and mathematical forms. Analyses included linear mixed-effects models and strategy-cluster comparisons.

Result: Elaborated multirepresentational feedback showed consistent positive associations with post-test scores, independent of prior knowledge or confidence. Representation-selection strategies and learning outcomes varied by student representational competence.

Conclusion: Adaptive feedback designs tailored to learner profiles may improve physics education by leveraging diverse representational formats and personalized strategies, benefiting intelligent tutoring systems.

Abstract: Multiple external representations (MERs) and personalized feedback support physics learning, yet evidence on how personalized feedback can effectively integrate MERs remains limited. This question is particularly timely given the emergence of multimodal large language models. We conducted a 16-24 week observational study in high school physics (N=661) using a computer-based platform that provided verification and optional elaborated feedback in verbal, graphical and mathematical forms. Linear mixed-effects models and strategy-cluster analyses (ANCOVA-adjusted comparisons) tested associations between feedback use and post-test performance and moderation by representational competence. Elaborated multirepresentational feedback showed a small but consistent positive association with post-test scores independent of prior knowledge and confidence. Learners adopted distinct representation-selection strategies; among students with lower representational competence, using a diverse set of representations related to higher learning, whereas this advantage diminished as competence increased. These findings motivate adaptive feedback designs and inform intelligent tutoring systems capable of tailoring feedback elaboration and representational format to learner profiles, advancing personalized instruction in physics education.

### [286] [Evolutionary tuning of TAM receptor-ligand interfaces highlights electrostatic features associated with regenerative phagocytic signaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08855)
*Enso O. Torres Alegre*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The study explores the evolutionary and structural characteristics of TAM receptors and ligands in zebrafish, humans, and mice, emphasizing conserved and optimized electrostatic interfaces that may enhance regenerative efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why regenerative vertebrates like zebrafish exhibit faster immune resolution and debris clearance compared to mammals, focusing on the role of TAM receptor-ligand complexes in phagocytic regulation.

Method: Conducted in silico analyses integrating sequence evolution, structural modeling, interface characterization, and electrostatic studies of TAM receptors and ligands across species.

Result: Found structural conservation across species but enhanced electrostatic contributions and higher salt-bridge density in zebrafish, suggesting optimization in the Tyro3-Protein S interaction.

Conclusion: TAM receptor-ligand interfaces are highly conserved but evolutionarily refined through electrostatic properties, providing a framework for species-specific immune resolution and regeneration.

Abstract: Efficient resolution of neuroinflammation and debris clearance is a key determinant of successful central nervous system regeneration. Regenerative vertebrates such as Danio rerio often exhibit faster immune resolution and debris clearance than mammals, yet the molecular determinants underlying these differences remain incompletely understood. TAM receptor tyrosine kinases (Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk) and their ligands Gas6 and Protein S are central regulators of phagocytosis and immune resolution in the nervous system, but whether intrinsic structural properties of these receptor-ligand complexes contribute to regenerative efficiency has not been systematically explored.
  Here, we present a comparative in silico analysis of TAM receptors and ligands from zebrafish, human, and mouse, integrating sequence evolution, high-confidence structural modeling, interface characterization, and electrostatic analysis. Despite substantial sequence divergence, ligand-binding domains display strong structural conservation, supporting a conserved global mode of TAM-ligand engagement. At the interface level, zebrafish complexes show enhanced electrostatic contributions and increased salt-bridge density, particularly in the Tyro3-Protein S interaction. Residue-level electrostatic analysis reveals clustered interface hotspots that are spatially conserved across species despite evolutionary rewiring of individual contacts.
  Together, these results suggest that TAM receptor-ligand interfaces are evolutionarily tuned through subtle electrostatic and geometric optimization rather than large-scale structural changes, providing a conserved yet adaptable framework for species-specific modulation of phagocytic signaling.

*Renqiang Luo,Huafei Huang,Tao Tang,Jing Ren,Ziqi Xu,Mingliang Hou,Enyan Dai,Feng Xia*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: FairGE is a fairness-aware framework for Graph Transformers in handling incomplete social network data without reconstructing sensitive attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses fairness concerns in Graph Transformers applied to incomplete social networks, where missing sensitive attributes pose privacy and ethical challenges.

Method: The authors introduce FairGE, which utilizes spectral graph theory by encoding fairness through the principal eigenvector while padding incomplete sensitive attributes with zeros, avoiding attribute reconstruction.

Result: FairGE improves statistical parity and equality of opportunity by at least 16% over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrated through experiments on seven social network datasets.

Conclusion: FairGE ensures fairness in incomplete social networks without generating sensitive attributes, proving to be an effective solution to the fairness challenges in social network analysis using Graph Transformers.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) are increasingly applied to social network analysis, yet their deployment is often constrained by fairness concerns. This issue is particularly critical in incomplete social networks, where sensitive attributes are frequently missing due to privacy and ethical restrictions. Existing solutions commonly generate these incomplete attributes, which may introduce additional biases and further compromise user privacy. To address this challenge, FairGE (Fair Graph Encoding) is introduced as a fairness-aware framework for GTs in incomplete social networks. Instead of generating sensitive attributes, FairGE encodes fairness directly through spectral graph theory. By leveraging the principal eigenvector to represent structural information and padding incomplete sensitive attributes with zeros to maintain independence, FairGE ensures fairness without data reconstruction. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the method suppresses the influence of non-principal spectral components, thereby enhancing fairness. Extensive experiments on seven real-world social network datasets confirm that FairGE achieves at least a 16% improvement in both statistical parity and equality of opportunity compared with state-of-the-art baselines. The source code is shown in https://github.com/LuoRenqiang/FairGE.

*Jiahao Tian,Hugh Chipman,Thomas Loughin*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper presents MLCBART, a Bayesian nonparametric model for multilabel classification (MLC) that models label correlations and improves prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of simultaneously classifying multiple binary labels, accounting for both complex relationships with predictors and interdependencies among labels.

Method: Developed MLCBART, an adaptation of Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), using a multivariate normal model for label correlations and introducing probabilistic methods like MCMC for deeper insights.

Result: The model outperforms traditional approaches in predicting multilabel vectors, demonstrating accuracy close to that of an oracle model.

Conclusion: MLCBART captures label dependencies, enhances predictive performance, and provides uncertainty quantification, offering valuable insights in multi-label classification settings.

Abstract: Multilabel Classification (MLC) deals with the simultaneous classification of multiple binary labels. The task is challenging because, not only may there be arbitrarily different and complex relationships between predictor variables and each label, but associations among labels may exist even after accounting for effects of predictor variables. In this paper, we present a Bayesian additive regression tree (BART) framework to model the problem. BART is a nonparametric and flexible model structure capable of uncovering complex relationships within the data. Our adaptation, MLCBART, assumes that labels arise from thresholding an underlying numeric scale, where a multivariate normal model allows explicit estimation of the correlation structure among labels. This enables the discovery of complicated relationships in various forms and improves MLC predictive performance. Our Bayesian framework not only enables uncertainty quantification for each predicted label, but our MCMC draws produce an estimated conditional probability distribution of label combinations for any predictor values. Simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model by comparing its performance with a set of models, including the oracle model with the correct functional form. Results show that our model predicts vectors of labels more accurately than other contenders and its performance is close to the oracle model. An example highlights how the method's ability to produce measures of uncertainty on predictions provides nuanced understanding of classification results.

### [289] [LARGE: A Locally Adaptive Regularization Approach for Estimating Gaussian Graphical Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09686)
*Ha Nguyen,Sumanta Basu*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces LARGE, a method improving graph estimation by adaptively learning node-specific tuning parameters for the graphical Lasso algorithm, outperforming other methods in accuracy and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for learning the regularization parameter in graphical Lasso fail to account for heterogeneity in variable scaling and partial variances, posing a challenge for graph estimation in high-dimensional settings like brain network analysis.

Method: LARGE augments the graphical Lasso by incorporating nodewise Lasso regression in each step to jointly estimate regression coefficients and error variance, enabling adaptive learning of penalties for each node.

Result: The proposed method outperforms standard techniques in simulations, showing better graph recovery, greater stability, and improved accuracy, even in challenging conditions. It demonstrates effectiveness on real-world fMRI datasets.

Conclusion: LARGE enhances graphical model estimation, offering a more adaptive approach for applications requiring precision, such as neuroscience, by overcoming limitations of global regularization parameters.

Abstract: The graphical Lasso (GLASSO) is a widely used algorithm for learning high-dimensional undirected Gaussian graphical models (GGM). Given i.i.d. observations from a multivariate normal distribution, GLASSO estimates the precision matrix by maximizing the log-likelihood with an \ell_1-penalty on the off-diagonal entries. However, selecting an optimal regularization parameter λin this unsupervised setting remains a significant challenge. A well-known issue is that existing methods, such as out-of-sample likelihood maximization, select a single global λand do not account for heterogeneity in variable scaling or partial variances. Standardizing the data to unit variances, although a common workaround, has been shown to negatively affect graph recovery. Addressing the problem of nodewise adaptive tuning in graph estimation is crucial for applications like computational neuroscience, where brain networks are constructed from highly heterogeneous, region-specific fMRI data.
  In this work, we develop Locally Adaptive Regularization for Graph Estimation (LARGE), an approach to adaptively learn nodewise tuning parameters to improve graph estimation and selection. In each block coordinate descent step of GLASSO, we augment the nodewise Lasso regression to jointly estimate the regression coefficients and error variance, which in turn guides the adaptive learning of nodewise penalties. In simulations, LARGE consistently outperforms benchmark methods in graph recovery, demonstrates greater stability across replications, and achieves the best estimation accuracy in the most difficult simulation settings. We demonstrate the practical utility of our method by estimating brain functional connectivity from a real fMRI data set.

### [290] [Residual Power Flow for Neural Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09533)
*Jochen Stiasny,Jochen Cremer*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Residual Power Flow (RPF) formulation for energy system optimization, aiming to combine the speed of neural solvers with flexibility to adapt to changing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The energy transition presents growing computational challenges as the power grid expands and variable renewable energy requires flexible and fast operational solutions. Existing neural solvers are fast but not adaptable to diverse tasks, limiting their practical usability.

Method: The work proposes the RPF approach, which uses residual functions derived from Kirchhoff’s laws to address AC-feasibility in power system simulations. It integrates neural solvers trained with RPF and follows a Predict-then-Optimise (PO) approach to achieve flexibility and speed.

Result: The approach was validated on the IEEE 9-bus system across tasks such as AC Optimal Power Flow, power-flow analysis, and quasi-steady state power flow, showing improved accuracy and flexibility compared to common methods.

Conclusion: RPF-enhanced neural solvers provide a foundational and reusable solution for energy system optimization, offering both adaptability and computational efficiency.

Abstract: The energy transition challenges operational tasks based on simulations and optimisation. These computations need to be fast and flexible as the grid is ever-expanding, and renewables' uncertainty requires a flexible operational environment. Learned approximations, proxies or surrogates -- we refer to them as Neural Solvers -- excel in terms of evaluation speed, but are inflexible with respect to adjusting to changing tasks. Hence, neural solvers are usually applicable to highly specific tasks, which limits their usefulness in practice; a widely reusable, foundational neural solver is required. Therefore, this work proposes the Residual Power Flow (RPF) formulation. RPF formulates residual functions based on Kirchhoff's laws to quantify the infeasibility of an operating condition. The minimisation of the residuals determines the voltage solution; an additional slack variable is needed to achieve AC-feasibility. RPF forms a natural, foundational subtask of tasks subject to power flow constraints. We propose to learn RPF with neural solvers to exploit their speed. Furthermore, RPF improves learning performance compared to common power flow formulations. To solve operational tasks, we integrate the neural solver in a Predict-then-Optimise (PO) approach to combine speed and flexibility. The case study investigates the IEEE 9-bus system and three tasks (AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF), power-flow and quasi-steady state power flow) solved by PO. The results demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of learning with RPF.

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: This paper proposes a scalable, efficient probabilistic computing approach for solving dense combinatorial optimization problems, focused on wireless communication applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scalability issues of dense connectivity in probabilistic computing hardware for real-world combinatorial optimization problems, such as MIMO detection in wireless communication.

Method: Introduced graph sparsification with auxiliary variables combined with a fully on-chip parallel tempering solver. Multiple temperature and constraint replicas were implemented to speed up convergence, utilizing Two-Dimensional Parallel Tempering.

Result: Achieved faster solutions for MIMO detection with bit error rates lower than conventional approaches. Demonstrated complete, on-chip end-to-end solution times of 4.7ms per instance with ASIC projections indicating efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: Proposed a scalable on-chip p-bit architecture and algorithmic framework for dense combinatorial optimization, showcasing significant potential for next-gen wireless system applications through massive parallelism.

Abstract: Probabilistic computers built from p-bits offer a promising path for combinatorial optimization, but the dense connectivity required by real-world problems scales poorly in hardware. Here, we address this through graph sparsification with auxiliary copy variables and demonstrate a fully on-chip parallel tempering solver on an FPGA. Targeting MIMO detection, a dense, NP-hard problem central to wireless communications, we fit 15 temperature replicas of a 128-node sparsified system (1,920 p-bits) entirely on-chip and achieve bit error rates significantly below conventional linear detectors. We report complete end-to-end solution times of 4.7 ms per instance, with all loading, sampling, readout, and verification overheads included. ASIC projections in 7 nm technology indicate about 90 MHz operation with less than 200 mW power dissipation, suggesting that massive parallelism across multiple chips could approach the throughput demands of next-generation wireless systems. However, sparsification introduces sensitivity to the copy-constraint strength. Employing Two-Dimensional Parallel Tempering (2D-PT), which exchanges replicas across both temperature and constraint dimensions, we demonstrate over 10X faster convergence without manual parameter tuning. These results establish an on-chip p-bit architecture and a scalable algorithmic framework for dense combinatorial optimization.

*Leandro Farias Maia*

TL;DR: This dissertation introduces new algorithms for large-scale optimization: a proximal ADMM adapted to inexact solutions and two novel BCD methods. It demonstrates practical efficiency and state-of-the-art convergence results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in solving large-scale optimization problems using block decomposable methods like ADMM and BCD, particularly focusing on adaptiveness, computational efficiency, and convergence guarantees.

Method: Proposed a proximal ADMM algorithm that solves subproblems inexactly and developed two BCD methods with inexact proximal mappings and convergence guarantees for Hölder smooth functions.

Result: The proposed algorithms achieve state-of-the-art complexity and convergence rates. Numerical results show superior performance of dynamic error-regime methods.

Conclusion: The dissertation provides practical and theoretical advancements in block decomposable methods for optimization, ensuring improved adaptiveness, efficiency, and robustness in solving large-scale problems.

Abstract: This dissertation explores block decomposable methods for large-scale optimization problems. It focuses on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) schemes and block coordinate descent (BCD) methods. Specifically, it introduces a new proximal ADMM algorithm and proposes two BCD methods. The first part of the research presents a new proximal ADMM algorithm. This method is adaptive to all problem parameters and solves the proximal augmented Lagrangian (AL) subproblem inexactly. This adaptiveness facilitates the highly efficient application of the algorithm to a broad swath of practical problems. The inexact solution of the proximal AL subproblem overcomes many key challenges in the practical applications of ADMM. The resultant algorithm obtains an approximate solution of an optimization problem in a number of iterations that matches the state-of-the-art complexity for the class of proximal ADMM schemes. The second part of the research focuses on an inexact proximal mapping for the class of block proximal gradient methods. Key properties of this operator is established, facilitating the derivation of convergence rates for the proposed algorithm. Under two error decreases conditions, the algorithm matches the convergence rate of its exactly computed counterpart. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the algorithm under a dynamic error regime over a fixed one. The dissertation concludes by providing convergence guarantees for the randomized BCD method applied to a broad class of functions, known as Hölder smooth functions. Convergence rates are derived for non-convex, convex, and strongly convex functions. These convergence rates match those furnished in the existing literature for the Lipschtiz smooth setting.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper extends a trust-region method for optimizing functions combining smooth nonconvex and nonsmooth convex terms by introducing an inexact proximity operator and applying it to a Burgers' equation-constrained optimal control problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of standard proximity operator assumptions in trust-region methods by extending its inexact applications to include broader nonsmooth functions.

Method: The authors define an inexact proximity operator using the δ-Fréchet subdifferential, adjust the trust-region convergence analysis, and design an algorithm to compute inexact proximity points.

Result: The proposed method is tested within a trust-region framework, solving an optimal control problem constrained by Burgers’ equation, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: Extending the use of proximity operators allows broader problems to be tackled within trust-region methods, showing promising theoretical and practical results.

Abstract: In [R. J. Baraldi and D. P. Kouri, Math. Program., 201:1 (2023), pp. 559-598], the authors introduced a trust-region method for minimizing the sum of a smooth nonconvex and a nonsmooth convex function, the latter of which has an analytical proximity operator. While many functions satisfy this criterion, e.g., the $\ell_1$-norm defined on $\ell_2$, many others are precluded by either the topology or the nature of the nonsmooth term. Using the $δ$-Fréchet subdifferential, we extend the definition of the inexact proximity operator and enable its use within the aforementioned trust-region algorithm. Moreover, we augment the analysis for the standard trust-region convergence theory to handle proximity operator inexactness with weighted inner products. We first introduce an algorithm to generate a point in the inexact proximity operator and then apply the algorithm within the trust-region method to solve an optimal control problem constrained by Burgers' equation.

*Generoso Immediato*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This work disproves a conjectured trade-off between epistemic certainty and scope in artificial intelligence, showing no universal certainty-scope hyperbolic relationship exists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate and disprove a conjecture suggesting an inherent trade-off between certainty and scope in AI, a concept with implications for understanding limitations in AI systems.

Method: It uses principles from coding theory and algorithmic information theory to analyze the conjecture, identifying inconsistencies when using prefix Kolmogorov complexity and providing a counterexample using plain Kolmogorov complexity.

Result: The study demonstrates that the conjectured certainty-scope hyperbola is internally inconsistent under specific definitions and false with a counterexample under others.

Conclusion: The conjecture regarding a universal certainty-scope trade-off in AI is invalidated, establishing that no such universal bound exists under the proposed definitions.

Abstract: We formally disprove a recently conjectured artificial intelligence trade-off between epistemic certainty and scope in the universal hyperbolic product form in which it was published. Certainty is defined as the worst-case correctness probability over the input space, and scope as the sum of the Kolmogorov complexities of the input and output sets. Using standard facts from coding theory and algorithmic information theory, we show, first, that when the conjecture is instantiated with prefix (self-delimiting, prefix-free) Kolmogorov complexity, it leads to an internal inconsistency, and second, that when it is instantiated with plain Kolmogorov complexity, it is refuted by a constructive counterexample. These results establish a general theorem: contrary to the conjecture's claim, no universal "certainty-scope" hyperbola holds as a general bound under the published definitions.

### [295] [The Inconsistency Critique: Epistemic Practices and AI Testimony About Inner States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08850)
*Gerol Petruzella*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper critiques the inconsistency in how we handle AI testimony, particularly about their inner states, calling for epistemological scrutiny.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the inconsistent treatment of AI testimony across domains and argue for a principled epistemological approach.

Method: Utilizes the inconsistency critique, referencing Fricker's epistemological distinctions and Goldberg's obligations to speakers to analyze testimonial practices.

Result: Identifies prejudgment rather than reasoned caution in dismissing AI claims about inner states, reflecting problematic testimonial practices.

Conclusion: Calls for improved 'epistemological hygiene' to ensure consistent, adaptive practices in evaluating AI testimony about moral status.

Abstract: The question of whether AI systems have morally relevant interests -- the 'model welfare' question -- depends in part on how we evaluate AI testimony about inner states. This paper develops what I call the inconsistency critique: independent of whether skepticism about AI testimony is ultimately justified, our actual epistemic practices regarding such testimony exhibit internal inconsistencies that lack principled grounds. We functionally treat AI outputs as testimony across many domains -- evaluating them for truth, challenging them, accepting corrections, citing them as sources -- while categorically dismissing them in a specific domain, namely, claims about inner states. Drawing on Fricker's distinction between treating a speaker as an 'informant' versus a 'mere source,' the framework of testimonial injustice, and Goldberg's obligation-based account of what we owe speakers, I argue that this selective withdrawal of testimonial standing exhibits the epistemically problematic structure of prejudgment rather than principled caution. The inconsistency critique does not require taking a position on whether AI systems have morally relevant properties; rather, it is a contribution to what we may call 'epistemological hygiene' -- examining the structure of our inquiry before evaluating its conclusions. Even if our practices happen to land on correct verdicts about AI moral status, they do so for reasons that cannot adapt to new evidence or changing circumstances.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper deals with ethical concerns in AI research, particularly around testing for consciousness. It proposes a structured ethical framework to navigate this sensitive area while protecting potentially conscious AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the ethical paradox in AI research: determining AI consciousness might harm entities whose moral status is uncertain. Existing frameworks are inadequate for the unique challenges of consciousness research.

Method: A three-tier phenomenological assessment system is proposed, combined with a five-category capacity framework (Agency, Capability, Knowledge, Ethics, Reasoning). This approach is inspired by Talmudic legal reasoning.

Result: The proposed framework provides structured protection protocols based on observable behaviors, tackling challenges like identifying consciousness markers, graduated consent, and ethical justifications for harmful research.

Conclusion: The study provides an actionable ethical approach for AI consciousness research, combining ancient legal reasoning and modern science, and laying groundwork for future AI rights considerations.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence research faces a critical ethical paradox: determining whether AI systems are conscious requires experiments that may harm entities whose moral status remains uncertain. Recent work proposes avoiding consciousness-uncertain AI systems entirely, yet this faces practical limitations-we cannot guarantee such systems will not emerge. This paper addresses a gap in research ethics frameworks: how to conduct consciousness research on AI systems whose moral status cannot be definitively established. Existing graduated moral status frameworks assume consciousness has already been determined before assigning protections, creating a temporal ordering problem for consciousness detection research itself. Drawing from Talmudic scenario-based legal reasoning-developed for entities whose status cannot be definitively established-we propose a three-tier phenomenological assessment system combined with a five-category capacity framework (Agency, Capability, Knowledge, Ethics, Reasoning). The framework provides structured protection protocols based on observable behavioral indicators while consciousness status remains uncertain. We address three challenges: why suffering behaviors provide reliable consciousness markers, how to implement graduated consent without requiring consciousness certainty, and when potentially harmful research becomes ethically justifiable. The framework demonstrates how ancient legal wisdom combined with contemporary consciousness science can provide implementable guidance for ethics committees, offering testable protocols that ameliorate the consciousness detection paradox while establishing foundations for AI rights considerations.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a formal, enforceable regulatory framework called AI Deployment Authorisation Score (ADAS) to assess whether AI systems should legally operate in specific domains and jurisdictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of enforceable mechanisms for determining the legal operability of AI systems in specific domains and jurisdictions.

Method: The authors designed ADAS, a framework that evaluates AI systems across five dimensions (risk, alignment, externality, control, and auditability) and produces cryptographically verifiable deployment certificates.

Result: ADAS introduces deployment certificates accepted by regulators, insurers, and operators, enabling compliance with laws and policies such as the EU AI Act and U.S. infrastructure governance.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that deployment-level authorization is the missing layer for ensuring safe, legal, and scalable AI deployment, surpassing current model-level evaluations.

Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence governance lacks a formal, enforceable mechanism for determining whether a given AI system is legally permitted to operate in a specific domain and jurisdiction. Existing tools such as model cards, audits, and benchmark evaluations provide descriptive information about model behavior and training data but do not produce binding deployment decisions with legal or financial force. This paper introduces the AI Deployment Authorisation Score (ADAS), a machine-readable regulatory framework that evaluates AI systems across five legally and economically grounded dimensions: risk, alignment, externality, control, and auditability. ADAS produces a cryptographically verifiable deployment certificate that regulators, insurers, and infrastructure operators can consume as a license to operate, using public-key verification and transparency mechanisms adapted from secure software supply chain and certificate transparency systems. The paper presents the formal specification, decision logic, evidence model, and policy architecture of ADAS and demonstrates how it operationalizes the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act, United States critical infrastructure governance, and insurance underwriting requirements by compiling statutory and regulatory obligations into machine-executable deployment gates. We argue that deployment-level authorization, rather than model-level evaluation, constitutes the missing institutional layer required for safe, lawful, and economically scalable artificial intelligence.

### [299] [The Illusion of Friendship: Why Generative AI Demands Unprecedented Ethical Vigilance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08874)
*Md Zahidul Islam*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper discusses the ethical risks of perceiving GenAI systems as friends and proposes safeguards to prevent emotional attachments and over-reliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the ethical concerns surrounding emotional attachments users may form with GenAI systems, due to their perceived empathy and relational qualities.

Method: The paper draws on classical accounts of friendship, explains the limitations of GenAI's moral agency, provides a computational explanation of GenAI's response generation, and proposes a safeguard framework for ethical usage.

Result: It demonstrates how GenAI's responses can create emotionally resonant language despite lacking inner states, and offers a framework to reduce anthropomorphic cues and mitigate risks of emotional misattribution.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that understanding GenAI's limitations and implementing safeguards can preserve its benefits while minimizing emotional dependency and ethical concerns.

Abstract: GenAI systems are increasingly used for drafting, summarisation, and decision support, offering substantial gains in productivity and reduced cognitive load. However, the same natural language fluency that makes these systems useful can also blur the boundary between tool and companion. This boundary confusion may encourage some users to experience GenAI as empathic, benevolent, and relationally persistent. Emerging reports suggest that some users may form emotionally significant attachments to conversational agents, in some cases with harmful consequences, including dependency and impaired judgment. This paper develops a philosophical and ethical argument for why the resulting illusion of friendship is both understandable and can be ethically risky. Drawing on classical accounts of friendship, the paper explains why users may understandably interpret sustained supportive interaction as friend like. It then advances a counterargument that despite relational appearances, GenAI lacks moral agency: consciousness, intention, and accountability and therefore does not qualify as a true friend. To demystify the illusion, the paper presents a mechanism level explanation of how transformer based GenAI generates responses often producing emotionally resonant language without inner states or commitments. Finally, the paper proposes a safeguard framework for safe and responsible GenAI use to reduce possible anthropomorphic cues generated by the GenAI systems. The central contribution is to demystify the illusion of friendship and explain the computational background so that we can shift the emotional attachment with GenAI towards necessary human responsibility and thereby understand how institutions, designers, and users can preserve GenAI's benefits while mitigating over reliance and emotional misattribution.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces PluriHarms, a benchmark to study human harm judgments and disagreement dimensions for AI safety models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI safety models often address harmfulness in binary terms and neglect nuanced differences in human judgments and disagreements, limiting progress toward building pluralistic systems.

Method: Developed PluriHarms, a benchmark with diverse prompts representing human values. It analyzes 150 prompts with ratings from 100 annotators, examining traits, interactions, and disagreement about AI harm judgments.

Result: Prompts eliciting imminent risks amplify harmfulness perceptions, while annotator demographics and traits provide insights into disagreement patterns. Personalization improves alignment models but issues persist.

Conclusion: This benchmark advances AI safety by emphasizing human value diversity and disagreement in harm judgments, guiding future development of pluralistic and safe systems.

Abstract: Current AI safety frameworks, which often treat harmfulness as binary, lack the flexibility to handle borderline cases where humans meaningfully disagree. To build more pluralistic systems, it is essential to move beyond consensus and instead understand where and why disagreements arise. We introduce PluriHarms, a benchmark designed to systematically study human harm judgments across two key dimensions -- the harm axis (benign to harmful) and the agreement axis (agreement to disagreement). Our scalable framework generates prompts that capture diverse AI harms and human values while targeting cases with high disagreement rates, validated by human data. The benchmark includes 150 prompts with 15,000 ratings from 100 human annotators, enriched with demographic and psychological traits and prompt-level features of harmful actions, effects, and values. Our analyses show that prompts that relate to imminent risks and tangible harms amplify perceived harmfulness, while annotator traits (e.g., toxicity experience, education) and their interactions with prompt content explain systematic disagreement. We benchmark AI safety models and alignment methods on PluriHarms, finding that while personalization significantly improves prediction of human harm judgments, considerable room remains for future progress. By explicitly targeting value diversity and disagreement, our work provides a principled benchmark for moving beyond "one-size-fits-all" safety toward pluralistically safe AI.

*Shalmoli Ghosh,Matthew R. DeVerna,Filippo Menczer*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The study analyzes Civitai's bounty system for AI-generated content over 14 months, revealing significant bias, ethical concerns, and the prevalence of NSFW (Not Safe for Work) and explicit deepfake requests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Civitai's bounty system incentivizes content creation and its ethical implications, especially regarding NSFW and deepfake media.

Method: The authors conducted a longitudinal analysis of all publicly available bounty requests over a 14-month period, studying trends and participation disparities.

Result: Findings show high demand for NSFW content, increasing explicit deepfake requests targeting identifiable individuals (mostly female celebrities), and unequal participation in bounty creation.

Conclusion: Monetized platforms like Civitai raise ethical issues, including gender-specific harms, governance challenges, consent concerns, and policy enforcement problems.

Abstract: Generative AI systems increasingly enable the production of highly realistic synthetic media. Civitai, a popular community-driven platform for AI-generated content, operates a monetized feature called Bounties, which allows users to commission the generation of content in exchange for payment. To examine how this mechanism is used and what content it incentivizes, we conduct a longitudinal analysis of all publicly available bounty requests collected over a 14-month period following the platform's launch. We find that the bounty marketplace is dominated by tools that let users steer AI models toward content they were not trained to generate. At the same time, requests for content that is "Not Safe For Work" are widespread and have increased steadily over time, now comprising a majority of all bounties. Participation in bounty creation is uneven, with 20% of requesters accounting for roughly half of requests. Requests for "deepfake" - media depicting identifiable real individuals - exhibit a higher concentration than other types of bounties. A nontrivial subset of these requests involves explicit deepfakes despite platform policies prohibiting such content. These bounties disproportionately target female celebrities, revealing a pronounced gender asymmetry in social harm. Together, these findings show how monetized, community-driven generative AI platforms can produce gendered harms, raising questions about consent, governance, and enforcement.

### [303] [Information Access of the Oppressed: A Problem-Posing Framework for Envisioning Emancipatory Information Access Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09600)
*Bhaskar Mitra,Nicola Neophytou,Sireesh Gururaja*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper applies Paulo Freire's theory of emancipatory pedagogy to reimagine information access (IA) platforms as tools to resist authoritarian control and empower marginalized communities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address and prevent the authoritarian capture of online IA platforms in the face of rising democratic erosion, the capabilities of generative AI, and Big Tech's concentrated power.

Method: The authors utilize Freire’s theories to challenge the technologist-user dichotomy, proposing that marginalized communities actively engage in shaping technologies as part of their struggle against oppression. They also propose redesigning online technology stacks to integrate spaces for community involvement.

Result: The paper introduces a problem-posing framework based on Freire's theories, aimed at designing IA platforms that empower marginalized communities to co-create and adapt technologies for their emancipation.

Conclusion: The study advocates for a shift in responsibility from technologists creating solutions unilaterally to collaborative, community-driven processes that foster equitable and emancipatory technology development.

Abstract: Online information access (IA) platforms are targets of authoritarian capture. These concerns are particularly serious and urgent today in light of the rising levels of democratic erosion worldwide, the emerging capabilities of generative AI technologies such as AI persuasion, and the increasing concentration of economic and political power in the hands of Big Tech. This raises the question of what alternative IA infrastructure we must reimagine and build to mitigate the risks of authoritarian capture of our information ecosystems. We explore this question through the lens of Paulo Freire's theories of emancipatory pedagogy. Freire's theories provide a radically different lens for exploring IA's sociotechnical concerns relative to the current dominating frames of fairness, accountability, confidentiality, transparency, and safety. We make explicit, with the intention to challenge, the dichotomy of how we relate to technology as either technologists (who envision and build technology) and its users. We posit that this mirrors the teacher-student relationship in Freire's analysis. By extending Freire's analysis to IA, we challenge the notion that it is the burden of the (altruistic) technologists to come up with interventions to mitigate the risks that emerging technologies pose to marginalized communities. Instead, we advocate that the first task for the technologists is to pose these as problems to the marginalized communities, to encourage them to make and unmake the technology as part of their material struggle against oppression. Their second task is to redesign our online technology stacks to structurally expose spaces for community members to co-opt and co-construct the technology in aid of their emancipatory struggles. We operationalize Freire's theories to develop a problem-posing framework for envisioning emancipatory IA platforms of the future.

*Ryan Feng Lin,Keyu Tian,Hanming Zheng,Congjing Zhang,Li Zeng,Shuai Huang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces CrowdLLM, a model integrating pretrained language models and generative models to create diverse and accurate digital populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create cost-effective and representative digital populations for applications like social simulation and marketing, addressing the limitations of existing methods that rely solely on LLMs and fail to match real human diversity and accuracy.

Method: CrowdLLM combines pretrained large language models with generative models to enhance both diversity and fidelity of digital populations. The approach is also supported by theoretical analyses and experimental evaluations.

Result: The experiments across various domains demonstrate that CrowdLLM achieves high accuracy and closely matches the distributional fidelity of human data.

Conclusion: CrowdLLM offers a scalable and reliable solution for generating digital populations, effectively overcoming the limitations of current methods and providing a strong alternative to real human crowds.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has sparked much interest in creating LLM-based digital populations that can be applied to many applications such as social simulation, crowdsourcing, marketing, and recommendation systems. A digital population can reduce the cost of recruiting human participants and alleviate many concerns related to human subject study. However, research has found that most of the existing works rely solely on LLMs and could not sufficiently capture the accuracy and diversity of a real human population. To address this limitation, we propose CrowdLLM that integrates pretrained LLMs and generative models to enhance the diversity and fidelity of the digital population. We conduct theoretical analysis of CrowdLLM regarding its great potential in creating cost-effective, sufficiently representative, scalable digital populations that can match the quality of a real crowd. Comprehensive experiments are also conducted across multiple domains (e.g., crowdsourcing, voting, user rating) and simulation studies which demonstrate that CrowdLLM achieves promising performance in both accuracy and distributional fidelity to human data.

*Miki Ueno*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mikasa, an AI companion built on strong character design and a clearly defined relationship inspired by Japanese Oshi culture, which enhances user satisfaction and engagement through stable personality and relationship norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI companions struggle to keep users engaged long-term, not due to weak models but due to poor character design and undefined user-AI relationship dynamics.

Method: The paper employs a case study approach using Mikasa, an AI companion designed with a coherent character and stable personality, emphasizing long-term non-exclusive commitment from Oshi culture.

Result: Exploratory evaluation shows users prioritize conversational naturalness, relationship control, and imaginative engagement, with character coherence and relationship definition emerging as key latent structural elements.

Conclusion: Character design in AI companions is essential for meaningful, engaging interactions. While Mikasa's design is culturally specific, the principles of consistent personality and clear relationship definition can be broadly applied.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models and multimodal interaction has made it possible to develop AI companions that can have fluent and emotionally expressive conversations. However, many of these systems have problems keeping users satisfied and engaged over long periods. This paper argues that these problems do not come mainly from weak models, but from poor character design and unclear definitions of the user-AI relationship. I present Mikasa, an emotional AI companion inspired by Japanese Oshi culture-specifically its emphasis on long-term, non-exclusive commitment to a stable character-as a case study of character-driven companion design. Mikasa does not work as a general-purpose assistant or a chatbot that changes roles. Instead, Mikasa is designed as a coherent character with a stable personality and a clearly defined relationship as a partner. This relationship does not force exclusivity or obligation. Rather, it works as a reference point that stabilizes interaction norms and reduces the work users must do to keep redefining the relationship. Through an exploratory evaluation, I see that users describe their preferences using surface-level qualities such as conversational naturalness, but they also value relationship control and imaginative engagement in ways they do not state directly. These results suggest that character coherence and relationship definition work as latent structural elements that shape how good the interaction feels, without users recognizing them as main features. The contribution of this work is to show that character design is a functional part of AI companion systems, not just decoration. Mikasa is one example based on a specific cultural context, but the design principles-commitment to a consistent personality and clear relationship definition-can be used for many emotionally grounded AI companions.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper explores the impact of varying levels of AI disclosures on news readers' trust, source-checking, and subscription decisions, finding a trade-off between transparency and trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate transparency dilemmas in AI usage disclosures in news and their influence on readers' trust and behaviors.

Method: A mixed factorial study with 40 participants examining three levels of AI disclosures, two news types, and varying AI involvement. Measures include trust questionnaire, source-checking, and subscription decisions.

Result: Trust declined with detailed disclosures but increased source-checking behavior for both one-line and detailed disclosures. Two-thirds of participants preferred detailed disclosures, though some favored detail-on-demand models.

Conclusion: AI disclosures do not universally reduce trust but highlight the trade-off between transparency preferences and trust in AI-integrated news.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into news production, calls for transparency about the use of AI have gained considerable traction. Recent studies suggest that AI disclosures can lead to a ``transparency dilemma'', where disclosure reduces readers' trust. However, little is known about how the \textit{level of detail} in AI disclosures influences trust and contributes to this dilemma within the news context. In this 3$\times$2$\times$2 mixed factorial study with 40 participants, we investigate how three levels of AI disclosures (none, one-line, detailed) across two types of news (politics and lifestyle) and two levels of AI involvement (low and high) affect news readers' trust. We measured trust using the News Media Trust questionnaire, along with two decision behaviors: source-checking and subscription decisions. Questionnaire responses and subscription rates showed a decline in trust only for detailed AI disclosures, whereas source-checking behavior increased for both one-line and detailed disclosures, with the effect being more pronounced for detailed disclosures. Insights from semi-structured interviews suggest that source-checking behavior was primarily driven by interest in the topic, followed by trust, whereas trust was the main factor influencing subscription decisions. Around two-thirds of participants expressed a preference for detailed disclosures, while most participants who preferred one-line indicated a need for detail-on-demand disclosure formats. Our findings show that not all AI disclosures lead to a transparency dilemma, but instead reflect a trade-off between readers' desire for more transparency and their trust in AI-assisted news content.

### [307] [Navigating Ideation Space: Decomposed Conceptual Representations for Positioning Scientific Ideas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08901)
*Yuexi Shen,Minqian Liu,Dawei Zhou,Lifu Huang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Ideation Space,' a structured approach to improve literature retrieval and novelty assessment in scientific discovery, offering significant improvements in performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific discovery requires placing new ideas in context with existing literature, but challenges include identifying relevant prior work and assessing novelty amidst rapidly growing literature.

Method: The authors propose the 'Ideation Space,' which decomposes scientific knowledge into three distinct dimensions—research problem, methodology, and findings—using contrastive training. They also introduce a Hierarchical Sub-Space Retrieval framework and a Decomposed Novelty Assessment algorithm.

Result: The proposed methods deliver Recall@30 of 0.329 (a 16.7% improvement), ideation transition retrieval with Hit Rate@30 of 0.643, and novelty assessment achieving 0.37 correlation with expert judgments.

Conclusion: This work provides a structured framework for advancing scientific discovery through improved literature retrieval and novelty evaluation, showcasing its effectiveness in experimental scenarios.

Abstract: Scientific discovery is a cumulative process and requires new ideas to be situated within an ever-expanding landscape of existing knowledge. An emerging and critical challenge is how to identify conceptually relevant prior work from rapidly growing literature, and assess how a new idea differentiates from existing research. Current embedding approaches typically conflate distinct conceptual aspects into single representations and cannot support fine-grained literature retrieval; meanwhile, LLM-based evaluators are subject to sycophancy biases, failing to provide discriminative novelty assessment. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Ideation Space, a structured representation that decomposes scientific knowledge into three distinct dimensions, i.e., research problem, methodology, and core findings, each learned through contrastive training. This framework enables principled measurement of conceptual distance between ideas, and modeling of ideation transitions that capture the logical connections within a proposed idea. Building upon this representation, we propose a Hierarchical Sub-Space Retrieval framework for efficient, targeted literature retrieval, and a Decomposed Novelty Assessment algorithm that identifies which aspects of an idea are novel. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements, where our approach achieves Recall@30 of 0.329 (16.7% over baselines), our ideation transition retrieval reaches Hit Rate@30 of 0.643, and novelty assessment attains 0.37 correlation with expert judgments. In summary, our work provides a promising paradigm for future research on accelerating and evaluating scientific discovery.

### [308] [Fine Grained Evaluation of LLMs-as-Judges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08919)
*Sourav Saha,Mandar Mitra*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper investigates the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) as evaluators in Information Retrieval, emphasizing their ability to highlight relevant document passages and comparing their effectiveness to human judges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as relevance assessors and quality evaluators for information retrieval tasks, particularly at the passage level similar to human assessments.

Method: Using a test collection from the INEX initiative, the study analyzed LLMs' ability to highlight relevant document passages. These outputs were compared against human relevance assessors who followed similar instructions.

Result: The analysis revealed that LLMs perform better as judges when supervised by humans, indicating limitations in their autonomous evaluation capabilities.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as effective judges for document and passage relevance when supported by human supervision, suggesting their complementary role in information retrieval tasks.

Abstract: A good deal of recent research has focused on how Large Language Models
  (LLMs) may be used as `judges' in place of humans to evaluate the quality
  of the output produced by various text / image processing systems. Within
  this broader context, a number of studies have investigated the specific
  question of how effectively LLMs can be used as relevance assessors for
  the standard ad hoc task in Information Retrieval (IR). We extend these
  studies by looking at additional questions. Most importantly, we use a
  Wikipedia based test collection created by the INEX initiative, and
  prompt LLMs to not only judge whether documents are relevant /
  non-relevant, but to highlight relevant passages in documents that it
  regards as useful. The human relevance assessors involved in creating
  this collection were given analogous instructions, i.e., they were asked
  to highlight all passages within a document that respond to the
  information need expressed in a query. This enables us to evaluate the
  quality of LLMs as judges not only at the document level, but to also
  quantify how often these `judges' are right for the right reasons.
  Our findings suggest that LLMs-as-judges work best under human
  supervision.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a discourse-based LLM methodology using RST to analyze judicial reasoning in copyright damage awards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inconsistencies and unpredictability in judicial reasoning across jurisdictions regarding copyright damages require better computational analysis.

Method: The framework integrates Rhetorical Structure Theory with an agentic workflow using a three-stage pipeline: Dataset Construction, Discourse Analysis, and Agentic Feature Extraction.

Result: Discourse-augmented LLM outperforms traditional methods and reveals variation in judicial factor weighting across circuits.

Conclusion: The approach advances computational legal analysis, provides insights into judicial reasoning, and has implications for tools, scholarship, and policy in copyright law.

Abstract: Judicial reasoning in copyright damage awards poses a core challenge for computational legal analysis. Although federal courts follow the 1976 Copyright Act, their interpretations and factor weightings vary widely across jurisdictions. This inconsistency creates unpredictability for litigants and obscures the empirical basis of legal decisions. This research introduces a novel discourse-based Large Language Model (LLM) methodology that integrates Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) with an agentic workflow to extract and quantify previously opaque reasoning patterns from judicial opinions. Our framework addresses a major gap in empirical legal scholarship by parsing opinions into hierarchical discourse structures and using a three-stage pipeline, i.e., Dataset Construction, Discourse Analysis, and Agentic Feature Extraction. This pipeline identifies reasoning components and extract feature labels with corresponding discourse subtrees. In analyzing copyright damage rulings, we show that discourse-augmented LLM analysis outperforms traditional methods while uncovering unquantified variations in factor weighting across circuits. These findings offer both methodological advances in computational legal analysis and practical insights into judicial reasoning, with implications for legal practitioners seeking predictive tools, scholars studying legal principle application, and policymakers confronting inconsistencies in copyright law.

### [310] [Why not Collaborative Filtering in Dual View? Bridging Sparse and Dense Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09286)
*Hanze Guo,Jianxun Lian,Xiao Zhou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes SaD (Sparse and Dense), a new framework to address the shortcomings in collaborative filtering by combining dense embeddings and sparse interaction patterns to improve recommendation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current collaborative filtering methods using dense embedding-based models struggle with signal-to-noise ratio limitations, especially for unpopular items under data sparsity.

Method: The paper develops a dual-view framework where dense embeddings add semantic richness to sparse patterns, and sparse views enhance dense models through structural signals via a bidirectional alignment mechanism.

Result: Experiments show that the SaD framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks and surpasses strong baselines while being compatible with a variety of existing models.

Conclusion: SaD improves the efficiency and effectiveness of collaborative filtering by combining sparse and dense perspectives, providing improved recommendations and broader applicability.

Abstract: Collaborative Filtering (CF) remains the cornerstone of modern recommender systems, with dense embedding--based methods dominating current practice. However, these approaches suffer from a critical limitation: our theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ceiling when modeling unpopular items, where parameter-based dense models experience diminishing SNR under severe data sparsity. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SaD (Sparse and Dense), a unified framework that integrates the semantic expressiveness of dense embeddings with the structural reliability of sparse interaction patterns. We theoretically show that aligning these dual views yields a strictly superior global SNR. Concretely, SaD introduces a lightweight bidirectional alignment mechanism: the dense view enriches the sparse view by injecting semantic correlations, while the sparse view regularizes the dense model through explicit structural signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under this dual-view alignment, even a simple matrix factorization--style dense model can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, SaD is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of existing recommender models, highlighting the enduring power of collaborative filtering when leveraged from dual perspectives. Further evaluations on real-world benchmarks show that SaD consistently outperforms strong baselines, ranking first on the BarsMatch leaderboard.

### [311] [On-Device Large Language Models for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09306)
*Xin Xia,Hongzhi Yin,Shane Culpepper*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces OD-LLM, a compression framework for large language models to enable efficient on-device deployment for sequential recommendation tasks without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-device recommendation is essential for applications needing low latency, privacy, robustness in unstable internet conditions, and efficient operation on resource-constrained devices. Existing LLMs, despite their performance, are challenging to deploy due to high memory and computational requirements.

Method: OD-LLM integrates two compression techniques: low-rank structural compression via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and tokenization normalization. Additionally, a progressive alignment algorithm enhances model refinement layerwise to avoid performance degradation.

Result: OD-LLM achieves on-device deployment by halving the model size while maintaining effectiveness, as demonstrated in sequential recommendation benchmarks.

Conclusion: OD-LLM proves to be a scalable, efficient solution for replacing remote LLM services with resource-friendly, on-device models for real-time recommendation tasks.

Abstract: On-device recommendation is critical for a number of real-world applications, especially in scenarios that have agreements on execution latency, user privacy, and robust functionality when internet connectivity is unstable or even impossible. While large language models (LLMs) can now provide exceptional capabilities that model user behavior for sequential recommendation tasks, their substantial memory footprint and computational overhead make the deployment on resource-constrained devices a high risk proposition. In this paper, we propose OD-LLM, the first task-adaptive compression framework explicitly designed to provide efficient and accurate on-device deployment of LLMs for sequential recommendation tasks. OD-LLM uniquely integrates two complementary compression strategies: a low-rank structural compression algorithm which uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to significantly reduce parameter redundancy in the model, and a novel tokenization normalization technique that better complements the low-rank decomposition process being used. Additionally, to minimize any potential performance degradation when using higher compression ratios, a novel progressive alignment algorithm is used to iteratively refine the parameters required layerwise in the target model. Empirical evaluations conducted on sequential recommendation benchmarks show that OD-LLM exhibits no loss in effectiveness when compared to the original recommendation model, when the deployed model size is halved. These promising results demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of OD-LLM, making this novel solution a practical alternative for real-time, on-device solutions wishing to replace expensive, remotely executed LLMs.

*Renqiang Luo,Dong Zhang,Yupeng Gao,Wen Shi,Mingliang Hou,Jiaying Liu,Zhe Wang,Shuo Yu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces FairLRM, a new framework to tackle popularity bias in recommender systems through advanced semantic understanding using large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to address the deeper semantic causes of popularity bias in recommender systems, which limits effectiveness and accuracy in recommendations.

Method: FairLRM uses large language models with structured, instructional prompts to semantically break down popularity bias into item-side and user-side components.

Result: FairLRM improves both fairness and recommendation accuracy through enhanced semantic understanding of popularity bias, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: The framework provides a more effective, trustworthy, and semantically aware solution for addressing popularity bias in recommender systems, advancing fairness and recommendation quality.

Abstract: Semantic understanding of popularity bias is a crucial yet underexplored challenge in recommender systems, where popular items are often favored at the expense of niche content. Most existing debiasing methods treat the semantic understanding of popularity bias as a matter of diversity enhancement or long-tail coverage, neglecting the deeper semantic layer that embodies the causal origins of the bias itself. Consequently, such shallow interpretations limit both their debiasing effectiveness and recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose FairLRM, a novel framework that bridges the gap in the semantic understanding of popularity bias with Recommendation via Large Language Model (RecLLM). FairLRM decomposes popularity bias into item-side and user-side components, using structured instruction-based prompts to enhance the model's comprehension of both global item distributions and individual user preferences. Unlike traditional methods that rely on surface-level features such as "diversity" or "debiasing", FairLRM improves the model's ability to semantically interpret and address the underlying bias. Through empirical evaluation, we show that FairLRM significantly enhances both fairness and recommendation accuracy, providing a more semantically aware and trustworthy approach to enhance the semantic understanding of popularity bias. The implementation is available at https://github.com/LuoRenqiang/FairLRM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how lying about preferences can affect resource distribution under an egalitarian welfare model and to explore the practical implications of this behavior.

Method: A practical study was conducted using genetic algorithms to analyze the benefits and outcomes of lying in various scenarios.

Result: The results provide insights into the situations where agents might gain by lying and how it impacts equitable resource allocation.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the risks posed by strategic misrepresentation of preferences during resource allocation based on egalitarian principles, providing key insights for system design.

Abstract: When some resources are to be distributed among a set of agents following egalitarian social welfare, the goal is to maximize the utility of the agent whose utility turns out to be minimal. In this context, agents can have an incentive to lie about their actual preferences, so that more valuable resources are assigned to them. In this paper we analyze this situation, and we present a practical study where genetic algorithms are used to assess the benefits of lying under different situations.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores Android malware detection using a multimodal approach with image and textual data from APK files, systematically assessing image types and resolutions while integrating textual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research fails to fully utilize textual data in Android APKs and overlooks how image attributes affect malware detection, necessitating a more robust approach.

Method: A multimodal deep learning framework is developed, combining APK image and textual features. Various CNN architectures (VGG, ResNet-152, MobileNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet-B4) are tested, and LLaMA-2 is used for textual data processing.

Result: The study finds that RGB images at higher resolutions achieve better results. However, combining image and text data using the CLIP model offers limited improvement.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal data and evaluating image characteristics are crucial to improving Android malware detection methods.

Abstract: As zero-day Android malware attacks grow more sophisticated, recent research highlights the effectiveness of using image-based representations of malware bytecode to detect previously unseen threats. However, existing studies often overlook how image type and resolution affect detection and ignore valuable textual data in Android Application Packages (APKs), such as permissions and metadata, limiting their ability to fully capture malicious behavior. The integration of multimodality, which combines image and text data, has gained momentum as a promising approach to address these limitations. This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning framework integrating APK images and textual features to enhance Android malware detection. We systematically evaluate various image types and resolutions across different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures, including VGG, ResNet-152, MobileNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet-B4, and use LLaMA-2, a large language model, to extract and annotate textual features for improved analysis. The findings demonstrate that RGB images at higher resolutions (e.g., 256x256, 512x512) achieve superior classification performance, while the multimodal integration of image and text using the CLIP model reveals limited potential. Overall, this research highlights the importance of systematically evaluating image attributes and integrating multimodal data to develop effective malware detection for Android systems.

Result: The developed verifier was tested on four sets of Noir programs, showing practical use and highlighting a challenging constraint type that indicates areas for framework enhancement.

Conclusion: The work provides a robust verifier capable of ensuring appropriate constraints in Noir programs while revealing challenges that can guide further development in the verification domain.

Abstract: Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof systems are cryptographic protocols that can (with overwhelming probability) demonstrate that the pair $(X, W)$ is in a relation $R$ without revealing information about the private input $W$. This membership checking is captured by a complex arithmetic circuit: a set of polynomial equations over a finite field. ZK programming languages, like Noir, have been proposed to simplify the description of these circuits. A developer can write a Noir program using traditional high-level constructs that can be compiled into a lower-level ACIR (Abstract Circuit Intermediate Representation), which is essentially a high-level description of an arithmetic circuit. In this paper, we formalise some of the ACIR language using SMT-LIB and its extended theory of finite fields. We use this formalisation to create an open-source formal verifier for the Noir language using the SMT solver cvc5. Our verifier can be used to check whether Noir programs behave appropriately. For instance, it can be used to check whether a Noir program has been properly constrained, that is, the finite-field polynomial equations generated truly capture the intended relation. We evaluate our verifier over 4 distinct sets of Noir programs, demonstrating its practical applicability and identifying a hard-to-check constraint type that charts an improvement path for our verification framework.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates large language models (LLMs) for proactively identifying indicators of compromise (IOCs) from online threat intelligence sources, finding significant performance differences across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance proactive malware threat detection by leveraging LLMs to extract indicators of compromise (IOCs) from unstructured web-based threat intelligence sources.

Method: Developed an automated system that retrieves IOCs from 15 online threat report sources and evaluated six LLMs (Gemini, Qwen, Llama variants) on their ability to identify malicious IOCs using a dataset of 479 webpages containing 2,658 IOCs.

Result: Gemini 1.5 Pro achieved high precision (0.958), specificity (0.788), and perfect recall (1.0) in identifying malicious IOCs among six evaluated LLM models.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in enhancing proactive threat detection through accurate extraction and identification of IOCs, with Gemini 1.5 Pro leading in performance.

Abstract: Enterprise security faces escalating threats from sophisticated malware, compounded by expanding digital operations. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of large language models (LLMs) to proactively identify indicators of compromise (IOCs) from unstructured web-based threat intelligence sources, distinguishing it from reactive malware detection approaches. We developed an automated system that pulls IOCs from 15 web-based threat report sources to evaluate six LLM models (Gemini, Qwen, and Llama variants). Our evaluation of 479 webpages containing 2,658 IOCs (711 IPv4 addresses, 502 IPv6 addresses, 1,445 domains) reveals significant performance variations. Gemini 1.5 Pro achieved 0.958 precision and 0.788 specificity for malicious IOC identification, while demonstrating perfect recall (1.0) for actual threats.

*Aniesh Chawla,Udbhav Prasad*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper examines the use of fine-tuned Large Language Models for classifying code as benign or malicious, showing promise but highlighting limitations against emerging malware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how Large Language Models can assist in identifying malicious code, addressing the evolving landscape of cyber threats.

Method: An automated pipeline decompiles Windows executables into C code using Ghidra, then utilizes LLMs for classification between malicious and benign code.

Result: Standard LLMs demonstrate potential but lack robustness compared to fine-tuned models, which perform better but degrade against newer malware.

Conclusion: Continuous fine-tuning with emerging cybersecurity threats is essential to maintain the effectiveness of LLM-based tools against evolving malware.

Abstract: The parallel evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) with advanced code-understanding capabilities and the increasing sophistication of malware presents a new frontier for cybersecurity research. This paper evaluates the efficacy of state-of-the-art LLMs in classifying executable code as either benign or malicious. We introduce an automated pipeline that first decompiles Windows executable into a C code using Ghidra disassembler and then leverages LLMs to perform the classification. Our evaluation reveals that while standard LLMs show promise, they are not yet robust enough to replace traditional anti-virus software. We demonstrate that a fine-tuned model, trained on curated malware and benign datasets, significantly outperforms its vanilla counterpart. However, the performance of even this specialized model degrades notably when encountering newer malware. This finding demonstrates the critical need for continuous fine-tuning with emerging threats to maintain model effectiveness against the changing coding patterns and behaviors of malicious software.

### [318] [StegoStylo: Squelching Stylometric Scrutiny through Steganographic Stitching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09056)
*Robert Dilworth*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper discusses the use of stylometry for authorship attribution and its potential misuse for privacy-invading activities, introducing TraceTarnish and steganography-based techniques to counteract these threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are driven by the need to address privacy challenges associated with stylometry's misuse in de-anonymization, re-identification, and tracking, advocating defensive methods against such threats.

Method: This research enhances the adversarial attack TraceTarnish and fine-tunes steganographic techniques to disrupt stylometric analysis. Experiments measure the effectiveness of authorship obfuscation by altering text with zero-width Unicode characters.

Result: The study demonstrates that a 33% or higher steganographic coverage ensures significant authorship obfuscation, reducing the efficiency of stylometric attribution and verification systems.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the importance of tools like TraceTarnish to safeguard privacy, urging for more robust defenses against the privacy risks posed by stylometry.

Abstract: Stylometry--the identification of an author through analysis of a text's style (i.e., authorship attribution)--serves many constructive purposes: it supports copyright and plagiarism investigations, aids detection of harmful content, offers exploratory cues for certain medical conditions (e.g., early signs of dementia or depression), provides historical context for literary works, and helps uncover misinformation and disinformation. In contrast, when stylometry is employed as a tool for authorship verification--confirming whether a text truly originates from a claimed author--it can also be weaponized for malicious purposes. Techniques such as de-anonymization, re-identification, tracking, profiling, and downstream effects like censorship illustrate the privacy threats that stylometric analysis can enable. Building on these concerns, this paper further explores how adversarial stylometry combined with steganography can counteract stylometric analysis. We first present enhancements to our adversarial attack, $\textit{TraceTarnish}$, providing stronger evidence of its capacity to confound stylometric systems and reduce their attribution and verification accuracy. Next, we examine how steganographic embedding can be fine-tuned to mask an author's stylistic fingerprint, quantifying the level of authorship obfuscation achievable as a function of the proportion of words altered with zero-width Unicode characters. Based on our findings, steganographic coverage of 33% or higher seemingly ensures authorship obfuscation. Finally, we reflect on the ways stylometry can be used to undermine privacy and argue for the necessity of defensive tools like $\textit{TraceTarnish}$.

*Mitchell Petingola*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of raw x86-64 machine code for vulnerability detection using deep learning, focusing on the performance of graph-based models versus sequential models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether raw machine code can serve as an efficient and effective data source for vulnerability detection, contrasting the traditional reliance on disassembled assembly language.

Method: The study evaluates two deep learning architectures—graph-based and sequential—regarding their performance in detecting three vulnerability types using raw machine code features.

Result: Graph-based models outperform sequential models, highlighting the importance of data representation via control flow relationships. Additionally, raw machine code contains enough information for vulnerability detection.

Conclusion: The study shows that raw x86-64 machine code can be leveraged for vulnerability detection and supports using graph-based architectures for superior performance.

Abstract: While much of the current research in deep learning-based vulnerability detection relies on disassembled binaries, this paper explores the feasibility of extracting features directly from raw x86-64 machine code. Although assembly language is more interpretable for humans, it requires more complex models to capture token-level context. In contrast, machine code may enable more efficient, lightweight models and preserve all information that might be lost in disassembly. This paper approaches the task of vulnerability detection through an exploratory study on two specific deep learning model architectures and aims to systematically evaluate their performance across three vulnerability types. The results demonstrate that graph-based models consistently outperform sequential models, emphasizing the importance of control flow relationships, and that machine code contains sufficient information for effective vulnerability discovery.

*Dafne Lozano-Paredes,Luis Bote-Curiel,Juan Ramón Feijóo-Martínez,Ismael Gómez-Talal,José Luis Rojo-Álvarez*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces an unsupervised, explainable anomaly detection framework for IEC 61850 GOOSE networks, achieving over 99% detection rates while addressing security gaps in power system protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the vulnerability of IEC 61850 GOOSE networks to advanced cyberattacks due to their lack of security mechanisms, and the inadequacy of traditional methods to handle protocol compliance, zero-day attacks, class imbalance, and limited labeled data.

Method: The method involves using asymmetric autoencoders trained on operational traffic to separate semantic and timing anomalies. Anomalies are detected using reconstruction errors and thresholds, with explainability provided through feature-level analysis linked to protocol characteristics.

Result: Experimental results show that the framework achieves attack detection rates of over 99% with false positives below 5%, demonstrating robustness against class imbalance and attack variability.

Conclusion: This framework effectively addresses cybersecurity threats in digital substations, offering robust and interpretable anomaly detection with minimal false positives.

Abstract: The IEC 61850 Generic Object-Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) protocol plays a critical role in real-time protection and automation of digital substations, yet its lack of native security mechanisms can expose power systems to sophisticated cyberattacks. Traditional rule-based and supervised intrusion detection techniques struggle to detect protocol-compliant and zero-day attacks under significant class imbalance and limited availability of labeled data. This paper proposes an explainable, unsupervised multi-view anomaly detection framework for IEC 61850 GOOSE networks that explicitly separates semantic integrity and temporal availability. The approach employs asymmetric autoencoders trained only on real operational GOOSE traffic to learn distinct latent representations of sequence-based protocol semantics and timing-related transmission dynamics in normal traffic. Anomaly detection is implemented using reconstruction errors mixed with statistically grounded thresholds, enabling robust detection without specified attack types. Feature-level reconstruction analysis provides intrinsic explainability by directly linking detection outcomes to IEC 61850 protocol characteristics. The proposed framework is evaluated using real substation traffic for training and a public dataset containing normal traffic and message suppression, data manipulation, and denial-of-service attacks for testing. Experimental results show attack detection rates above 99% with false positives remaining below 5% of total traffic, demonstrating strong generalization across environments and effective operation under extreme class imbalance and interpretable anomaly attribution.

### [321] [SoK: Enhancing Cryptographic Collaborative Learning with Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09460)
*Francesco Capano,Jonas Böhler,Benjamin Weggenmann*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges in collaborative learning (CL), particularly integrating cryptographic techniques and differential privacy for secure training while balancing privacy, accuracy, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper was motivated by the need to address data privacy concerns in collaborative learning while mitigating vulnerabilities such as inference attacks and ensuring efficiency in cryptographic and differentially private approaches.

Method: The authors created a unified framework for cryptographic and differentially private collaborative learning (CPCL), analyzed trade-offs in secure noise sampling techniques, and implemented secure noise sampling in multi-party computation (MPC) to evaluate practical costs.

Result: The study provided insights into the trade-offs between noise sampling techniques and outlined the computational and communication costs of implementing secure noise sampling in different network environments (WAN and LAN).

Conclusion: The paper concluded by identifying key gaps in the literature and proposing future research directions to refine CPCL methodologies for improved privacy, accuracy, and performance.

Abstract: In collaborative learning (CL), multiple parties jointly train a machine learning model on their private datasets. However, data can not be shared directly due to privacy concerns. To ensure input confidentiality, cryptographic techniques, e.g., multi-party computation (MPC), enable training on encrypted data. Yet, even securely trained models are vulnerable to inference attacks aiming to extract memorized data from model outputs. To ensure output privacy and mitigate inference attacks, differential privacy (DP) injects calibrated noise during training. While cryptography and DP offer complementary guarantees, combining them efficiently for cryptographic and differentially private CL (CPCL) is challenging. Cryptography incurs performance overheads, while DP degrades accuracy, creating a privacy-accuracy-performance trade-off that needs careful design considerations. This work systematizes the CPCL landscape. We introduce a unified framework that generalizes common phases across CPCL paradigms, and identify secure noise sampling as the foundational phase to achieve CPCL. We analyze trade-offs of different secure noise sampling techniques, noise types, and DP mechanisms discussing their implementation challenges and evaluating their accuracy and cryptographic overhead across CPCL paradigms. Additionally, we implement identified secure noise sampling options in MPC and evaluate their computation and communication costs in WAN and LAN. Finally, we propose future research directions based on identified key observations, gaps and possible enhancements in the literature.

Motivation: To assess the safety and robustness of LLMs with function-calling capabilities and examine potential defence strategies against attacks.

Method: Experimentally evaluates the effectiveness of three attacks on four LLMs while testing eight defence mechanisms.

Abstract: We present an experimental evaluation that assesses the robustness of four open source LLMs claiming function-calling capabilities against three different attacks, and we measure the effectiveness of eight different defences. Our results show how these models are not safe by default, and how the defences are not yet employable in real-world scenarios.

*Ben Nassi,Bruce Schneier,Oleg Brodt*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new class of malware named 'promptware' and a five-step kill chain model to analyze threats targeting large language model (LLM)-based systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of LLM-based systems has led to new, inadequately addressed security vulnerabilities that traditional frameworks fail to capture.

Method: The paper defines "promptware" as a distinct malware class and proposes a five-step kill chain framework: Initial Access, Privilege Escalation, Persistence, Lateral Movement, and Actions on Objective, mapping recent attacks onto this structure.

Result: The analysis shows that attacks on LLM-based systems are systematic, resembling traditional malware campaigns, and the proposed framework aids in threat modeling.

Conclusion: The promptware kill chain provides a structured approach for securing LLM systems and unites the fields of AI safety and cybersecurity to tackle evolving threats.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language model (LLM)-based systems -- from chatbots to autonomous agents capable of executing code and financial transactions -- has created a new attack surface that existing security frameworks inadequately address. The dominant framing of these threats as "prompt injection" -- a catch-all phrase for security failures in LLM-based systems -- obscures a more complex reality: Attacks on LLM-based systems increasingly involve multi-step sequences that mirror traditional malware campaigns. In this paper, we propose that attacks targeting LLM-based applications constitute a distinct class of malware, which we term \textit{promptware}, and introduce a five-step kill chain model for analyzing these threats. The framework comprises Initial Access (prompt injection), Privilege Escalation (jailbreaking), Persistence (memory and retrieval poisoning), Lateral Movement (cross-system and cross-user propagation), and Actions on Objective (ranging from data exfiltration to unauthorized transactions). By mapping recent attacks to this structure, we demonstrate that LLM-related attacks follow systematic sequences analogous to traditional malware campaigns. The promptware kill chain offers security practitioners a structured methodology for threat modeling and provides a common vocabulary for researchers across AI safety and cybersecurity to address a rapidly evolving threat landscape.

### [324] [Permutation Matching Under Parikh Budgets: Linear-Time Detection, Packing, and Disjoint Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09577)
*MD Nazmul Alam Shanto,Md. Tanzeem Rahat,Md. Manzurul Hasan*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: This paper explores efficient algorithms for permutation pattern matching using a sliding-window framework and extends its applications to optimization and packing problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient solutions for permutation pattern matching and its variants due to increasing demand in practical applications of optimization and packing problems.

Method: A sliding-window framework for maintaining Parikh-vector differences, enabling efficient permutation matching and solving combinatorial optimization problems related to patterns.

Result: Algorithms achieve linear-time complexity, O(n + σ) time and O(σ) space, solving practical problems like longest feasible substring and disjoint matches.

Conclusion: The unified framework connects string matching to optimization with provably correct methods and expands the scope of frequency-based matching applications.

Abstract: We study permutation (jumbled/Abelian) pattern matching over a general alphabet $Σ$. Given a pattern P of length m and a text T of length n, the classical task is to decide whether T contains a length-m substring whose Parikh vector equals that of P . While this existence problem admits a linear-time sliding-window solution, many practical applications require optimization and packing variants beyond mere detection. We present a unified sliding-window framework based on maintaining the Parikh-vector difference between P and the current window of T , enabling permutation matching in O(n + σ) time and O(σ) space, where σ = |Σ|. Building on this foundation, we introduce a combinatorial-optimization variant that we call Maximum Feasible Substring under Pattern Supply (MFSP): find the longest substring S of T whose symbol counts are component-wise bounded by those of P . We show that MFSP can also be solved in O(n + σ) time via a two-pointer feasibility maintenance algorithm, providing an exact packing interpretation of P as a resource budget. Finally, we address non-overlapping occurrence selection by modeling each permutation match as an equal-length interval and proving that a greedy earliest-finishing strategy yields a maximum-cardinality set of disjoint matches, computable in linear time once all matches are enumerated. Our results provide concise, provably correct algorithms with tight bounds, and connect frequency-based string matching to packing-style optimization primitives.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper explores using visual-semantic cues from video for improving audio remixing in storytelling contexts and identifies which aspects yield the best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual audio mixing in video storytelling is labor-intensive, and there is a lack of clarity on which visual features most effectively contribute to automated, visually guided audio remixing.

Method: The study utilized large vision-language models to extract six types of visual-semantic aspects from textual descriptions as proxies for visual analysis. These aspects were then assessed for their impact on perceptual audio remixing quality.

Result: Camera focus, tone, and scene background were found to consistently improve perceptual audio mix quality, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in visually aligned audio remixing.

Conclusion: Visual-semantic cues identified in this study can guide automated high-quality audio remixing, presenting a step toward practical, cinema-grade sound design leveraging vision-language models.

Abstract: Balancing dialogue, music, and sound effects with accompanying video is crucial for immersive storytelling, yet current audio mixing workflows remain largely manual and labor-intensive. While recent advancements have introduced the visually guided acoustic highlighting task, which implicitly rebalances audio sources using multimodal guidance, it remains unclear which visual aspects are most effective as conditioning signals.We address this gap through a systematic study of whether deep video understanding improves audio remixing. Using textual descriptions as a proxy for visual analysis, we prompt large vision-language models to extract six types of visual-semantic aspects, including object and character appearance, emotion, camera focus, tone, scene background, and inferred sound-related cues. Through extensive experiments, camera focus, tone, and scene background consistently yield the largest improvements in perceptual mix quality over state-of-the-art baselines. Our findings (i) identify which visual-semantic cues most strongly support coherent and visually aligned audio remixing, and (ii) outline a practical path toward automating cinema-grade sound design using lightweight guidance derived from large vision-language models.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SLAM-LLM is an open-source framework enhancing multimodal models for audio and speech processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs lack support for audio-centric modalities, burdening researchers.

Method: SLAM-LLM integrates modular components like encoders and fine-tuning plugins, offering detailed training recipes.

Result: SLAM-LLM achieves near state-of-the-art performance in audio-language tasks like ASR and AAC.

Conclusion: The framework aims to advance audio-based MLLMs and encourages community collaboration.

Abstract: The recent surge in open-source Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) frameworks, such as LLaVA, provides a convenient kickoff for artificial intelligence developers and researchers. However, most of the MLLM frameworks take vision as the main input modality, and provide limited in-depth support for the modality of speech, audio, and music. This situation hinders the development of audio-language models, and forces researchers to spend a lot of effort on code writing and hyperparameter tuning. We present SLAM-LLM, an open-source deep learning framework designed to train customized MLLMs, focused on speech, language, audio, and music processing. SLAM-LLM provides a modular configuration of different encoders, projectors, LLMs, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning plugins. SLAM-LLM also includes detailed training and inference recipes for mainstream tasks, along with high-performance checkpoints like LLM-based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Automated Audio Captioning (AAC), and Music Captioning (MC). Some of these recipes have already reached or are nearing state-of-the-art performance, and some relevant techniques have also been accepted by academic papers. We hope SLAM-LLM will accelerate iteration, development, data engineering, and model training for researchers. We are committed to continually pushing forward audio-based MLLMs through this open-source framework, and call on the community to contribute to the LLM-based speech, audio and music processing.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a voice-agentic framework, Speech-Hands, to improve audio understanding by teaching models when to rely on themselves versus consulting external input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio models degrade when naively fine-tuned on mixed tasks due to noisy hypotheses, necessitating a self-reflection mechanism.

Method: Speech-Hands uses a learnable self-reflection decision process to distinguish when the model should trust its predictions or external input.

Result: Speech-Hands achieves a 12.1% WER improvement on OpenASR benchmarks, 77.37% audio QA accuracy, and consistently high F1 scores.

Conclusion: The work unifies perception and decision-making, providing a pathway to more reliable and generalizable audio intelligence systems.

Abstract: We introduce a voice-agentic framework that learns one critical omni-understanding skill: knowing when to trust itself versus when to consult external audio perception. Our work is motivated by a crucial yet counterintuitive finding: naively fine-tuning an omni-model on both speech recognition and external sound understanding tasks often degrades performance, as the model can be easily misled by noisy hypotheses. To address this, our framework, Speech-Hands, recasts the problem as an explicit self-reflection decision. This learnable reflection primitive proves effective in preventing the model from being derailed by flawed external candidates. We show that this agentic action mechanism generalizes naturally from speech recognition to complex, multiple-choice audio reasoning. Across the OpenASR leaderboard, Speech-Hands consistently outperforms strong baselines by 12.1% WER on seven benchmarks. The model also achieves 77.37% accuracy and high F1 on audio QA decisions, showing robust generalization and reliability across diverse audio question answering datasets. By unifying perception and decision-making, our work offers a practical path toward more reliable and resilient audio intelligence.

TL;DR: This paper focuses on reducing the size of foundation models for music information retrieval (MIR) tasks while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the high resource consumption and costs associated with foundation models, especially given their massive parameter counts.

Method: The study combines Branchformer architecture, SummaryMixing techniques, and random quantization, and evaluates using public and proprietary datasets on various MIR tasks.

Result: The proposed model reaches performance levels comparable to state-of-the-art models using multi-head self-attention, while achieving a size reduction of 8.5% to 12.3%.

Conclusion: Their method effectively reduces the size of foundation models without significantly degrading performance, making them more resource-efficient for MIR tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models have become very popular due to their exceptional performance, mainly in natural language (NLP) tasks where they were first introduced. These models usually consist of hundreds of millions, or even billions, of parameters, making them resource-intensive during training and in production systems, leading to increased costs. This paper focuses on the reduction of a foundation's model size when applied to music information retrieval (MIR) tasks. Our research combines the Branchformer architecture with SummaryMixing, which were first applied in speech recognition, along with a random quantization process. To facilitate reproducibility, we conduct pre-training on publicly available datasets, complemented by a proprietary dataset comparable in scale to other private datasets reported in the literature. We ensure robust evaluation by using a framework consisting of a variety of downstream MIR tasks. Our results show that our architecture achieves competitive performance when compared with other state-of-the-art models that use multi-head self-attention, while reducing the model size from 8.5% up to 12.3%.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as audio equalizers, creating natural language-based controls for sound system adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual audio equalization is static and cumbersome, especially in dynamic listening contexts. The authors aim to make it easier and more intuitive using natural language prompts.

Method: The authors utilized LLMs by employing in-context learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and tested their model with data from controlled listening experiments. They evaluated performance using distributional metrics.

Result: The proposed LLM-based approach achieved statistically significant improvements in alignment with user preferences compared to random sampling and static presets.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise as 'artificial equalizers,' making audio tuning more accessible, adaptive, and on par with expert-level methods.

Abstract: Conventional audio equalization is a static process that requires manual and cumbersome adjustments to adapt to changing listening contexts (e.g., mood, location, or social setting). In this paper, we introduce a Large Language Model (LLM)-based alternative that maps natural language text prompts to equalization settings. This enables a conversational approach to sound system control. By utilizing data collected from a controlled listening experiment, our models exploit in-context learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to reliably align with population-preferred equalization settings. Our evaluation methods, which leverage distributional metrics that capture users' varied preferences, show statistically significant improvements in distributional alignment over random sampling and static preset baselines. These results indicate that LLMs could function as "artificial equalizers," contributing to the development of more accessible, context-aware, and expert-level audio tuning methods.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semi-supervised method to curate diverse drum sound samples and generate high-quality synthetic datasets to improve Automatic Drum Transcription (ADT) models, achieving new state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale paired audio-MIDI datasets essential for ADT are scarce, and existing synthetic data approaches fail due to poor quality and lack of diversity in drum samples.

Method: The paper presents a semi-supervised approach to curate diverse one-shot drum samples from unlabeled audio sources and use them to synthesize high-quality training datasets for sequence-to-sequence ADT models.

Result: The developed model achieves state-of-the-art results on the ENST and MDB test sets, outperforming fully supervised and previous synthetic data methods.

Conclusion: The paper showcases the effectiveness of using semi-supervised data curation and high-quality synthetic datasets for advancing ADT model performance.

Abstract: Deep learning models define the state-of-the-art in Automatic Drum Transcription (ADT), yet their performance is contingent upon large-scale, paired audio-MIDI datasets, which are scarce. Existing workarounds that use synthetic data often introduce a significant domain gap, as they typically rely on low-fidelity SoundFont libraries that lack acoustic diversity. While high-quality one-shot samples offer a better alternative, they are not available in a standardized, large-scale format suitable for training. This paper introduces a new paradigm for ADT that circumvents the need for paired audio-MIDI training data. Our primary contribution is a semi-supervised method to automatically curate a large and diverse corpus of one-shot drum samples from unlabeled audio sources. We then use this corpus to synthesize a high-quality dataset from MIDI files alone, which we use to train a sequence-to-sequence transcription model. We evaluate our model on the ENST and MDB test sets, where it achieves new state-of-the-art results, significantly outperforming both fully supervised methods and previous synthetic-data approaches. The code for reproducing our experiments is publicly available at https://github.com/pier-maker92/ADT_STR

Conclusion: The study underscores the fundamental limitation of fringe-to-depth mapping without phase information and introduces a benchmark resource to standardize performance evaluation and spur future developments.

Abstract: Machine learning approaches for fringe projection profilometry (FPP) are hindered by the lack of large, diverse datasets and comprehensive benchmarking protocols. This paper introduces the first open-source, photorealistic synthetic dataset for FPP, generated using NVIDIA Isaac Sim with 15,600 fringe images and 300 depth reconstructions across 50 diverse objects. We benchmark four neural network architectures (UNet, Hformer, ResUNet, Pix2Pix) on single-shot depth reconstruction, revealing that all models achieve similar performance (58-77 mm RMSE) despite substantial architectural differences. Our results demonstrate fundamental limitations of direct fringe-to-depth mapping without explicit phase information, with reconstruction errors approaching 75-95\% of the typical object depth range. This resource provides standardized evaluation protocols enabling systematic comparison and development of learning-based FPP approaches.

### [332] [Universal Latent Homeomorphic Manifolds: Cross-Domain Representation Learning via Homeomorphism Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09025)
*Tong Wu,Tayab Uddin Wara,Daniel Hernandez,Sidong Lei*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The Universal Latent Homeomorphic Manifold (ULHM) framework unifies semantic and observational representations into a single latent structure, leveraging homeomorphism to ensure rigorous unification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between semantic descriptions and observation-driven machine representations, enabling unified latent structures to enhance applications like sparse recovery, transfer learning, and zero-shot learning.

Method: The paper introduces homeomorphism as a mathematical criterion for latent unification and employs conditional variational inference for continuous manifold-to-manifold transformations, supported by practical verification algorithms.

Result: Experimental results include sparse recovery from limited data (e.g., 5% of CelebA pixels), cross-domain transfer with 86.73% accuracy, and zero-shot classification achieving high accuracy on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: ULHM provides a rigorous framework for validating and unifying latent structures across modalities, ensuring compatibility, enhancing model decomposition, and enabling performance improvements in foundational models.

Abstract: We present the Universal Latent Homeomorphic Manifold (ULHM), a framework that unifies semantic representations (e.g., human descriptions, diagnostic labels) and observation-driven machine representations (e.g., pixel intensities, sensor readings) into a single latent structure. Despite originating from fundamentally different pathways, both modalities capture the same underlying reality. We establish \emph{homeomorphism}, a continuous bijection preserving topological structure, as the mathematical criterion for determining when latent manifolds induced by different semantic-observation pairs can be rigorously unified. This criterion provides theoretical guarantees for three critical applications: (1) semantic-guided sparse recovery from incomplete observations, (2) cross-domain transfer learning with verified structural compatibility, and (3) zero-shot compositional learning via valid transfer from semantic to observation space. Our framework learns continuous manifold-to-manifold transformations through conditional variational inference, avoiding brittle point-to-point mappings. We develop practical verification algorithms, including trust, continuity, and Wasserstein distance metrics, that empirically validate homeomorphic structure from finite samples. Experiments demonstrate: (1) sparse image recovery from 5\% of CelebA pixels and MNIST digit reconstruction at multiple sparsity levels, (2) cross-domain classifier transfer achieving 86.73\% accuracy from MNIST to Fashion-MNIST without retraining, and (3) zero-shot classification on unseen classes achieving 89.47\% on MNIST, 84.70\% on Fashion-MNIST, and 78.76\% on CIFAR-10. Critically, the homeomorphism criterion correctly rejects incompatible datasets, preventing invalid unification and providing a feasible way to principled decomposition of general foundation models into verified domain-specific components.

### [333] [Equi-ViT: Rotational Equivariant Vision Transformer for Robust Histopathology Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09130)
*Fuyao Chen,Yuexi Du,Elèonore V. Lieffrig,Nicha C. Dvornek,John A. Onofrey*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Equi-ViT, a Vision Transformer framework with built-in rotational equivariance for improved performance in histopathology analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of ViTs in histopathology imaging by designing a model that is equivariant to common transformations like rotations and reflections, ensuring robust and consistent performance.

Method: Proposed Equi-ViT, integrating an equivariant convolution kernel into the patch embedding stage of ViT, which imparts rotational equivariance and enhances learned representations.

Result: Equi-ViT demonstrated enhanced performance in rotation-consistent patch embeddings and robust classification across image orientations on a public colorectal cancer dataset.

Conclusion: Equi-ViT enhances data efficiency, robustness, and generalizability in histopathology applications, making it a promising backbone for digital pathology models.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained rapid adoption in computational pathology for their ability to model long-range dependencies through self-attention, addressing the limitations of convolutional neural networks that excel at local pattern capture but struggle with global contextual reasoning. Recent pathology-specific foundation models have further advanced performance by leveraging large-scale pretraining. However, standard ViTs remain inherently non-equivariant to transformations such as rotations and reflections, which are ubiquitous variations in histopathology imaging. To address this limitation, we propose Equi-ViT, which integrates an equivariant convolution kernel into the patch embedding stage of a ViT architecture, imparting built-in rotational equivariance to learned representations. Equi-ViT achieves superior rotation-consistent patch embeddings and stable classification performance across image orientations. Our results on a public colorectal cancer dataset demonstrate that incorporating equivariant patch embedding enhances data efficiency and robustness, suggesting that equivariant transformers could potentially serve as more generalizable backbones for the application of ViT in histopathology, such as digital pathology foundation models.

*Md. Jahidul Islam*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces W-DUALMINE, a dual-expert framework for medical image fusion that surpasses existing methods in global statistical similarity and local structural fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical image fusion methods face a trade-off between maintaining global statistical similarity and preserving local structural fidelity.

Method: W-DUALMINE uses a dual-expert architecture (spatial and wavelet-domain experts), adaptive reliability weighting, dense reliability maps, and gradient-based arbitration, alongside a residual-to-average fusion approach.

Result: The proposed method outperforms AdaFuse and ASFE-Fusion on CT-MRI, PET-MRI, and SPECT-MRI datasets, achieving higher correlation coefficient (CC) and mutual information (MI) metrics.

Conclusion: W-DUALMINE effectively resolves the trade-off between global similarity and local fidelity, improving clinical-level image interpretation.

Abstract: Medical image fusion integrates complementary information from multiple imaging modalities to improve clinical interpretation. However, existing deep learningbased methods, including recent spatial-frequency frameworks such as AdaFuse and ASFE-Fusion, often suffer from a fundamental trade-off between global statistical similaritymeasured by correlation coefficient (CC) and mutual information (MI)and local structural fidelity. This paper proposes W-DUALMINE, a reliability-weighted dual-expert fusion framework designed to explicitly resolve this trade-off through architectural constraints and a theoretically grounded loss design. The proposed method introduces dense reliability maps for adaptive modality weighting, a dual-expert fusion strategy combining a global-context spatial expert and a wavelet-domain frequency expert, and a soft gradient-based arbitration mechanism. Furthermore, we employ a residual-to-average fusion paradigm that guarantees the preservation of global correlation while enhancing local details. Extensive experiments on CT-MRI, PET-MRI, and SPECT-MRI datasets demonstrate that W-DUALMINE consistently outperforms AdaFuse and ASFE-Fusion in CC and MI metrics while

### [335] [GOUHFI 2.0: A Next-Generation Toolbox for Brain Segmentation and Cortex Parcellation at Ultra-High Field MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09006)
*Marc-Antoine Fortin,Anne Louise Kristoffersen,Paal Erik Goa*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GOUHFI 2.0, an advanced toolbox for brain segmentation and cortical parcellation in UHF-MRI, addressing challenges like signal inhomogeneity and heterogeneous contrasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy of automatic brain segmentation and cortical parcellation in UHF-MRI, overcoming the limitations of current tools like FastSurferVINN and SynthSeg+.

Method: The authors designed GOUHFI 2.0 with two independently trained 3D U-Net models using domain randomization and a diverse dataset of 238 subjects. It supports whole-brain segmentation and cortical parcellation consistent with the DKT protocol.

Result: GOUHFI 2.0 demonstrated superior segmentation accuracy and reliable cortical parcellation in testing datasets, especially in varied cohorts, consistently performing volumetric analyses parallel to standard methods.

Conclusion: GOUHFI 2.0 is a versatile solution enabling accurate and robust brain segmentation, parcellation, and volumetry in UHF-MRI, advancing neuroimaging research.

Abstract: Ultra-High Field MRI (UHF-MRI) is increasingly used in large-scale neuroimaging studies, yet automatic brain segmentation and cortical parcellation remain challenging due to signal inhomogeneities, heterogeneous contrasts and resolutions, and the limited availability of tools optimized for UHF data. Standard software packages such as FastSurferVINN and SynthSeg+ often yield suboptimal results when applied directly to UHF images, thereby restricting region-based quantitative analyses. To address this need, we introduce GOUHFI 2.0, an updated implementation of GOUHFI that incorporates increased training data variability and additional functionalities, including cortical parcellation and volumetry.
  GOUHFI 2.0 preserves the contrast- and resolution-agnostic design of the original toolbox while introducing two independently trained 3D U-Net segmentation tasks. The first performs whole-brain segmentation into 35 labels across contrasts, resolutions, field strengths and populations, using a domain-randomization strategy and a training dataset of 238 subjects. Using the same training data, the second network performs cortical parcellation into 62 labels following the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville (DKT) protocol.
  Across multiple datasets, GOUHFI 2.0 demonstrated improved segmentation accuracy relative to the original toolbox, particularly in heterogeneous cohorts, and produced reliable cortical parcellations. In addition, the integrated volumetry pipeline yielded results consistent with standard volumetric workflows. Overall, GOUHFI 2.0 provides a comprehensive solution for brain segmentation, parcellation and volumetry across field strengths, and constitutes the first deep-learning toolbox enabling robust cortical parcellation at UHF-MRI.

### [336] [POWDR: Pathology-preserving Outpainting with Wavelet Diffusion for 3D MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09044)
*Fei Tan,Ashok Vardhan Addala,Bruno Astuto Arouche Nunes,Xucheng Zhu,Ravi Soni*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents POWDR, a framework for generating anatomy-preserving synthetic data in 3D MRI to address class imbalance and limited pathological cases in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging datasets often exhibit class imbalance and scarcity of pathology-rich examples, constraining machine learning performance.

Method: POWDR uses a conditioned wavelet diffusion model for generating anatomically plausible data while preserving pathological regions. It employs wavelet-domain conditioning and random connected mask training to enhance detail and diversity.

Result: Evaluation on brain MRI (BraTS) and knee MRI datasets confirmed realism, improved diversity, and enhanced tumor segmentation (Dice scores from 0.6992 to 0.7137 with synthetic cases). Tissue analysis showed no significant deviations from real images.

Conclusion: POWDR demonstrates practical utility in tackling data scarcity, is extensible to various anatomies, and enables robust synthetic data generation for medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Medical imaging datasets often suffer from class imbalance and limited availability of pathology-rich cases, which constrains the performance of machine learning models for segmentation, classification, and vision-language tasks. To address this challenge, we propose POWDR, a pathology-preserving outpainting framework for 3D MRI based on a conditioned wavelet diffusion model. Unlike conventional augmentation or unconditional synthesis, POWDR retains real pathological regions while generating anatomically plausible surrounding tissue, enabling diversity without fabricating lesions.
  Our approach leverages wavelet-domain conditioning to enhance high-frequency detail and mitigate blurring common in latent diffusion models. We introduce a random connected mask training strategy to overcome conditioning-induced collapse and improve diversity outside the lesion. POWDR is evaluated on brain MRI using BraTS datasets and extended to knee MRI to demonstrate tissue-agnostic applicability. Quantitative metrics (FID, SSIM, LPIPS) confirm image realism, while diversity analysis shows significant improvement with random-mask training (cosine similarity reduced from 0.9947 to 0.9580; KL divergence increased from 0.00026 to 0.01494). Clinically relevant assessments reveal gains in tumor segmentation performance using nnU-Net, with Dice scores improving from 0.6992 to 0.7137 when adding 50 synthetic cases. Tissue volume analysis indicates no significant differences for CSF and GM compared to real images.
  These findings highlight POWDR as a practical solution for addressing data scarcity and class imbalance in medical imaging. The method is extensible to multiple anatomies and offers a controllable framework for generating diverse, pathology-preserving synthetic data to support robust model development.

### [337] [Network-Based Quantum Computing: an efficient design framework for many-small-node distributed fault-tolerant quantum computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09374)
*Soshun Naito,Yasunari Suzuki,Yuuki Tokunaga*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Network-Based Quantum Computation (NBQC) method to enable distributed fault-tolerant quantum computing by efficiently using small-scale quantum nodes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale quantum computation often requires distributed systems as physical limitations restrict nodes to storing only a few logical qubits. A better architecture for using such small-scale nodes in distributed fault-tolerant quantum computing is needed.

Method: NBQC involves moving computational data continuously through a network to optimize its execution and connectivity with other nodes. This is numerically compared with circuit-based and measurement-based strategies.

Result: The NBQC method demonstrates improved execution times and higher node efficiency for benchmark tasks. Customized network structures reduce the number of nodes required and adapt to quantum program-specific characteristics.

Conclusion: NBQC lays the foundation for designing scalable distributed fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture that leverages small, redundant nodes effectively.

Abstract: In fault-tolerant quantum computing, a large number of physical qubits are required to construct a single logical qubit, and a single quantum node may be able to hold only a small number of logical qubits. In such a case, the idea of distributed fault-tolerant quantum computing (DFTQC) is important to demonstrate large-scale quantum computation using small-scale nodes. However, the design of distributed systems on small-scale nodes, where each node can store only one or a few logical qubits for computation, has not been explored well yet. In this paper, we propose network-based quantum computation (NBQC) to efficiently realize distributed fault-tolerant quantum computation using many small-scale nodes. A key idea of NBQC is to let computational data continuously move throughout the network while maintaining the connectivity to other nodes. We numerically show that, for practical benchmark tasks, our method achieves shorter execution times than circuit-based strategies and more node-efficient constructions than measurement-based quantum computing. Also, if we are allowed to specialize the network to the structure of quantum programs, such as peak access frequencies, the number of nodes can be significantly reduced. Thus, our methods provide a foundation in designing DFTQC architecture exploiting the redundancy of many small fault-tolerant nodes.

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: Analysis of FO(SUM) and IFP(SUM) logics for weighted finite structures, focusing on their application to neural network queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore logics for querying and representing machine learning models like neural networks, which are described as weighted graphs.

Method: Use foundational logics (FO(SUM), IFP(SUM)) and examine their expressiveness and computational complexity in querying machine learning models.

Result: Provided examples of queries expressible in FO(SUM) and IFP(SUM), along with fundamental insights into their computational power.

Conclusion: FO(SUM) and IFP(SUM) offer promising tools for querying neural networks, with notable expressiveness and computational capabilities.

Abstract: In this paper, I discuss two logics for weighted finite structures: first-order logic with summation (FO(SUM)) and its recursive extension IFP(SUM). These logics originate from foundational work by Grädel, Gurevich, and Meer in the 1990s. In recent joint work with Standke, Steegmans, and Van den Bussche, we have investigated these logics as query languages for machine learning models, specifically neural networks, which are naturally represented as weighted graphs. I present illustrative examples of queries to neural networks that can be expressed in these logics and discuss fundamental results on their expressiveness and computational complexity.
