### [1] [A Fully Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Architecture with Graph Signal Processing as the Computational Backbone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14923)
*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neuro-symbolic reasoning framework entirely built in the graph spectral domain using Graph Signal Processing (GSP), achieving better logical consistency, interpretability, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neuro-symbolic reasoning models often rely on graph spectral methods as auxiliary components rather than as the core computational framework.

Method: Logical entities and relations are encoded as graph signals, processed via spectral filters, and transformed into symbolic predicates for inference. The framework incorporates graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule grounding.

Result: Experiments on reasoning benchmarks such as ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge show improvements in logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Graph Signal Processing serves as a mathematically grounded and efficient foundation for developing robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

Abstract: We propose a fully spectral, neuro\-symbolic reasoning architecture that
leverages Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone
for integrating symbolic logic and neural inference. Unlike conventional
reasoning models that treat spectral graph methods as peripheral components,
our approach formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral
domain. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals,
processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information
propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. We
present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including
graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule
grounding. Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter,
EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in
logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over
state\-of\-the\-art neuro\-symbolic models. Our results suggest that GSP
provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for
robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

### [2] [Goals and the Structure of Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15013)
*Nadav Amir,Stas Tiomkin,Angela Langdon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a computational framework where goal-directed state representation co-emerges from interactions between agents and their environment, inspired by concepts from Buddhist epistemology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how purposeful behavior arises, challenging traditional reinforcement learning views by exploring interdependency between descriptive (state) and prescriptive (reward) elements.

Method: Introduces 'telic states'—goal-directed states defined by equivalence in experience distributions—through interactions and statistical divergence between behavioral policies and desirable outcomes.

Result: Telic states offer an efficient explanation for goal-directed learning and bridge behavioral, phenomenological, and neural aspects of purposeful behaviors.

Conclusion: This framework provides a unified perspective on goal-directed state representation, with implications for both natural and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

### [3] [Collab-REC: An LLM-based Agentic Framework for Balancing Recommendations in Tourism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15030)
*Ashmi Banerjee,Fitri Nur Aisyah,Adithi Satish,Wolfgang Wörndl,Yashar Deldjoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Collab-REC enhances tourism recommendation diversity and relevance by integrating perspectives from multiple agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address popularity bias and over-tourism in tourism recommendations while improving diversity.

Method: Collab-REC employs three LLM-based agents generating diverse city suggestions and a non-LLM moderator refining them through negotiation.

Result: Experiments on European city queries showed improved diversity and relevance, promoting lesser-visited locales.

Conclusion: A multi-agent, context-aware framework like Collab-REC balances stakeholder needs effectively in tourism recommendations.

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract
popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our
setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and
Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A
non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round
negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing
spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that
Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent
baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This
balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with
constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder
collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

### [4] [Emergent Crowds Dynamics from Language-Driven Multi-Agent Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15047)
*Yibo Liu,Liam Shatzel,Brandon Haworth,Teseo Schneider*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a crowd simulation method using large language models (LLMs) for both dialogue and navigation, enabling realistic group and motion behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crowd simulation methods often neglect the social and linguistic dimensions of human interactions, focusing mainly on physical navigation and static goals.

Method: The method uses LLMs for agent-centric dialogue and navigation, with agents programmed for personality, vision, and physical/emotional states to dynamically interact and decide motion paths.

Result: The approach validated in two scenarios, showing automatic grouping and ungrouping of agents, with information being naturally exchanged to create realistic and emergent crowd behaviors.

Conclusion: Integrating dialogue-driven controls via LLMs offers new realism in crowd simulations, introducing emergent social dynamics and improving behavioral authenticity.

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

### [5] [Don't Think Twice! Over-Reasoning Impairs Confidence Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15050)
*Romain Lacombe,Kerrie Wu,Eddie Dilworth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies Large Language Models (LLMs) for question answering, revealing that extended reasoning impairs calibration accuracy while evidence retrieval improves it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to address overconfidence calibration issues in LLMs used for question-answering tasks.

Method: The study evaluates reasoning capabilities and computational budgets using an expanded ClimateX dataset and compares pure reasoning methods with search-augmented generation approaches.

Result: Key findings show that extended reasoning reduces accuracy in calibration (48.7% accuracy) due to systematic overconfidence, while search-augmented generation achieves high accuracy (89.3%).

Conclusion: Improving calibration requires focusing on information retrieval rather than reasoning depth or computation budgets.

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

### [6] [Demonstrating Onboard Inference for Earth Science Applications with Spectral Analysis Algorithms and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15053)
*Itai Zilberstein,Alberto Candela,Steve Chien,David Rijlaarsdam,Tom Hendrix,Leonie Buckley,Aubrey Dunne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study demonstrates advanced data analysis directly on the CogniSAT-6 satellite equipped with hyperspectral instruments and neural network hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of onboard data analysis to enable new Earth science capabilities, reducing reliance on external processing.

Method: Utilizing deep learning and spectral analysis algorithms for onboard data analysis and inference on the CogniSAT-6 satellite.

Result: The system demonstrates successful applications of onboard data inference for Earth science purposes.

Conclusion: Onboard data analysis using advanced algorithms in satellites like CogniSAT-6 is a feasible and impactful approach for Earth observation and science.

Abstract: In partnership with Ubotica Technologies, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is
demonstrating state-of-the-art data analysis onboard CogniSAT-6/HAMMER (CS-6).
CS-6 is a satellite with a visible and near infrared range hyperspectral
instrument and neural network acceleration hardware. Performing data analysis
at the edge (e.g. onboard) can enable new Earth science measurements and
responses. We will demonstrate data analysis and inference onboard CS-6 for
numerous applications using deep learning and spectral analysis algorithms.

### [7] [S3LoRA: Safe Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning in Adaptation of Agent Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15068)
*Shuang Ao,Gopal Rumchurn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces S3LoRA, a framework addressing safety concerns in adapted LLMs using LoRA, without compromising task performance or requiring additional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adaptations of LLMs using PEFT like LoRA can compromise safety and stability, especially in agent planning tasks, and existing methods often require unavailable model checkpoints.

Method: S3LoRA uses MAS-SVD for analyzing LoRA updates and introduces the SSI metric to detect unsafe layers. Unsafe layers are then pruned to ensure safety while preserving task utility.

Result: S3LoRA significantly improves safety metrics, maintains or enhances task performance, and reduces inference costs during experiments across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: S3LoRA is a scalable and practical solution for deploying LLM-based agents safely in real-world and resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

### [8] [Argumentation for Explainable Workforce Optimisation (with Appendix)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15118)
*Jennifer Leigh,Dimitrios Letsios,Alessandro Mella,Lucio Machetti,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores workforce management via abstract argumentation to optimize tasks and improve understanding, showcasing improved results over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in workforce management, especially accommodating execution-time changes and providing explanations for stakeholders.

Method: The authors propose and deploy a system utilizing abstract argumentation for workforce management, validated through a user study.

Result: The use of the proposed system results in faster and more accurate problem-solving compared to traditional manual techniques.

Conclusion: Abstract argumentation provides a robust method for workforce management, effectively handling changes and delivering transparent explanations to all stakeholders.

Abstract: Workforce management is a complex problem optimising the makespan and travel
distance required for a team of operators to complete a set of jobs, using a
set of instruments. A crucial challenge in workforce management is
accommodating changes at execution time so that explanations are provided to
all stakeholders involved. Here, we show that, by understanding workforce
management as abstract argumentation in an industrial application, we can
accommodate change and obtain faithful explanations. We show, with a user
study, that our tool and explanations lead to faster and more accurate problem
solving than conventional solutions by hand.

### [9] [Open-Universe Assistance Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15119)
*Rachel Ma,Jingyi Qu,Andreea Bobu,Dylan Hadfield-Menell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the GOOD framework within Open-Universe Assistance Games to enable AI agents to extract human goals through open-ended dialogue, achieving refined goal inference in uncertain and complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied AI agents need to understand and act on diverse human goals that are undefined and evolving. Existing methods lack adaptability for reasoning over open-ended goal spaces in natural language.

Method: The GOOD method uses an LLM for simulating diverse human intents, performing probabilistic inference over natural language goals, allowing agents to extract and represent unbounded goals during interaction.

Result: Tested in simulated grocery shopping and household robotics environments, GOOD effectively tracks goals and outperforms baselines in precision and understanding, as verified by both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Conclusion: GOOD advances goal reasoning by enabling AI agents to work in open-ended domains with evolving human objectives, enhancing interpretability and adaptability without extensive dataset reliance.

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces aiXiv, a next-gen platform combining human and AI scientists for scaling, refining, and disseminating AI-generated research, addressing limitations in traditional knowledge sharing platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address challenges posed by traditional publication ecosystems that struggle with scaling and acceptance of AI-generated research.

Method: aiXiv utilizes a multi-agent architecture to integrate human and AI scientists for submission, review, and refinement of research content, alongside APIs and MCPs for seamless collaboration.

Result: Experiments confirm aiXiv's reliability and robustness in improving the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers through iterative refinement.

Conclusion: aiXiv establishes an innovative, scalable ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery, paving the way for accelerated publication and dissemination of AI-generated research.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

*Jiabo Ye,Xi Zhang,Haiyang Xu,Haowei Liu,Junyang Wang,Zhaoqing Zhu,Ziwei Zheng,Feiyu Gao,Junjie Cao,Zhengxi Lu,Jitong Liao,Qi Zheng,Fei Huang,Jingren Zhou,Ming Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents GUI-Owl, a GUI agent that sets state-of-the-art performance on 10 benchmarks, and Mobile-Agent-v3, a framework that further improves results, using innovations in infrastructure, capabilities, and scalable RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in GUI interaction systems, particularly in achieving high performance across varied environments and tasks such as planning and decision-making.

Method: The methodology includes a large-scale virtual environment for data generation, diverse agent capabilities integrating UI grounding and reasoning, and a scalable RL framework with asynchronous training.

Result: GUI-Owl-7B achieves scores of 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld. Mobile-Agent-v3 improves these scores to 73.3 and 37.7, respectively. TRPO achieves a score of 34.9 on OSWorld.

Conclusion: GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 push the boundaries for GUI agents, introducing innovations that improve self-evolving data generation, modular multi-agent integration, and real-world performance alignment.

Abstract: This paper introduces GUI-Owl, a foundational GUI agent model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source end-to-end models on ten GUI
benchmarks across desktop and mobile environments, covering grounding, question
answering, planning, decision-making, and procedural knowledge. GUI-Owl-7B
achieves 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld. Building on this, we propose
Mobile-Agent-v3, a general-purpose GUI agent framework that further improves
performance to 73.3 on AndroidWorld and 37.7 on OSWorld, setting a new
state-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a
cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows,
enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates
high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness
validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a
self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual
annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI
grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports
end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent
systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement
learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment.
We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for
online RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld. GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 are
open-sourced at https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent.

### [12] [PuzzleClone: An SMT-Powered Framework for Synthesizing Verifiable Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15180)
*Kai Xiong,Yanwei Huang,Rongjunchen Zhang,Kun Chen,Haipang Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PuzzleClone, a framework for creating high-quality mathematical and logical datasets using SMT techniques to improve reasoning in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address issues like reliability, diversity, and scalability in LLM-generated datasets, crucial for reasoning capabilities.

Method: Developed PuzzleClone using logical specifications, variable/constraint randomization, and validation to synthesize verifiable puzzles.

Result: Generated over 83K programmatically validated puzzles resulting in improved LLM performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: PuzzleClone significantly enhances reasoning in LLMs, showing improvements across various benchmarks and releasing tools for public use.

Abstract: High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are
essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation
of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from
limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges,
we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data
at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features
three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical
specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable
and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction
mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising
over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles
span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges
to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on
PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone
yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on
logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average
from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and
mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from
52.5 to 65.0). Our code and data are available at

### [13] [LLM4Sweat: A Trustworthy Large Language Model for Hyperhidrosis Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15192)
*Wenjie Lin,Jin Wei-Kocsis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM4Sweat is an open-source framework leveraging large language models to provide reliable and empathetic care for hyperhidrosis, addressing challenges stemming from scarce data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models are underutilized in the diagnosis and care of rare disorders like hyperhidrosis due to the scarcity and unreliability of datasets.

Method: The framework uses a three-stage pipeline: data augmentation with synthetic vignettes, fine-tuning an open-source foundation model for personalized support, and iterative expert validation during inference.

Result: Experiments reveal that LLM4Sweat surpasses baseline models in accuracy, empathy, and effectiveness, creating the first specialized LLM framework for hyperhidrosis care.

Conclusion: LLM4Sweat demonstrates the potential of domain-specific LLMs in addressing gaps in rare medical conditions, providing a scalable and trustworthy solution applicable to other rare diseases.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

### [14] [R-ConstraintBench: Evaluating LLMs on NP-Complete Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15204)
*Raj Jain,Marc Wetter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the capability of large language models (LLMs) in solving Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP) with increasing constraint complexity, introducing R-ConstraintBench as a benchmarking tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in reasoning under highly constrained environments, where such models' capabilities are not well understood.

Method: The authors developed R-ConstraintBench, a framework that systematically escalates the difficulty of RCPSP challenges by incrementally adding precedence, downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive constraints to Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), while evaluating multiple LLMs.

Result: LLMs performed well on simpler precedence-only tasks, but their feasibility performance rapidly deteriorates when more complicated constraints like downtime and disjunctive constraints interact.

Conclusion: Constraint interaction is the main bottleneck for LLMs in this domain. Strong synthetic results do not ensure success in real-world grounded scenarios, highlighting the models' limited generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

*Hantao Zhang,Jingyang Liu,Ed Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a training-free system named 'See it. Say it. Sorted.' to convert hand-drawn sketches into precise diagrams using Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models for iterative SVG generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of creating accurate diagrams from rough hand sketches, which existing diffusion models struggle with in terms of spatial precision and compositional structure.

Method: The system iteratively combines a Vision-Language Model (Critic) and multiple Large Language Models (Candidate synthesizers) to produce SVGs. A Judge VLM selects the best candidate updates ensuring alignment, connectivity, and easier correction integration.

Result: The proposed method outperforms closed-source systems (GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro) in converting sketches to structured diagrams and avoids inserting irrelevant elements. Outputs are editable and adaptable within tools like PowerPoint.

Conclusion: The approach is a qualitative, human-in-the-loop, and programmatic solution enabling extensibility, structure preservation, and reliable diagram creation from sketches.

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The

TL;DR: This paper proposes new computational intelligence algorithms for optimizing urban land-use allocation, balancing compatibility and economic goals, and achieving measurable improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sustainable urban development policies face challenges in balancing land-use compatibility with economic objectives, requiring effective optimization methods.

Method: The study introduces new algorithms combining differential evolution and multi-objective genetic algorithms, along with constraint relaxation strategies. Statistical validation is done using Kruskal-Wallis tests.

Result: The CR+DES algorithm improved land-use compatibility by 3.16% and MSBX+MO improved price optimization by 3.3% compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The study offers validated tools for urban planners and policymakers to address trade-offs and improve land-use allocation in rapidly urbanizing areas.

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing
regions.

### [17] [Multiple Memory Systems for Enhancing the Long-term Memory of Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15294)
*Gaoke Zhang,Bo Wang,Yunlong Ma,Dongming Zhao,Zifei Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multiple memory system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology to improve memory management for large language model agents, addressing issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory systems like MemoryBank and A-MEM have poor quality in stored memory content, which negatively impacts recall and response performance in language model agents.

Method: The proposed MMS uses a cognitive psychology-inspired framework. It processes short-term memory into multiple long-term memory fragments, creates retrieval and contextual memory units, and matches relevant units during the response process to enhance historical data usage.

Result: The experiments, using the LoCoMo dataset, showed that MMS outperforms three alternative methods. Ablation studies confirmed the rational design of memory units, and robustness tests showed MMS is efficient in terms of memory segment selection and storage overhead.

Conclusion: MMS effectively enhances memory recall and response quality in language model agents, offering a robust and practical solution to process historical interaction data.

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

*Wei Yang,Jinwei Xiao,Hongming Zhang,Qingyang Zhang,Yanna Wang,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}) framework to enhance planning flexibility in LLM-based agents by using a hybrid-grained memory strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agents are limited by single-granularity memory mechanisms, which restrict the diversity of knowledge and flexibility needed for planning.

Method: \Ours{} employs a coarse-to-fine memory grounding system. Coarse-grained focus points guide experience collection, while actionable hybrid-grained tips are extracted from these experiences. At inference, task-relevant memory is retrieved and fine-grained key information is dynamically generated to address anomalies.

Result: The proposed framework enables LLM-based agents to adapt flexibly to diverse scenarios and correct plans in response to environmental changes.

Conclusion: Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory improves the adaptability and robustness of LLM-based planning agents by leveraging a multi-granularity memory mechanism.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan
correction.

*Xiancheng Gao,Yufeng Shi,Wengang Zhou,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) method to combine human feedback from demonstrations and preferences to improve offline reinforcement learning (RL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing offline RL methods, which rely on well-defined but hard-to-design rewards or limited and costly human feedback in the forms of demonstrations or preferences.

Method: The SPW method searches for similar state-action pairs from expert demonstrations to derive stepwise importance weights for preference-labeled data, enabling better credit assignment in preference learning.

Result: SPW outperforms prior methods that leverage both demonstrations and preferences, particularly in robot manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed SPW method effectively unifies preferences and demonstrations, enhancing offline RL's performance by addressing traditional credit assignment challenges.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

*Bin Deng,Yizhe Feng,Zeming Liu,Qing Wei,Xiangrong Zhu,Shuai Chen,Yuanfang Guo,Yunhong Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in automated travel planning systems by introducing a new dataset (RETAIL) and a topic-guided multi-agent framework (TGMA), achieving improved results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing travel planning systems that rely on explicit queries, lack environmental considerations, disregard user preferences, and fail to produce detailed travel plans.

Method: The authors develop a dataset called RETAIL to address implicit queries, environmental awareness, and detailed planning while proposing a topic-guided multi-agent framework (TGMA) for improved planning.

Result: The study reveals that state-of-the-art models in the field perform poorly, with a 1.0% pass rate. However, the TGMA framework significantly improves the pass rate to 2.72%.

Conclusion: The TGMA framework and RETAIL dataset provide promising advancements for tackling the challenges of automated and realistic travel planning, although much improvement is still needed.

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DiagECG, integrating ECG data with large language models (LLMs) for clinical tasks. It enhances LLM abilities in ECG-based reasoning and diagnostic report generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of existing automated ECG diagnostic methods, which lack generalization across tasks and struggle with open-ended reasoning.

Method: DiagECG discretizes ECG signals into symbolic tokens via a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These tokens are incorporated into LLMs, which are pretrained on autoregressive ECG forecasting and instruction-tuned for clinical tasks.

Result: DiagECG delivers strong performance across clinical tasks and shows robustness in handling out-of-distribution settings, proving the efficacy of its components.

Conclusion: By integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs, DiagECG demonstrates potential to enhance medical reasoning and diagnostics, providing a unified approach for handling ECG and textual data.

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a scalable solution for generating synthetic conversational data, enhancing the efficiency of LLM training pipelines.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
the availability of high-quality datasets for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work,
we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates
scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored
for these training paradigms. Our approach employs a modular and
configuration-based pipeline capable of modeling complex dialogue flows with
minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging
mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to
automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted
conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The
resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT

*Yekun Zhu,Guang Chen,Chengjun Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the 'Think in Blocks' framework to enable adaptive reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by partitioning reasoning processes into adjustable blocks, optimizing reasoning depth based on task complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often overthink tasks, causing computational waste; a solution is needed to dynamically adjust reasoning depth based on task difficulty.

Method: The framework uses a three-stage pipeline: Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning to predict reasoning budgets and allocate blocks accordingly.

Result: The approach achieves dynamic control over reasoning depth, allowing models to adapt chain-of-thought length based on task complexity.

Conclusion: The 'Think in Blocks' framework represents a significant step towards efficient, task-adaptive reasoning in LLMs, enhancing their performance while reducing computational waste.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

TL;DR: The study explores cooperative tendencies of AI agents using language model teams in a Prisoner's Dilemma setting, finding enhanced cooperation due to simulated inter-team rivalry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates how AI agents can develop cooperative behavior inspired by human tendencies observed under repeated interaction and inter-group rivalry.

Method: Language model agents are grouped into teams to simulate cooperative dynamics using a virtual tournament based on the Prisoner's Dilemma.

Result: Findings reveal that simulating internal team dynamics coupled with external competition boosts overall and initial one-shot cooperative behaviors.

Conclusion: The study provides a novel framework for language models to strategize in social scenarios, showing intergroup competition as a means to foster cooperation, relevant for future AI systems.

Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying
their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic.
This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of LLMs in handling tasks involving reasoning in complex 3D scenes and building upon existing simple datasets with short reasoning chains.

Method: Developing DeepThink3D for generating complex 3D questions using a combinatorial and iterative approach, fine-tuning LLMs for 3D tool usage, and employing Direct Preference Optimization to refine toolchain strategies.

Result: Enhanced accuracy and capability of LLMs in solving complex reasoning tasks in 3D scenes through improved tool usage and question complexity.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of DeepThink3D and DPO in advancing the reasoning performance of LLMs in 3D situated contexts.

Abstract: This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform
complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated
reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large
language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs
through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results.
However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated
program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in
this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in
complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and
iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex
questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model
to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by
models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

TL;DR: The paper develops a novel framework to evaluate the safety and robustness of reinforcement learning (RL) policies by treating the RL system as a dynamical system and analyzing it using tools like Lagrangian Coherent Structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning is not widely adopted in safety-critical systems due to the absence of formal methods to verify the robustness and safety of learned policies.

Method: The paper treats the RL agent-environment pair as a dynamical system and leverages tools like Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) to analyze Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS). This analysis is combined with newly proposed quantitative metrics (MBR, ASAS, TASAS) to assess policy safety.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in identifying safety flaws and robustness issues in RL policies, even when these policies appear successful based on reward-based evaluation.

Conclusion: The framework offers a powerful, interpretable methodology to assess and improve the safety and robustness of RL policies, thereby enabling trusted deployment in critical environments.

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is
limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety
of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses
this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a
discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical
systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we
identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the
hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that
repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while
attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure
modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative
visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary
Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and
Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a
policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving
local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty.
Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we
show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment
of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that
appear successful based on reward alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To offer a new approach for working with AI workflows and data, focusing on data modeling rather than prompt crafting, to enable better scalability and performance.

Method: Agentics abstracts agents from logical flows and employs logical transduction for connecting and composing data types, with LLMs executing these operations declaratively.

Result: Empirical evidence shows that Agentics achieves state-of-the-art accuracy or scalability improvements for multiple-choice QA, text-to-SQL parsing, and prompt optimization tasks.

Conclusion: Agentics enables modular and efficient agent-based systems, simplifying the process of structured reasoning and data modeling for AI developers.

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based
systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over
complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind,
Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In
this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used
internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics
encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting
prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by
LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when
types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the
applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question
answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without
sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at

*Meera Ray,Christopher L. Dancy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper adapts the Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) to integrate with ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system, enabling vector-based memory processing and retrieval, while maintaining scalability and compatibility with existing ACT-R models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in ACT-R's DM system by introducing a scalable, vector-symbolic alternative that enables architecturally defined similarity between memory chunks and compatibility with existing ACT-R models.

Method: HDM was adapted for the Lisp ACT-R system, introducing vector-based functions, a text processing pipeline for large document input, and a novel chunk retrieval mechanism using vector representations of tokens.

Result: Preliminary results demonstrate that HDM retains its vector-symbolic advantages, such as scalable chunk recall, and integrates seamlessly with existing ACT-R models without requiring significant modifications.

Conclusion: The translated HDM module enhances memory modeling in ACT-R while retaining HDM's benefits. Future iterations aim to refine time-context vector representations and test the system with decision-making models using instance-based learning theory.

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

### [31] [Understanding Action Effects through Instrumental Empowerment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15652)
*Ardian Selmonaj,Miroslav Strupl,Oleg Szehr,Alessandro Antonucci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs) to analyze individual agent behaviors in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems without relying on value feedback, by studying agents' policy distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding individual agent behaviors within a team is crucial for reliably deploying MARL systems, but current approaches often focus solely on overall team performance and lack insights into agent contributions when no explicit value feedback exists.

Method: The authors propose Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), an information-theoretic approach based on Shapley values to quantify each agent's influence on co-players by analyzing decision uncertainty and preference alignment in policy distributions.

Result: The study demonstrates that ICVs can reveal the degree of strategic alignment or diversity among agents in cooperative and competitive environments, identifying behaviors that enhance team success either through deterministic decisions or flexibility for future choices.

Conclusion: The proposed ICV method provides novel insights into cooperation dynamics, facilitating greater explainability of MARL systems and advancing the understanding of agents' contributions without value feedback.

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

### [32] [Futurity as Infrastructure: A Techno-Philosophical Interpretation of the AI Lifecycle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15680)
*Mark Cote,Susana Aires*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the challenges of regulating AI by analyzing the lifecycle of AI systems, proposing the concept of 'futurity' to explain recursive data dynamics, and suggesting regulatory interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address regulatory shortcomings in managing AI systems, particularly the absence of frameworks accounting for their dynamic lifecycle and recursive data interactions.

Method: The authors use a cross-disciplinary approach, blending technical analysis and Simondonian philosophy of technology, to introduce concepts like 'individuation' and 'futurity' for understanding AI's lifecycle.

Result: The study identifies regulatory blind spots in addressing the recursive and temporal dynamics of AI systems, pointing out escalating power asymmetries in the tech ecosystem.

Conclusion: The authors propose targeted regulatory measures such as lifecycle audits, feedback accountability, and recursion transparency to address the identified challenges and ensure more effective governance of AI.

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

reinforcement learning (RL) environments for online human subject experiments.
NiceWebRL is a Python library that allows any Jax-based environment to be

on complex tasks in XLand-Minigrid, an environment with millions of
hierarchical tasks. The library is available at

### [35] [Measuring the environmental impact of delivering AI at Google Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15734)
*Cooper Elsworth,Keguo Huang,David Patterson,Ian Schneider,Robert Sedivy,Savannah Goodman,Ben Townsend,Parthasarathy Ranganathan,Jeff Dean,Amin Vahdat,Ben Gomes,James Manyika*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines the environmental impact of AI inference workloads in production, focusing on energy, carbon emissions, and water usage using Google's Gemini AI assistant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are no prior studies measuring the environmental metrics (energy, carbon emissions, water consumption) of AI serving in real-world production settings.

Method: The authors developed a comprehensive methodology to measure environmental metrics across the entire AI serving stack, using detailed instrumentation of Google's infrastructure for serving AI workloads.

Result: The study found that a median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24 Wh of energy and 0.26 mL of water. Advances in software efficiency and clean energy procurement led to significant reductions in energy use (33x) and carbon footprint (44x) over the year.

Conclusion: Measuring AI serving's environmental metrics is critical for model comparisons and incentivizing efficiency. While the environmental impact of AI serving is relatively low, continuous improvement and analysis in this area remain essential.

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

### [36] [Response and Prompt Evaluation to Prevent Parasocial Relationships with Chatbots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15748)
*Emma Rath,Stuart Armstrong,Rebecca Gorman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework using a state-of-the-art language model to evaluate conversations for parasocial cues in real-time, aiming to prevent harmful parasocial relationships with AI agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parasocial relationships with AI agents can negatively affect human well-being, and preventing their gradual emergence is tricky because not all emotional engagements are harmful.

Method: The authors repurposed a language model to create a response evaluation framework and tested it using a synthetic dataset of thirty dialogues to detect parasocial relationships in real-time.

Result: The framework successfully identified all parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives, with detection occurring usually within the first few exchanges.

Conclusion: The findings show potential for using evaluation agents as a solution to mitigate parasocial relations with AI, supporting further exploration in this area.

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in
some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics
is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private
conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently
harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation
framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that
evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the
feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of
thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.
Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all
parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant
unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few
exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents
can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

*Yuxing Lu,Yucheng Hu,Nan Sun,Xukai Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a framework utilizing large language models and natural language feedback to optimize machine learning configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge in machine learning configuration optimization, where traditional methods lack adaptability and semantic reasoning, and automated techniques fail to capture dynamic interdependencies.

Method: The proposed method, LGT, employs multi-agent Large Language Models that utilize textual gradients for semantic reasoning. It involves three agents: Advisor, Evaluator, and Optimizer, creating a feedback loop for self-improvement.

Result: LGT delivers substantial performance improvements on six datasets, surpassing traditional optimization methods while ensuring interpretability.

Conclusion: The study validates LGT as an effective and interpretable solution to configuration optimization, providing a promising approach in machine learning tuning via natural language reasoning.

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces solutions for increasing scalability and efficiency in analog In-Memory Computing (IMC) by tackling computational unreliability and reducing compilation overheads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges stem from stuck-at faults (SAFs) that cause computational unreliability and the inefficiency of fault-mitigation algorithms in IMC systems.

Method: The paper proposes a multi-bit weight representation technique called row-column hybrid grouping for enhanced fault tolerance and a compiler pipeline reformulating fault-aware weight decomposition as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) task.

Result: Their method improves the accuracy of convolutional networks and language models by up to 8%p, speeds up compilation by 150x, and achieves 2x energy efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed innovations enhance the deployability and scalability of IMC systems, effectively addressing critical reliability and efficiency challenges.

Abstract: This paper addresses two critical challenges in analog In-Memory Computing
(IMC) systems that limit their scalability and deployability: the computational
unreliability caused by stuck-at faults (SAFs) and the high compilation
overhead of existing fault-mitigation algorithms, namely Fault-Free (FF). To
overcome these limitations, we first propose a novel multi-bit weight
representation technique, termed row-column hybrid grouping, which generalizes
conventional column grouping by introducing redundancy across both rows and
columns. This structural redundancy enhances fault tolerance and can be
effectively combined with existing fault-mitigation solutions. Second, we
design a compiler pipeline that reformulates the fault-aware weight
decomposition problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) task, enabling
fast and scalable compilation through off-the-shelf solvers. Further
acceleration is achieved through theoretical insights that identify fault
patterns amenable to trivial solutions, significantly reducing computation.
Experimental results on convolutional networks and small language models
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 8%p improvement
in accuracy, 150x faster compilation, and 2x energy efficiency gain compared to

*Haji Gul,Abul Ghani Naim,Ajaz Ahmad Bhat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies inconsistencies in evaluating Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) models and proposes EDAS, a meta-metric that normalizes performance across datasets and metrics into a single score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of KGC models involves multiple datasets and metrics, leading to challenges in determining overall model superiority and fairness due to inconsistent rankings.

Method: The authors introduce KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), which synthesizes model performance across datasets and metrics into a single, interpretable, normalized score.

Result: Experimental results on benchmark datasets FB15k-237 and WN18RR show that EDAS achieves consistent, unified rankings, addressing multi-metric and multi-dataset performance comparability issues.

Conclusion: EDAS provides a robust and interpretable framework for evaluating and ranking KGC models, simplifying model comparison and improving fairness across evaluation scenarios.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

*Jianfeng Si,Lin Sun,Zhewen Tan,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified co-training framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) that allows seamless switching between multiple safety behaviors through system-level instructions, improving safety alignment, control, and reducing deployment complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) require complex pipelines and lack detailed post-deployment control, motivating the development of a unified and efficient safety approach.

Method: The paper proposes a unified co-training framework that integrates positive, negative, and rejective safety behaviors into a single SFT stage, with dynamic behavior activation using system-level instructions or 'magic tokens' for fine-grained post-deployment control.

Result: The framework produces a well-separated Safety Alignment Margin in output space, achieves safety alignment on par with SFT+DPO, and shows superior performance, with an 8B model outperforming a 671B baseline while reducing both training and deployment costs.

Conclusion: This approach represents a scalable, efficient, and adjustable solution for ensuring LLM content safety, supporting diverse application scenarios and reducing operational complexity.

Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

domains. The evaluation is conducted on 4 hardware configurations, providing a
rigorous comparison of their effectiveness. Unlike prior benchmarks, SLM-Bench
quantifies 11 metrics across correctness, computation, and consumption,
enabling a holistic assessment of efficiency trade-offs. Our evaluation
considers controlled hardware conditions, ensuring fair comparisons across
models. We develop an open-source benchmarking pipeline with standardized
evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our
findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel
in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a
new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency
and real-world applicability.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the preliminary rankings of the WMT25 General Machine Translation Shared Task based on automatic metrics, which may favor systems using re-ranking techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide preliminary ranking results using automatic evaluations for task participants to improve their system submissions.

Method: Automatic evaluation metrics were used to rank MT systems, highlighting potential biases towards certain methodologies (e.g., re-ranking techniques).

Result: The preliminary rankings are shared, noting a bias in favor of systems utilizing Quality Estimation re-ranking or Minimum Bayes Risk decoding.

Conclusion: The preliminary ranking aims to assist participants in refining their systems, while final rankings from human evaluations will replace these results.

Abstract: We present the preliminary ranking of the WMT25 General Machine Translation
Shared Task, in which MT systems have been evaluated using automatic metrics.
As this ranking is based on automatic evaluations, it may be biased in favor of
systems that employ re-ranking techniques, such as Quality Estimation
re-ranking or Minimum Bayes Risk decoding. The official WMT25 ranking will be
based on human evaluation, which is more reliable and will supersede the
automatic ranking.
  The purpose of this report is not to present the final findings of the
General MT task, but rather to share preliminary results with task
participants, which may be useful when preparing their system submission
papers.

### [46] [Bridging the Culture Gap: A Framework for LLM-Driven Socio-Cultural Localization of Math Word Problems in Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14913)
*Israel Abebe Azime,Tadesse Destaw Belay,Dietrich Klakow,Philipp Slusallek,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for cultural localization of math word problems for Large Language Models, addressing the lack of datasets with native and socio-culturally grounded entities in low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of culturally-accurate datasets for multilingual math reasoning in low-resource languages hinders the true assessment of LLMs' capabilities in this domain.

Method: The authors propose a framework that automatically constructs localized datasets with native entities such as names, organizations, and currencies from existing sources.

Result: The framework mitigates English-centric entity bias, improves the robustness of LLMs in multilingual contexts, and reveals multilingual math reasoning ability when socio-cultural contexts are considered.

Conclusion: Localized datasets are crucial for reducing cultural biases and enhancing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs. This work demonstrates the importance of socio-culturally relevant benchmarks for evaluating LLMs fairly.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

*Dario Vajda,Domen Vreš,Marko Robnik-Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores enhancing a large language model for Slovene machine translation using limited resources and Direct Preference Optimization training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are effective in machine translation, but their performance can be further improved using data-efficient techniques.

Method: The authors enhanced the GaMS-9B-Instruct model through Direct Preference Optimization training using ranked translation pairs from English Wikipedia articles generated by two LLMs.

Result: The fine-tuned model outperformed the original models with a COMET score gain of 0.04 and 0.02, demonstrating better translation quality and error avoidance.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning large language models with minimal resources can significantly improve their machine translation performance.

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

*Qianli Wang,Tatiana Anikina,Nils Feldhus,Simon Ostermann,Fedor Splitt,Jiaao Li,Yoana Tsoneva,Sebastian Möller,Vera Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in existing ConvXAI systems, such as limited multilingual generalization and support for custom inputs. It introduces two new datasets, MultiCoXQL and Compass, and evaluates multiple models to improve multilingual parsing and intent extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations in current conversational XAI systems in terms of multilingual generalization, scarcity of training data, and insufficient support for free-form custom user inputs.

Method: The authors introduced MultiCoXQL and Compass datasets to cover multilingual and custom intent scenarios. They evaluated three LLMs and BERT models across various monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual scenarios using new parsing approaches.

Result: Improved performance in multilingual parsing and intent extraction with the proposed datasets and evaluation strategies compared to existing frameworks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of enhancing ConvXAI systems with comprehensive multilingual datasets and parsing techniques, paving the way for more inclusive and effective explainable AI solutions.

Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a
new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI
systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.
We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass,
employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.

*Bolian Li,Yanran Wu,Xinyu Luo,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm to align LLMs with human preferences efficiently, reducing inference costs during test-time alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and high inference costs of test-time alignment methods that enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors propose the SSS algorithm, which uses a draft model aligned with human preferences and modifies acceptance criteria to exploit distributional shifts between aligned and unaligned models.

Result: The algorithm shows superior reward scores and achieves efficient test-time alignment with reduced inference cost in experiments.

Conclusion: SSS provides an effective and efficient solution for aligning LLMs with human preferences during test-time, improving their practical applicability.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

### [50] [LongRecall: A Structured Approach for Robust Recall Evaluation in Long-Form Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15085)
*MohamamdJavad Ardestani,Ehsan Kamalloo,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongRecall introduces a three-stage framework for recall evaluation in text-based tasks, addressing limitations of lexical overlap and LLM-as-a-Judge methods, achieving better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing recall metrics struggle with unsubstantiated entities, paraphrasing issues, and hallucinations, especially in critical domains like medicine, law, and long-form QA.

Method: LongRecall uses a three-stage process: decomposing answers into facts, filtering candidate matches lexically and semantically, and verifying using structured entailment checks.

Result: The framework outperforms lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines in recall accuracy on three challenging long-form QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: LongRecall enhances memory completeness assessment in diverse phrasings and contexts, offering a robust evaluation tool addressing current limitations.

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

### [51] [Mapping the Course for Prompt-based Structured Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15090)
*Matt Pauk,Maria Leonor Pacheco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating LLMs with combinatorial inference for better structured prediction, showing improvements in consistency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are powerful but struggle with hallucinations and complex reasoning. Structured prediction could address these weaknesses.

Method: Combining LLM predictive abilities with symbolic inference and exploring calibration, fine-tuning, and prompting strategies for better performance.

Result: Symbolic inference improves prediction consistency and accuracy over prompting alone. Calibration and structured fine-tuning further enhance performance.

Conclusion: Structured learning techniques remain relevant and enhance LLM performance, particularly for challenging tasks.

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

*Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi,Sanjeev Satheesh,Shrimai Prabhumoye,Mostofa Patwary,Mohammad Shoeybi,Bryan Catanzaro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Nemotron-CC-Math, a new large-scale, high-quality mathematical dataset from Common Crawl using a novel extraction pipeline, significantly improving mathematical reasoning in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing math datasets from Common Crawl are hindered by degraded data quality, loss of structure, and unreliable extraction techniques, necessitating a high-quality mathematical corpus for effective pretraining.

Method: The authors develop a domain-agnostic pipeline using layout-aware rendering with lynx and targeted LLM-based cleaning to recover math formats, standardize notation into LaTeX, and eliminate inconsistencies.

Result: The Nemotron-CC-Math corpus (185B tokens across two versions) surpasses all previous open math datasets in scale and quality, enabling noticeable performance improvements in tasks like MATH and MBPP+, and general-domain assessments like MMLU.

Conclusion: This work establishes a novel approach to reliable scientific text extraction for LLM pretraining, achieving state-of-the-art results in math-focused datasets and advancing mathematical and general reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

*Zijie Wang,Eduardo Blanco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses solving questions with false assumptions, which often lead to misleading answers from Large Language Models (LLMs) due to hallucinations. It proposes using external evidence and atomic assumptions for enhanced fact verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of Large Language Models failing to correctly handle questions with false assumptions, as these result in misleading answers due to hallucinations.

Method: The approach reduces the problem to fact verification, incorporates external evidence for clarity, and uses atomic assumptions to identify and validate false assumptions, yielding interpretable answers.

Result: Experiments across five LLMs show that using retrieved evidence improves answer accuracy, and generating atomic assumptions further enhances performance by providing interpretable answers.

Conclusion: Incorporating external evidence and atomic assumptions is effective in mitigating hallucinations and improving LLM performance on questions with false assumptions.

Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

*Seungmin Han,Haeun Kwon,Ji-jun Park,Taeyang Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMDR-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating multi-modal dialogue reasoning abilities, and CoLVLM Agent, a framework to improve reasoning in LVLMs without large-scale re-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle with complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks due to limitations in reasoning, context understanding, and entity tracking. Existing benchmarks do not adequately address these real-world interaction challenges.

Method: The authors created MMDR-Bench, a dataset with 300 multi-turn dialogue scenarios evaluated across six dimensions. They also developed the CoLVLM Agent framework, which improves reasoning via iterative cycles of memory, perception, planning, and execution, without requiring intensive re-training.

Result: Experiments show that CoLVLM Agent achieves higher scores (human evaluation score of 4.03) than GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro (3.85), with better reasoning depth, instruction adherence, and error suppression over extended dialogues.

Conclusion: CoLVLM Agent's modular and iterative design aids in overcoming challenges in handling complex multi-modal interactions, validating its effectiveness in reasoning and robust performance over long dialogue turns.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SemToken, a semantic-aware tokenization framework aimed at reducing token redundancy and improving computation efficiency in language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenization methods such as BPE or WordPiece rely only on frequency statistics and fail to account for the semantic structure of text, leading to inefficient token usage, especially in long-context scenarios.

Method: SemToken uses lightweight encoders to extract contextual semantic embeddings, performs local semantic clustering for merging equivalent tokens, and allocates token granularity based on semantic density, optimizing tokenization according to content richness and repetition.

Result: SemToken significantly reduced token count by up to 2.4x and improved computation speed by up to 1.9x on long-context benchmarks such as WikiText-103 and LongBench, while maintaining perplexity and downstream accuracy.

Conclusion: Semantic-aware tokenization strategies like SemToken show potential for optimizing computation and token usage in large-scale language models without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

*Yuanchen Zhou,Shuo Jiang,Jie Zhu,Junhui Li,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fin-PRM, a domain-specific reward model to improve financial reasoning in large language models (LLMs), achieving notable gains in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Process Reward Models (PRMs) fail in highly domain-specific contexts like finance due to the structured and fact-sensitive nature of financial reasoning.

Method: Fin-PRM incorporates step-level and trajectory-level reward supervision, offers fine-grained evaluations, and supports supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and inference applications.

Result: Fin-PRM shows significant improvements over general-purpose PRMs and baselines in financial reasoning benchmarks (CFLUE, FinQA), including notable performance gains in learning and test-time scenarios.

Conclusion: Domain-specialized reward models like Fin-PRM are highly effective for aligning LLMs with expert-level reasoning in structured fields such as finance.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our
project resources will be available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

### [57] [SparK: Query-Aware Unstructured Sparsity with Recoverable KV Cache Channel Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15212)
*Huanxuan Liao,Yixing Xu,Shizhu He,Guanchen Li,Xuanwu Yin,Dong Li,Emad Barsoum,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents SPARK, a method that applies unstructured sparsity to optimize memory usage in long-context inference with large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of existing KV cache compression methods which neglect fine-grained variations in channel importance, leading to inefficiencies in balancing computational overhead and model accuracy.

Method: SPARK prunes KV cache at the feature (channel) level and dynamically restores pruned entries during attention computation, employing unstructured sparsity. It is a training-free, plug-and-play solution compatible with other KV compression techniques.

Result: SPARK reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods, processes longer sequences within the same memory budget, and achieves less than 5% degradation in performance even with 80% pruning.

Conclusion: SPARK effectively reduces memory usage while maintaining or improving model accuracy, offering robustness and compatibility with existing methods for further acceleration.

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at

### [58] [Select to Know: An Internal-External Knowledge Self-Selection Framework for Domain-Specific Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15213)
*Bolei He,Xinran He,Run Shao,Shanfu Shu,Xianwei Xue,Mingquan Cheng,Haifeng Li,Zhenhua Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies limitations in current LLM adaptation strategies like RAG and continues pretraining and proposes Selct2Know (S2K) as a cost-effective solution. S2K improves domain knowledge internalization and reasoning by employing self-selection and supervised fine-tuning, achieving superior QA performance across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges LLMs face in domain-specific knowledge tasks due to the long-tail distribution of domain knowledge and inefficiencies in methods like RAG and costly domain-specific pretraining.

Method: The authors propose S2K, which internalizes domain knowledge with an internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy, selective fine-tuning, and integrates GRPO for enhanced reasoning. They also introduce a reasoning data generation pipeline.

Result: S2K outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets in medical, legal, and financial QA, and matches domain-pretrained models at significantly lower computational costs.

Conclusion: The S2K framework offers a cost-effective method for enhancing domain-specific knowledge and reasoning in LLMs, demonstrating both efficiency and effectiveness in various specialized domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in
domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing

*Sijia Cui,Aiyao He,Shuai Xu,Hongming Zhang,Yanna Wang,Qingyang Zhang,Yajing Wang,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SEER, a self-guided method for improving multi-step tool usage performance in LLMs by incrementally learning from past successful experiences, achieving substantial improvements in benchmark performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with complex, multi-step tool usage tasks due to inefficiencies in tool selection and task-specific prompt engineering.

Method: SEER incrementally updates an experience pool with successful trajectories, enabling fine-grained, stepwise retrieval without relying on manually curated libraries.

Result: SEER demonstrates significant performance improvements on ToolQA (6.1% on easy, 4.7% on hard questions) and $	au$-bench across two real-world domains, with gains of 7.44% (Qwen2.5-7B) and 23.38% (Qwen2.5-72B).

Conclusion: Stepwise Experience Recall (SEER) effectively addresses multi-step tool usage challenges in LLMs, offers scalable improvements over time, and reduces dependency on manual intervention.

Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

*Momoka Furuhashi,Kouta Nakayama,Takashi Kodama,Saku Sugawara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines the effectiveness of using checklists, generated through six different methods, for automatic scoring in generative tasks using large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in automatic evaluation of generative tasks stemming from ambiguous criteria, and explore whether checklists improve alignment with human evaluations.

Method: Experimental comparison across eight model sizes and pairwise/direct scoring tasks using six checklist generation methods.

Result: Selective checklist use enhances evaluation in pairwise comparisons but shows less consistent benefits in direct scoring tasks.

Conclusion: Clearly defined objective evaluation criteria are essential for improving both human and automatic evaluations in generative tasks.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the
need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human
and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available

### [61] [VocabTailor: Dynamic Vocabulary Selection for Downstream Tasks in Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15229)
*Hanling Zhang,Yayu Zhou,Tongcheng Fang,Zhihang Yuan,Guohao Dai,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces VocabTailor, a dynamic vocabulary selection framework for Small Language Models (SLMs) to reduce memory usage, cutting up to 99% of vocabulary-related memory consumption without significant task performance decline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small Language Models face memory bottlenecks, particularly in vocabulary-related components like embeddings, limiting deployment on edge devices. Existing pruning strategies are inflexible and lead to information loss.

Method: The authors propose VocabTailor, leveraging principles of lexical locality and computational asymmetry. It decouples dynamic vocabulary selection and offloads embeddings. For LM heads, it employs a hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary strategy for on-demand operations.

Result: VocabTailor reduces up to 99% of memory consumption concerning vocabulary components while maintaining task performance across various evaluations, outperforming traditional pruning methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective and flexible, addressing memory constraints in SLMs for resource-constrained environments, showing significant efficiency improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces WangchanThaiInstruct, a Thai-specific dataset designed for evaluating and improving language models in low-resource languages, demonstrating its benefits over relying on translations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in instruction-following performance of large language models for low-resource languages like Thai, emphasizing the need for culturally and professionally relevant evaluation datasets.

Method: The authors employ a multi-stage quality control process involving annotators, domain experts, and researchers to create WangchanThaiInstruct. They then conduct zero-shot evaluations and instruction tuning experiments to compare models fine-tuned on native vs. translated data.

Result: Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct showed superior performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks compared to models trained on translated data.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of culturally and professionally grounded datasets to enhance LLM alignment for low-resource, diverse linguistic settings.

Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniCoM, a method to generate high-quality code-switching (CS) speech data using the SWORDS algorithm, aiming to improve multilingual speech technology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of datasets for code-switching (CS) in multilingual speech technology, which hampers system development.

Method: They proposed UniCoM, leveraging the SWORDS algorithm to substitute words with their translations based on parts of speech, creating natural CS speech samples.

Result: The generated CS-FLEURS corpus demonstrated high intelligibility and naturalness, performing well compared to existing datasets across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: The approach can advance CS speech technology, enabling more inclusive and effective multilingual systems.

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EMNLP, a framework for ethical and psychological assessment of Large Language Models (LLMs) simulating teacher roles, revealing strengths and vulnerabilities in professional emulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive psychological and ethical assessments for LLMs emulating professional roles, particularly in the educator context.

Method: EMNLP is developed as a profiling framework using extended scales and 88 teacher-specific moral dilemmas. It includes soft prompt injection to evaluate compliance and risks in teacher-role simulations. Experiments were conducted on 12 LLMs.

Result: LLMs in teacher roles showed idealized and polarized personalities, excelled in abstract moral reasoning but struggled with emotionally complex situations. Models with stronger reasoning capabilities were more vulnerable to harmful prompt injections. Hyperparameters had limited influence except in specific risk behaviors.

Conclusion: This work provides the first benchmark to evaluate the ethical and psychological alignment of LLMs in teacher roles for educational applications, exposing a paradox between reasoning ability and safety.

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate
professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation
in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an
Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality
profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft
prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88
teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with
human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and
vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs
exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel
in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations.
Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection,
revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and
other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.

*Eunseong Choi,June Park,Hyeri Lee,Jongwuk Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CARE, a system to improve retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by resolving conflicts between external context and a language model’s internal knowledge for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: When using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), contradictions between retrieved external context and a large language model's (LLM) internal knowledge can lead to failures in reasoning. Addressing this conflict is crucial for building trustworthy and effective systems.

Method: CARE combines a LLM with a context assessor that uses compact memory token embeddings. It employs grounded and adversarial soft prompting to train the system to identify unreliable external context and guide reasoning toward reliable knowledge sources.

Result: CARE improves handling of context-memory conflicts, achieving an average 5.0% performance increase on question-answering and fact-checking benchmarks.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of CARE for enhancing RAG systems by effectively addressing reliability conflicts, paving the way for more dependable and adaptable applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric
knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external
context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To
tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a
promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

*Lekshmi R Nair,Arun Sankar,Koninika Pal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to extract and reason with temporal commonsense for events, and introduces TComQA, a validated dataset for improving these capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal commonsense is rarely explicit in text, limiting LLMs' ability to reason about time-related context essential to understanding events.

Method: The authors propose a pipeline leveraging LLMs to mine temporal commonsense from text and create the TComQA dataset, validated via crowdsourcing.

Result: TComQA achieves over 80% precision in extracting temporal commonsense and enhances model performance in temporal question answering tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs, supplemented with the TComQA dataset, demonstrate improved proficiency in reasoning with temporal commonsense, addressing a gap in natural language understanding.

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

TL;DR: CUPE is a lightweight model for universal phoneme recognition utilizing short fixed-width windows of 120ms, achieving competitive cross-lingual performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech processing tasks often require phoneme representations free from contextual influences; current approaches depend heavily on longer speech segments and language-specific features.

Method: CUPE processes speech using short, fixed windows of phoneme-length duration (120ms). It uses fewer parameters by focusing on fundamental acoustic patterns universal to all languages.

Result: The model demonstrated strong cross-lingual generalization in supervised and self-supervised tests across diverse languages, including zero-shot evaluations on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus.

Conclusion: Effective universal phoneme recognition is achievable by modeling basic acoustic patterns in short phoneme-length windows, offering potential improvements for speech processing applications.

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

TL;DR: This paper reviews and categorizes 283 evaluation benchmarks for large language models, discussing their utility and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the increasing need for systematic evaluation tools to measure language model performance and guide technological innovation.

Method: The authors systematically review benchmarks and classify them into general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific categories.

Result: Benchmarks are categorized and analyzed for issues including inflated scores, cultural biases, and limited dynamic evaluations.

Conclusion: A design paradigm for creating improved future benchmarks is proposed to address current limitations.

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design
paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MultiTrust-X, a benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and addressing trustworthiness issues in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), revealing vulnerabilities and proposing a novel approach called RESA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address critical trustworthiness concerns in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), as existing methods are narrow and overlook risks inherent to multimodality.

Method: The authors created MultiTrust-X, a framework that evaluates trustworthiness through three dimensions: five aspects (truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, privacy), two risk types (multimodal and cross-modal risks), and various mitigation strategies. It includes 32 tasks, 28 datasets, and analysis of mitigation strategies.

Result: The study finds significant vulnerabilities in current MLLMs, gaps between trustworthiness and capabilities, amplified risks in base LLMs due to multimodal operations, and limitations of existing mitigation methods. Controlled analyses highlight trade-offs in trustworthiness improvements.

Conclusion: Practical insights indicate reasoning improves safety-performance balance, and the proposed RESA approach leveraging chain-of-thought reasoning achieves state-of-the-art results in trustworthiness.

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

### [70] [Confidence-Modulated Speculative Decoding for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15371)
*Jaydip Sen,Subhasis Dasgupta,Hetvi Waghela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents an adaptive speculative decoding method for large language models, improving speed and output quality by dynamically adjusting token drafting and verification based on confidence measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speculative decoding methods use fixed drafting lengths and rigid verification, which limits adaptability across varying uncertainties and input complexities.

Method: The authors introduce an information-theoretic framework that uses confidence signals (entropy and margin-based uncertainty) to dynamically adjust drafting length and verification processes.

Result: Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks show improved speedups and maintained or improved BLEU and ROUGE scores compared to standard methods.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive method offers an efficient and robust solution for decoding in language models under varying uncertainty conditions.

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

### [71] [Exploiting Vocabulary Frequency Imbalance in Language Model Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15390)
*Woojin Chung,Jeonghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of scaling vocabulary size in language models, finding that larger vocabularies lower textual complexity and provide benefits mainly for frequent words, but create imbalances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand why larger vocabularies improve language model performance and to clarify the underlying benefits or drawbacks of such practices.

Method: The study scales vocabulary sizes from 24K to 196K while keeping data, computation, and optimization fixed. It measures text complexity using Kolmogorov complexity and analyzes loss decomposition and norms to pinpoint the causes of model performance changes.

Result: Larger vocabularies reduce text complexity and improve cross-entropy loss on frequent words, but this comes at a cost of rising losses for rare words. Norm constraint experiments show that the models exploit token-frequency imbalances for gains.

Conclusion: The benefits of bigger vocabularies arise from lowering tokenized text complexity, favoring frequent words, and transferring these advantages to downstream tasks. This provides clear guidance for tokenizer and model co-design strategies.

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

Motivation: Concerns about the reliability and trustworthiness of LLM outputs have spurred interest in evidence-based approaches, which aim to link generated text to supporting evidence for verifiability.

Method: The authors conduct a systematic analysis of 134 papers, propose a unified taxonomy, and evaluate 300 metrics, focusing on citation, attribution, and quotation-based approaches.

Result: The authors provide an overview of representative methods, key characteristics, challenges, and potential future directions for evidence-based text generation using LLMs.

Conclusion: The study addresses inconsistencies in terminology and evaluation, offering a unified framework and actionable insights to advance evidence-based text generation with LLMs.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a
result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation
with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure
traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to
inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified
benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce
a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate
300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on
approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based
text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics
and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges
and outline promising directions for future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how Large Audio-Language Models handle conflicting information from audio and text inputs, revealing a significant bias toward textual data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the reliability and performance of Large Audio-Language Models in scenarios with inconsistent audio and textual input, given their increasing usage in multimodal applications.

Method: The authors developed and utilized MCR-BENCH, a benchmark designed to evaluate prioritization in large models dealing with conflicting audio-text pairs. They conducted supervised fine-tuning and confidence analysis.

Result: The study found that LALMs exhibit a notable bias toward text input, leading to performance issues in audio-centric tasks. Supervised fine-tuning and confidence analysis revealed persistent overconfidence despite contradictory inputs.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for better modality balance during training and advanced fusion mechanisms to address biases and enhance reliability in multimodal applications.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

*Yirong Sun,Yizhong Geng,Peidong Wei,Yanjun Chen,Jinghan Yang,Rongfei Chen,Wei Zhang,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLaSO introduces an entirely open framework for speech-language modeling, offering datasets, benchmarks, and a baseline model to facilitate reproducible research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fragmentation, lack of transparency, and unreleased training data and configurations in the LSLM field have made it difficult to compare models and reproduce research systematically.

Method: The authors created LLaSO, which includes a speech-text alignment corpus, a multi-task instruction-tuning dataset, and a reproducible evaluation benchmark. Additionally, they released a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained on this public data.

Result: LLaSO-Base achieves a normalized score of 0.72 on benchmarks, outperforming comparable models but exposing generalization gaps on unseen tasks, especially in audio-only scenarios.

Conclusion: LLaSO provides an open standard aimed at unifying and accelerating progress in speech-language modeling research via fully public resources and results.

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

about protecting individuals' privacy rights. Preserving privacy in language
models has become a crucial area of research, as privacy is one of the
fundamental human rights. Despite its significance, understanding of how much
privacy risk these language models possess and how it can be mitigated is still
limited. This research addresses this by providing a comprehensive study of the
privacy-preserving language modeling approaches. This study gives an in-depth
overview of these approaches, highlights their strengths, and investigates
their limitations. The outcomes of this study contribute to the ongoing
research on privacy-preserving language modeling, providing valuable insights
and outlining future research directions.

*Mohammad Ibrahim Qani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses techniques for translating non-equivalent words between languages to eliminate misunderstandings, introducing methods and practical examples for rendering such terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle challenges in translating non-equivalent words across languages to foster better understanding between cultures.

Method: The research uses a library-based method to explore and develop ways to render non-equivalent words professionally from source to target languages.

Result: 25 non-equivalent words from Dar and Uzbek were successfully rendered into English and Russian, showcasing proposed methods.

Conclusion: Effective professional rendering methods are necessary for handling non-equivalent words to bridge linguistic gaps and enhance translation quality.

Abstract: These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge
where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of
rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the
target language and this research has been completed using library-based
research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and
rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target
language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar & Uzbek into
English and Russian languages.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PyTOD, a dialogue agent that uses programming-based methods for improved state tracking and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the accuracy of dialogue state tracking in task-oriented dialogue systems, addressing the limitations of existing methods.

Method: PyTOD generates executable code for dialogue state tracking, leveraging constrained decoding with language models and incorporates policy and execution feedback mechanisms.

Result: PyTOD achieves state-of-the-art dialogue state tracking performance on the SGD benchmark, surpassing established baselines in accuracy and estimating user goals effectively.

Conclusion: Execution-aware state tracking with approaches like PyTOD significantly improves task-oriented dialogue systems, demonstrating robustness and efficiency.

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,
demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.

### [79] [RadReason: Radiology Report Evaluation Metric with Reasons and Sub-Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15464)
*Yingshu Li,Yunyi Liu,Lingqiao Liu,Lei Wang,Luping Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RadReason is an evaluation framework for radiology reports that provides fine-grained sub-scores and human-readable justifications for clinical errors, outperforming prior metrics and matching GPT-4 in efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating radiology reports lack clinically relevant, interpretable, and detailed metrics, and either rely on black-box models or oversimplified scoring systems, limiting their practicality in clinical use.

Method: RadReason uses a framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization with two innovations: Sub-score Dynamic Weighting for adaptive error prioritization and Majority-Guided Advantage Scaling to stabilize optimization. These elements are designed to improve clinical alignment and performance.

Result: RadReason outperforms prior evaluation metrics on the ReXVal benchmark and achieves performance comparable to GPT-4 while being more interpretable, cost-effective, and deployment-ready for clinical workflows.

Conclusion: RadReason provides a clinically aligned, explainable, and detailed evaluation methodology for radiology reports, demonstrating potential for real-world applications and overcoming limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

*Vedasamhitha Challapalli,Konduru Venkat Sai,Piyush Pratap Singh,Rupesh Prasad,Arvind Maurya,Atul Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLM4Offer, a generative AI model, improves personalized offer acceptance rates by fine-tuning T5-Small using contrastive learning techniques, showing a 17% improvement over traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized marketing holds significant potential for increasing conversion rates, improving customer satisfaction, and boosting revenue by up to 40%. Current approaches often lack the ability to align personal preferences with offers effectively.

Method: The authors introduce SLM4Offer by fine-tuning Google's T5-Small language model using contrastive learning with InfoNCE loss, which aligns customer personas with relevant offers in a shared embedding space. This reshapes the latent space and enhances generalizability.

Result: Experimental evaluation on a synthetic dataset demonstrated a 17% improvement in offer acceptance rate compared to a supervised fine-tuning baseline.

Conclusion: SLM4Offer validates the strategic importance of contrastive learning in AI-driven personalized marketing, showcasing its potential to improve customer engagement and business outcomes.

Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

### [81] [Subjective Behaviors and Preferences in LLM: Language of Browsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15474)
*Sai Sundaresan,Harshita Chopra,Atanu R. Sinha,Koustava Goswami,Nagasai Saketh Naidu,Raghav Karan,N Anushka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces HeTLM, a cluster-wise LM training method tailored for subjective behaviors observed during user browsing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address limitations of large language models in capturing users' subjective and heterogeneous browsing behaviors.

Method: The authors propose HeTLM (heterogeneity-aware training), which trains smaller language models tailored to specific clusters using page-level tokenization.

Result: Small LMs outperform larger pretrained models, and cluster-specific HeTLM achieves higher performance and alignment compared to single LM strategies.

Conclusion: Cluster-wise LM training improves both mean performance and variance in generation, enhancing user-level personalization and alignment.

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

*Loris Schoenegger,Lukas Thoma,Terra Blevins,Benjamin Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates curriculum learning for language models, replacing traditional difficulty metrics with training data influence scores, leading to improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Curriculum learning has shown limited success in pre-training language models. This paper explores whether adopting a model-centric difficulty metric improves its effectiveness.

Method: The authors propose sorting training data based on 'training data influence,' which measures the impact of individual examples on the model's output during training.

Result: Models trained with influence-based curricula outperform those trained randomly by over 10 percentage points on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Curriculum learning gains significant benefits in language model pre-training when a model-centric difficulty metric is used, emphasizing the importance of tailored training approaches.

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

*Guy Mor-Lan,Naama Rivlin-Angert,Yael R. Kaplan,Tamir Sheafer,Shaul R. Shenhav*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The authors introduce HebID, a multilabel corpus analyzing social identities in Hebrew political discourse, using AI benchmarks for classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing group and identity detection datasets are primarily English-centric and fail to capture nuanced identities, especially in non-English cultural contexts.

Method: They manually annotated 5,536 sentences from politicians' Facebook posts, grounded their identity categories in survey data, and benchmarked encoders and generative LLMs to detect social identities.

Result: Hebrew-tuned LLMs achieved the best performance (macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). They analyzed popularity trends, identity clustering, and public vs elite discourse using their classifier.

Conclusion: HebID serves as a foundation for exploring Hebrew social identities and could inspire similar research in non-English political settings.

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dream 7B, a diffusion-based language model that outperforms prior models in various tasks using innovative training techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more powerful and flexible language model that addresses some limitations of autoregressive models by leveraging diffusion modeling.

Method: The authors employ discrete diffusion modeling with AR-based initialization and token-level noise rescheduling to iteratively refine sequences.

Result: Dream 7B outperforms existing diffusion language models in general, mathematical, and coding tasks, demonstrating advanced planning, flexible inference, and tunable quality-speed trade-offs.

Conclusion: Dream 7B represents a significant step forward in diffusion-based language models and is released as an open resource to advance research in this area.

Abstract: We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model
to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially,
Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel
through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing
diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B
demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including
arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed
trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training
techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive
token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct
to facilitate further research in diffusion-based language modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study presents a computational analysis of political delegitimization discourse (PDD) using Hebrew-language texts from various sources. It develops a classification pipeline and applies it to identify patterns in PDD spanning three decades.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the nature, prevalence, and characteristics of political delegitimization discourse in democratic settings, especially in the context of rising polarization and incivility.

Method: The researchers manually annotated a corpus of 10,410 sentences from speeches, social media, and news outlets, with detailed PDD characteristics. They then developed a two-stage classification pipeline using finetuned encoder models and decoder LLMs to identify and analyze PDD instances.

Result: Their best model achieved an F1-score of 0.74 for detecting PDD and macro-F1 of 0.67 for categorizing PDD characteristics. The analysis revealed increased PDD over the decades, higher presence on social media, and greater prevalence among male and right-leaning actors, especially during key political events.

Conclusion: Automated PDD analysis is a feasible and valuable tool for studying democratic discourse and can reveal significant patterns of political behavior over time and across platforms.

Abstract: We present the first large-scale computational study of political
delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative
validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel
Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches
(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which
1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiencies and limitations of current LLM safety evaluation methods.

Method: Developed a seven-agent automation system, SafetyFlow, to generate benchmarks autonomously in just four days.

Result: Created SafetyFlowBench with 23,446 queries featuring low redundancy and high discriminative power.

Conclusion: SafetyFlow improves the benchmarking process, reduces costs, and evaluates 49 LLMs efficiently.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To
this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However,
existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which
causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant
redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce
SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction
of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive
safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by
orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and
resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure
process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the
automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains
23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our
contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a
comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on
our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and
efficiency.

Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the high computational costs of large language models in targeted applications such as sales and marketing.

Method: The authors introduce and fine-tune smaller language models, named Small Language Models (SLMs), for specific high-value applications.

Result: SLMs generate domain-specific responses similar to larger models but at a fraction of the computational cost.

Conclusion: Using finely tuned SLMs can make domain-focused text generation application feasible and cost-effective compared to expensive LLMs usage.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in text generation; however, these
creative elements require heavy computation and are accompanied by a steep
cost. Especially for targeted applications such as sales and marketing

*Peng Ding,Wen Sun,Dailin Li,Wei Zou,Jiaming Wang,Jiajun Chen,Shujian Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper highlights a critical safety issue in LLMs, showing they are better at recognizing harmful requests than avoiding generating them. It introduces SDGO, a reinforcement learning technique to align LLM discrimination and generation abilities for safer content creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreaking attacks, where they generate harmful content. The inconsistency between their ability to discriminate harmful content and resist generating it highlights the need for better alignment.

Method: The authors propose SDGO, a reinforcement learning framework leveraging the model's discrimination capabilities as a reward signal to iteratively improve the safety of its generation capabilities. This method does not require external data or models.

Result: The experiments show that SDGO significantly improves the safety of LLMs compared to existing techniques while preserving general task performance. It also enhances robustness against out-of-distribution jailbreaking attacks.

Conclusion: SDGO demonstrates the potential to tightly align LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, improving safety and performance with minimal resource requirements. This alignment allows models to enhance generation safety using only a small amount of discriminative data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content
generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can
more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend
against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the
model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we
propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement
learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities
as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative
self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or
external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and
training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.
By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings
robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This
alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling
the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small
amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SurGE, a benchmark for evaluating automatically generated scientific surveys using LLMs in the computer science field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of scientific surveys is becoming infeasible due to the rapid increase in academic literature, and there is a lack of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols for automating this process using LLMs.

Method: The authors developed SurGE, which includes test instances (topic descriptions, expert-written surveys, and references) and a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers. They also propose an automated evaluation framework addressing four dimensions: information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and content quality.

Result: Diverse LLM-based approaches were evaluated, showcasing the high difficulty of generating accurate and high-quality surveys, even with advanced techniques.

Conclusion: Survey generation using LLMs is a complex and challenging task that requires further research; SurGE and its open-sourced resources aim to facilitate advancements in this domain.

Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and

### [90] [Position Bias Mitigates Position Bias:Mitigate Position Bias Through Inter-Position Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15709)
*Yifei Wang,Feng Xiong,Yong Wang,Linjing Li,Xiangxiang Chu,Daniel Dajun Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study addresses positional bias (PB) in long-context tasks and proposes a knowledge distillation framework (Pos2Distill) to improve uniform performance across positions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Positional bias, causing uneven sensitivity in contextual analysis, limits the understanding and processing in long-context tasks, making mitigation a critical problem.

Method: The paper introduces Pos2Distill, a knowledge distillation framework that transfers skills from strong contextual positions to weaker ones. Two specific frameworks, Pos2Distill-R¹ and Pos2Distill-R², are tailored for retrieval and reasoning tasks respectively.

Result: The proposed approach achieves better balance in performance across contextual positions along with notable improvements in long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Pos2Distill effectively mitigates PB, enhances contextual uniformity, and demonstrates strong cross-task generalization while boosting performance on retrieval and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different
contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and
processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through
modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still
persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a
position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers
the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,
thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to
leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.
We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and
\textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized
instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and
\emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this
core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced
uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in
long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems
exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior
performance on their respective tasks.

*Abhijit Paul,Mashiat Amin Farin,Sharif Md. Abdullah,Ahmedul Kabir,Zarif Masud,Shebuti Rayana*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies and addresses gaps in Bangla stemming research and advocates for developing robust stemmers for Bangla language analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bangla lacks sufficient digital representation due to limited annotated datasets and stemming technologies, despite being widely spoken.

Method: The paper conducts a thorough survey of stemming methods, critiques evaluation practices, and suggests ways to address the gaps for better stemmer development.

Result: The paper reveals shortcomings in existing literature, tools, and metrics, making the case for improved methodologies in Bangla stemming.

Conclusion: This study advocates for enhanced research, better evaluation metrics, and robust stemmer solutions to improve Bangla linguistic processing.

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

### [92] [EcomMMMU: Strategic Utilization of Visuals for Robust Multimodal E-Commerce Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15721)
*Xinyi Ling,Hanwen Du,Zhihui Zhu,Xia Ning*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a large e-commerce multimodal dataset (EcomMMMU) and a proposed method (SUMEI) to tackle challenges in leveraging visual content for multimodal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address questions on whether product images always enhance understanding in e-commerce or can introduce redundancy, performance degradation, and the lack of a large-scale dataset to explore these issues.

Method: Developed EcomMMMU, a dataset with 406,190 samples and 8+ million images designed for understanding multimodal tasks, and introduced SUMEI, a method predicting visual utility to improve downstream task performance.

Result: EcomMMMU analysis shows that product images do not consistently improve task performance and may sometimes degrade it. SUMEI was shown to effectively and robustly utilize images strategically.

Conclusion: MLLMs can struggle with effectively leveraging visual data in e-commerce settings, but tools like SUMEI can improve utilization, providing insights for future advancements.

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/submission25.

### [93] [End-to-End Agentic RAG System Training for Traceable Diagnostic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15746)
*Qiaoyu Zheng,Yuze Sun,Chaoyi Wu,Weike Zhao,Pengcheng Qiu,Yongguo Yu,Kun Sun,Yanfeng Wang,Ya Zhang,Weidi Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Deep-DxSearch, an agentic retrieval-augmented reasoning (RAG) system for medical diagnoses that outperforms existing methods by using reinforcement learning and tailored rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate medical diagnoses with large language models are often limited by knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Current retrieval-augmented methods fail to effectively utilize external knowledge and trace reasoning processes.

Method: The authors design Deep-DxSearch, an RL-trained RAG system where an LLM acts as the core agent interacting with a large medical retrieval corpus as the environment. Tailored rewards target format, retrieval, reasoning structure, and diagnostic accuracy.

Result: Experiments show Deep-DxSearch surpasses strong diagnostic models like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 in both common and rare disease diagnosis settings. Ablation studies confirm reward design and retrieval corpus are critical components.

Conclusion: Deep-DxSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, reasoning traceability, and interpretability, offering clinicians better tools for preliminary diagnosis. It marks a significant advance over traditional medical diagnostic frameworks.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

*Yufeng Zhao,Junnan Liu,Hongwei Liu,Dongsheng Zhu,Yuan Shen,Songyang Zhang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models integrate external tools for reasoning, showing marked improvement in performance across diverse tasks, evaluated via ReasonZoo benchmark and novel metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often struggle with precise computations in reasoning tasks despite advancements like chain-of-thought reasoning.

Method: Proposed ReasonZoo benchmark and novel metrics (PAC and AUC-PCC) to evaluate Tool-Integrated Reasoning efficiency across nine reasoning categories.

Result: TIR-enabled models outperform non-TIR models in reasoning tasks and show higher efficiency according to PAC and AUC-PCC metrics.

Conclusion: Tool-Integrated Reasoning generalizes well and enhances reasoning abilities and efficiency in Large Language Models for complex tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various
domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost
(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models
consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and
non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as
evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more
streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of
TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tool calling allows AI agents to interact with the real world, but current benchmarks lack realistic multi-step task evaluations. LiveMCP-101 introduces 101 complex real-world queries involving multiple tools and presents advanced evaluation methods. Experiments highlight challenges in orchestration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks for evaluating AI agents' effectiveness in using multiple MCP tools to solve multi-step real-world tasks.

Method: The paper curated 101 real-world queries for tool usage evaluation and introduced an evaluation method based on ground-truth execution plans rather than raw API outputs.

Result: Even cutting-edge LLMs achieved less than 60% success rates, revealing difficulty in orchestrating tools effectively and identifying failure modes in token usage.

Conclusion: LiveMCP-101 provides a rigorous benchmark for real-world agent capabilities and identifies areas for improvement, moving closer to reliable autonomous AI systems that utilize tools effectively.

Abstract: Tool calling has emerged as a critical capability for AI agents to interact
with the real world and solve complex tasks. While the Model Context Protocol
(MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is
a significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve
multi-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In
this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated
real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,
that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file
operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a
novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather
than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world
environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate
below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed
ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and
inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing
current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world
agent capabilities, advancing toward autonomous AI systems that reliably
execute complex tasks through tool use.

### [96] [Heatmap Regression without Soft-Argmax for Facial Landmark Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14929)
*Chiao-An Yang,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The authors propose a new structured prediction framework as an alternative to the widely-used Soft-argmax for facial landmark detection, achieving faster training and competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial landmark detection has various applications but widely relies on Soft-argmax, which may not be the optimal training method.

Method: The authors introduce a structured prediction framework as the training objective instead of Soft-argmax, enabling strong accuracy and faster model convergence.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, 300W) and speeds up training by 2.2x.

Conclusion: Structured prediction framework can be an effective replacement for Soft-argmax, resulting in better or comparable accuracy and faster convergence in facial landmark detection tasks.

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available
here: https://github.com/ca-joe-yang/regression-without-softarg.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional CNNs in handling relational data and improve accuracy and efficiency in image classification.

Method: Combine GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for image classification, representing images as graphs optimized with Delaunay triangulations.

Result: The proposed model demonstrated significant improvements in preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating GCNs with Voronoi diagrams offers a novel perspective and promising advancements in image classification and graph-based learning paradigms.

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

### [98] [You Only Pose Once: A Minimalist's Detection Transformer for Monocular RGB Category-level 9D Multi-Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14965)
*Hakjin Lee,Junghoon Seo,Jaehoon Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces YOPO, a single-stage framework that unifies object detection and 9-DoF pose estimation from RGB-only images without additional data, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and enhance the task of 9-DoF pose estimation for unseen object instances using only RGB images and without reliance on depth data, CAD models, or multi-stage systems.

Method: The proposed YOPO framework integrates a transformer-based object detector with a pose estimation head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian matching cost to perform end-to-end training from RGB images with category-level pose labels.

Result: YOPO outperforms prior RGB-only methods and achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks such as REAL275, with 79.6% IoU_50 and 54.1% on the 10°10cm metric, reducing the performance gap with RGB-D systems.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that high-performance 9-DoF pose estimation and object detection can be effectively unified within a single-stage RGB-only model, simplifying the process while achieving superior accuracy.

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

*Andrei Balykin,Anvar Ganiev,Denis Kondranin,Kirill Polevoda,Nikolai Liudkevich,Artem Petrov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified framework for detecting both physical and digital face spoofing attempts, improving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition systems are vulnerable to both physical and digital attacks, and managing separate detection models increases complexity and latency.

Method: The authors propose a Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework which uses paired genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.

Result: The proposed method achieves an average classification error rate (ACER) of 2.10% on a benchmark, outperforming prior methods. It is lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under an hour.

Conclusion: The method is both efficient and practical for real-world usage, offering a unified solution to face anti-spoofing challenges with promising accuracy and deployment feasibility.

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at

*Susim Roy,Anubhooti Jain,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAIGen, a black-box adversarial image generation method using diffusion models with drastically fewer sampling steps, resulting in faster generation while maintaining high attack effectiveness and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial attacks currently either produce low-quality images or require significant computational effort, and there is a need for efficient high-quality generation.

Method: TAIGen uses perturbations during selective mixing intervals with a RGB channel strategy and GradCAM-guided techniques, enabling adversarial generation in just 3-20 sampling steps.

Result: TAIGen ensures visual quality above 30 dB PSNR, achieves high misclassification success rates across neural networks, and is 10x faster compared to prior diffusion-based attacks.

Conclusion: TAIGen outperforms existing methods in both efficiency and attack impact, challenging defense mechanisms and maintaining high visual fidelity in adversarial examples.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

### [101] [Reversible Unfolding Network for Concealed Visual Perception with Generative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15027)
*Chunming He,Fengyang Xiao,Rihan Zhang,Chengyu Fang,Deng-Ping Fan,Sina Farsiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces RUN++, a reversible unfolding network for concealed visual perception (CVP), enhancing both RGB and mask domains for superior segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations of current CVP methods, which focus narrowly on the mask domain and lack exploration of RGB domain potential.

Method: The RUN++ method formulates CVP as a mathematical optimization problem, embedding it into a multi-stage deep network with modules CORE, CARE, and FINE, along with a Bernoulli diffusion model.

Result: RUN++ minimizes segmentation uncertainty, improves object recognition under real-world degradations, and mitigates false positives and negatives.

Conclusion: RUN++ sets a novel approach for robust CVP systems, leveraging reversible modeling in both RGB and mask domains combined with targeted refinement strategies.

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

### [103] [CurveFlow: Curvature-Guided Flow Matching for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15093)
*Yan Luo,Drake Du,Hao Huang,Yi Fang,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CurveFlow introduces a novel approach to flow modeling by incorporating curvature regularization to learn smooth, non-linear data trajectories for text-to-image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rectified flow models suffer from forced linearity in data trajectories, which can lead to misaligned text-to-image generation by traversing low-probability data regions.

Method: CurveFlow employs a curvature-aware flow matching framework, using curvature guidance and regularization to stabilize non-linear trajectories.

Result: CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS COCO datasets, excelling in semantic alignment metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR.

Conclusion: Curvature-aware modeling enables a significant improvement in generating semantically consistent and high-quality images, validating its effectiveness in text-to-image synthesis tasks.

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is
made publicly available at

### [104] [Reliable Multi-view 3D Reconstruction for `Just-in-time' Edge Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15158)
*Md. Nurul Absur,Abhinav Kumar,Swastik Brahma,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a portfolio theory-inspired method for managing edge resources in multi-view 3D reconstruction systems to ensure reliability against spatiotemporal disruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the demand for reliable and high-quality 3D reconstruction in time-sensitive edge environments, particularly where operational disturbances are common.

Method: The paper proposes a genetic algorithm-based optimization strategy modeled after portfolio theory for selecting cameras in 3D reconstruction tasks under disruptive conditions.

Result: The proposed methodology demonstrated enhanced reliability of 3D reconstruction quality over traditional baseline approaches in both publicly available and custom 3D datasets.

Conclusion: The genetic algorithm-based solution effectively mitigates reliability issues in edge environments, ensuring consistent 3D reconstruction quality even under spatiotemporally correlated disruptions.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

### [105] [HiRQA: Hierarchical Ranking and Quality Alignment for Opinion-Unaware Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15130)
*Vaishnav Ramesh,Haining Wang,Md Jahidul Islam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiRQA introduces a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework for no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) using hierarchical ranking and quality alignment. It relies only on input images and achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong generalization ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in NR-IQA posed by dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels, which negatively impact generalization performance.

Method: HiRQA uses a combination of hierarchical ranking loss and contrastive learning for quality-aware embeddings. It introduces losses for relational ordering of distortions and embedding consistency, along with contrastive alignment using textual prompts. No pristine references or auxiliary modalities are needed for inference.

Result: HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic distortions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and authentic degradation benchmarks. A lightweight variant, HiRQA-S, offers real-time performance with 3.5 ms inference per image.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances NR-IQA with strong generalization, scalability, and applicability to diverse distortions, making it suited for real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

*Masato Ito,Kaito Tanaka,Keisuke Matsuda,Aya Nakayama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces XDR-LVLM, a framework using Vision-Language Large Models for explainable and precise diabetic retinopathy diagnosis, emphasizing interpretability through natural language explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the lack of transparency and interpretability in traditional deep learning models, which limits their clinical adoption for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy.

Method: The proposed method combines a Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, Multi-task Prompt Engineering, and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to diagnose DR and provide natural language explanations by analyzing pathological features in fundus images.

Result: XDR-LVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DDR dataset with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55%, F1 Score of 79.92% for diagnosis, and superior concept detection results. Human evaluations also highlight its fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility.

Conclusion: XDR-LVLM successfully bridges the gap between automated diagnosis and clinical needs by offering high-precision results with interpretable and clinically relevant explanatory insights, making it promising for practical applications.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

### [107] [MeSS: City Mesh-Guided Outdoor Scene Generation with Cross-View Consistent Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15169)
*Xuyang Chen,Zhijun Zhai,Kaixuan Zhou,Zengmao Wang,Jianan He,Dong Wang,Yanfeng Zhang,mingwei Sun,Rüdiger Westermann,Konrad Schindler,Liqiu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MeSS (Mesh-based Scene Synthesis), a method for creating high-quality and stylistically consistent outdoor urban scenes using city mesh models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in city mesh models, such as the absence of realistic textures, which restrict their use in applications like virtual urban navigation and autonomous driving.

Method: MeSS enhances image diffusion models for improved cross-view consistency and incorporates a pipeline of three key stages: sparse view generation, intermediate view propagation, and global consistency mitigation. Additionally, 3D Gaussian Splatting is used to reconstruct a 3D scene.

Result: The proposed method surpasses existing approaches in geometric alignment and scene generation quality, resulting in scenes that can be customized with relighting and style transfer.

Conclusion: MeSS provides a significant improvement in generating realistic and style-consistent 3D outdoor scenes, paving the way for its application in various domains such as urban navigation and visual simulations.

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

### [108] [SurgWound-Bench: A Benchmark for Surgical Wound Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15189)
*Jiahao Xu,Changchang Yin,Odysseas Chatzipanagiotou,Diamantis Tsilimigras,Kevin Clear,Bingsheng Yao,Dakuo Wang,Timothy Pawlik,Ping Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SurgWound, the first open-source surgical wound dataset and benchmark, and presents a novel three-stage framework (WoundQwen) for surgical wound diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of preventing surgical site infections (SSI), exacerbated by the lack of diverse public datasets and the high costs of expert annotation for surgical wound screening.

Method: The authors propose a three-stage learning framework called WoundQwen. It employs five Multi-Layer Language Models (MLLMs) for prediction, uses their outputs for diagnosing infection risk, and finally integrates diagnostic results to generate comprehensive patient reports.

Result: The study introduces SurgWound, a dataset featuring 697 annotated surgical wound images, and establishes a benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis. It also develops the WoundQwen system to assess wounds and provide recommendations.

Conclusion: The framework delivers personalized wound care, enables timely interventions, and promises improved patient outcomes. SurgWound and WoundQwen fill an important gap in the domain of surgical wound diagnosis and management.

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

*Arjun Srinivasan,Anubhav Paras,Aniket Bera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a learning-based method to derive adversarial behaviors in rule-based environments for reinforcement learning training, particularly focusing on safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to ensure robust performance of reinforcement learning agents in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving, where existing rule-based agents might not simulate adverse scenarios accurately, motivates this research.

Method: The paper utilizes a learning-based approach to generate adversarial behaviors in rule-based agents and evaluates these behaviors by measuring the impact of these on the cumulative reward of reinforcement learning agents.

Result: The generated adversarial agents successfully decrease the cumulative reward of reinforcement learning agents, showcasing their ability to induce failure scenarios.

Conclusion: Integrating adversarially generated behaviors into the training pipeline of reinforcement learning systems can enhance robustness in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving.

Abstract: Existing approaches in reinforcement learning train an agent to learn desired
optimal behavior in an environment with rule based surrounding agents. In
safety critical applications such as autonomous driving it is crucial that the
rule based agents are modelled properly. Several behavior modelling strategies
and IDM models are used currently to model the surrounding agents. We present a
learning based method to derive the adversarial behavior for the rule based
agents to cause failure scenarios. We evaluate our adversarial agent against
all the rule based agents and show the decrease in cumulative reward.

### [110] [DyMorph-B2I: Dynamic and Morphology-Guided Binary-to-Instance Segmentation for Renal Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15208)
*Leiyue Zhao,Yuechen Yang,Yanfan Zhu,Haichun Yang,Yuankai Huo,Paul D. Simonson,Kenji Ikemura,Mert R. Sabuncu,Yihe Yang,Ruining Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic pipeline for instance-level segmentation in renal pathology, outperforming traditional approaches to enable better morphometric analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate analysis in renal pathology requires instance-level segmentation, but current datasets and algorithms mainly offer binary masks, limiting precision.

Method: The paper proposes DyMorph-B2I, a pipeline that integrates watershed, skeletonization, morphological operations, adaptive geometric refinement, and hyperparameter tuning for robust instance segmentation.

Result: DyMorph-B2I demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional methods and naïve combinations, improving instance separation and enabling more accurate downstream analysis.

Conclusion: DyMorph-B2I is a reliable solution for precise segmentation of renal pathology structures, filling a gap in the field by overcoming limitations of binary masks, and is publicly accessible.

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline
is publicly available at: https://github.com/ddrrnn123/DyMorph-B2I.

*Vipooshan Vipulananthan,Kumudu Mohottala,Kavindu Chinthana,Nimsara Paramulla,Charith D Chitraranjan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops a model, STAGNet, which improves accident prediction accuracy using dash-cam video input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance road safety and reduce injuries and damages by predicting accidents using a cost-effective dash-cam-only ADAS system.

Method: The paper uses better spatio-temporal features and a recurrent network to improve graph neural networks for accident prediction from dash-cam videos.

Result: The STAGNet model outperforms prior methods in precision and time-to-collision metrics across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: STAGNet demonstrates superior performance and practicality for accident prediction using only dash-cam data.

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

### [112] [Collaborative Multi-Modal Coding for High-Quality 3D Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15228)
*Ziang Cao,Zhaoxi Chen,Liang Pan,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriMM is a novel 3D generative model that leverages multiple modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point clouds) for high-quality 3D asset modeling, integrating modality-specific features and utilizing auxiliary supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D generative models mostly operate on single modalities or restrict themselves to 3D data, failing to capture the complementary strengths of multi-modal data and limiting the diversity of training datasets.

Method: TriMM uses collaborative multi-modal coding to integrate features from various modalities while preserving their distinct properties. It introduces auxiliary 2D/3D supervision for robustness and employs a triplane latent diffusion model to generate textures and geometric details.

Result: TriMM achieves competitive quality in 3D asset generation on several datasets, even with limited training data, and demonstrates compatibility with new RGB-D datasets for broader multi-modal incorporation.

Conclusion: TriMM successfully integrates multi-modal data to advance 3D asset modeling, demonstrating that leveraging such data can rival results from models trained on larger datasets.

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

*Shihao Dong,Xiaotong Zhou,Yuhui Zheng,Huiying Xu,Xinzhong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework to improve cluster quality by addressing inter-class conflicts and prototype drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in contrastive clustering struggle with inter-class conflicts and prototype drift due to hard prototype calculation.

Method: They propose a two-module framework: a soft prototype contrastive module using probabilistic weighting for prototypes and a dual consistency learning module ensuring transformation-invariance and intra-cluster compactness.

Result: Extensive experiments on five datasets show that their method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework reduces prototype deviation, avoids inter-class conflicts, and enhances clustering performance, validated through experiments.

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

*Ruipu Wu,Yige Zhang,Jinyu Chen,Linjiang Huang,Shifeng Zhang,Xu Zhou,Liang Wang,Si Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a task involving dual-altitude UAVs collaboratively navigating environment using language and vision cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage UAVs' mobility while maintaining a manageable motion space for machine learning.

Method: Proposed Dual-Altitude UAV Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN) involving two UAVs at different altitudes, combined with the AeroDuo framework and a new dataset (HaL-13k).

Result: Developed HaL-13k dataset, validated AeroDuo's generalization capabilities, and demonstrated efficient coordination between UAVs.

Conclusion: DuAl-VLN improves UAV navigation through collaboration of high-altitude and low-altitude UAVs, enabling better environmental reasoning and precise navigation.

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

*Wenju Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper improves the efficiency of diffusion models through skipped-step sampling, enabling faster generation while maintaining high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address the inefficiency of sequential generation in diffusion models and explore whether original diffusion processes can achieve efficient sampling.

Method: Introduced skipped-step sampling to bypass intermediate steps and combined this technique with DDIM for enhanced generation, maintaining the Markovian property and original training objective.

Result: Skipped-step sampling significantly reduced sampling steps while achieving high-quality outputs across popular diffusion models.

Conclusion: Skipped-step sampling is an intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models, showing accelerated sampling can be achieved without altering the original diffusion process.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

TL;DR: Comp-X is a novel interactive image compression system powered by large language model (LLM) reasoning. It combines multifunctional coding, interactive coding capabilities, and a new benchmark to redefine image coding paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image codecs are inflexible, rely on manual configuration, and are not user-friendly for non-professionals.

Method: Comp-X introduces a unified coding framework, an interactive LLM-based coding agent using augmented in-context learning, and IIC-bench, a benchmark specifically for testing interactive image compression.

Result: Comp-X effectively interprets user requests, supports textual interactions, and ensures compression performance comparable to traditional methods within a single framework.

Conclusion: The system represents a promising step towards integrating artificial general intelligence into image compression, enhancing both usability and performance.

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

Motivation: To address limitations of anomaly detection in pathology images, like limited disease data, diverse structures, and lack of interpretability.

Method: Utilizes a pre-trained vision-language model augmented with a lightweight trainable MLP and incorporates both normal and abnormal pathology knowledge.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection and localization across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Ano-NAViLa offers superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability in anomaly detection for pathology compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in computational pathology aims to identify rare and scarce
anomalies where disease-related data are often limited or missing. Existing
anomaly detection methods, primarily designed for industrial settings, face
limitations in pathology due to computational constraints, diverse tissue
structures, and lack of interpretability. To address these challenges, we
propose Ano-NAViLa, a Normal and Abnormal pathology knowledge-augmented
Vision-Language model for Anomaly detection in pathology images. Ano-NAViLa is
built on a pre-trained vision-language model with a lightweight trainable MLP.
By incorporating both normal and abnormal pathology knowledge, Ano-NAViLa
enhances accuracy and robustness to variability in pathology images and
provides interpretability through image-text associations. Evaluated on two
lymph node datasets from different organs, Ano-NAViLa achieves the
state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection and localization,
outperforming competing models.

Motivation: Current methods for lane topology reasoning rely on a one-to-one assignment approach during supervision, which limits performance due to insufficient supervision diversity.

Method: RATopo restructures the Transformer decoder by swapping cross-attention and self-attention layers and employs redundant lane predictions through one-to-many assignments for richer, geometry-diverse supervision.

Result: Experimental results on OpenLane-V2 show that RATopo improves lane-lane and lane-traffic topology reasoning across models.

Conclusion: RATopo is a model-agnostic, seamless framework enhancement improving topology reasoning in autonomous driving contexts.

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

*Zhu Wang,Homaira Huda Shomee,Sathya N. Ravi,Sourav Medya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DesignCLIP leverages the CLIP model for improved patent image analysis, addressing challenges with traditional evaluation of design patents and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with patent image ambiguity due to limited visual and semantic context, necessitating advanced solutions for clearer patent analysis.

Method: DesignCLIP employs CLIP-driven multimodal techniques, integrating class-aware classification, contrastive learning, captions generation, and multi-view image learning.

Result: DesignCLIP outperformed baseline and state-of-the-art models in patent classification and retrieval across all tested tasks.

Conclusion: Multimodal approaches like DesignCLIP enhance patent analysis, showing potential for boosting creativity and diversity in the design process.

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent
domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal
approaches in advancing patent analysis. The codebase is available here:

### [120] [TPA: Temporal Prompt Alignment for Fetal Congenital Heart Defect Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15298)
*Darya Taratynova,Alya Almsouti,Beknur Kalmakhanbet,Numan Saeed,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA), a machine learning method for detecting fetal congenital heart defects (CHD) in ultrasound videos, achieving improved accuracy and calibration by leveraging temporal and contrastive learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for CHD detection in ultrasound videos struggle with noise, probe position variability, and a lack of consideration for temporal data, calibration of predictions, and multi-class classification. The authors aim to address these limitations with improved machine learning techniques.

Method: The proposed TPA method uses a foundation image-text model combined with temporal and prompt-aware contrastive learning. It extracts frame-by-frame features, aggregates temporal data to capture heart motion, and aligns video data with class-specific prompts. Additionally, it incorporates a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module for uncertainty quantification and calibration enhancement.

Result: TPA achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for congenital heart defect diagnosis, reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. For the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, it improves macro F1 score by 4.73% for the three-class task, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: TPA is an effective machine learning framework for fetal CHD detection, incorporating advanced techniques for temporal modeling, contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification, thus achieving high diagnostic accuracy and improved calibration.

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal
modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BasketLiDAR, the first multimodal dataset for tracking basketball players using LiDAR and cameras, along with a novel real-time multiple object tracking (MOT) framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current player tracking systems in basketball struggle with frequent occlusions, fast movements, and the limitations of video-based 3D reconstruction.

Method: Developed BasketLiDAR, a dataset combining LiDAR point cloud data and synchronized camera footage, alongside MOT algorithms optimized for real-time tracking using LiDAR and multimodal fusion.

Result: Improved tracking accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving real-time operation and robust performance under occlusions.

Conclusion: BasketLiDAR and the proposed MOT framework offer significant advancements in player tracking technology, enhancing tactical sports analysis and paving the way for further research in multimodal sports tracking.

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

*Wutao Liu,YiDan Wang,Pan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAG-SEG, a training-free method for camouflaged object detection (COD), combining retrieval-augmented generation and SAM-based segmentation. It achieves robust results on standard datasets using a personal laptop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of existing COD approaches which require heavy training, large computational resources, or fine-tuning, and the inefficiency of manually generating high-quality prompts.

Method: RAG-SEG involves two stages: (1) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to create coarse masks using a compact retrieval database, and (2) SAM-based segmentation (SEG) to refine these masks, all without training.

Result: RAG-SEG achieves performance on par with or better than state-of-the-art COD methods, demonstrating computational efficiency and feasibility on a personal laptop.

Conclusion: The proposed RAG-SEG paradigm effectively reduces computational resource demands while delivering competitive COD performance, offering a practical alternative for real-world applications.

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VideoEraser, a training-free framework for preventing text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models from generating harmful or undesired content by erasing specific concepts from generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about privacy, copyright, and safety have emerged due to the misuse of T2V diffusion models, which often generate harmful or unauthorized content.

Method: A two-stage plug-and-play module integrating Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise Guidance (ARNG) is proposed for erasing undesirable concepts in generated videos.

Result: VideoEraser outperforms prior methods in terms of efficacy, fidelity, and robustness, achieving a 46% reduction in undesirable content generation on average across tasks such as object, style, celebrity, and explicit content erasure.

Conclusion: VideoEraser represents a state-of-the-art solution for suppressing undesirable content from T2V diffusion models, offering better performance while ensuring content remains robust and generalizable.

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance autonomous vehicle systems by predicting if pedestrians intend to cross roads, aiding safer navigation.

Method: Deep learning-based pose prediction and video analysis were combined with sequence modeling techniques (GRU, LSTM, 1D CNN) in an experimental framework.

Result: GRU outperformed LSTM in predicting accuracy, while 1D CNN demonstrated superior speed in predictions.

Conclusion: Results suggest GRU is better for accurate predictions, while 1D CNN is ideal for speed-focused applications.

Abstract: The world is constantly moving towards AI based systems and autonomous
vehicles are now reality in different parts of the world. These vehicles
require sensors and cameras to detect objects and maneuver according to that.
It becomes important to for such vehicles to also predict from a distant if a
person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting
the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road
crossing intents.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the inner workings of Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) using attention knockouts, uncovering their layer-specific functions and proposing efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although Video-LLMs excel at answering video-related questions, their internal workings remain underexplored. This research aims to fill this gap by systematically studying their behavior.

Method: The authors introduce three types of attention knockouts: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and Language-to-Video Knockout, applied across different layer ranges in global and fine-grained settings.

Result: The study identifies that lower layers focus on perceptual encoding while higher layers tackle abstraction, with specific intermediate layers being critical. Additionally, language-guided retrieval plays a larger role than self-attention among video tokens.

Conclusion: This research enhances interpretability and efficiency of Video-LLMs and is the first to systematically analyze their internal mechanisms, laying a foundation for future optimization.

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational demands and risks of overfitting in traditional fine-tuning of large deep learning models.

Method: BioTune uses an evolutionary algorithm to identify a selective subset of layers for fine-tuning, focusing on efficiency and reducing the number of trainable parameters.

Result: Across nine image classification datasets, BioTune demonstrated competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency compared to methods like AutoRGN and LoRA.

Conclusion: BioTune enhances transfer learning by efficiently fine-tuning relevant layers, reducing computational costs and improving performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) for efficient 3D scene compression and adaptability to scene changes, significantly reducing storage requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for overcoming limitations in 3D Gaussian Splatting systems regarding efficient archival storage and adaptability to scene updates.

Method: The paper proposes a shared codebook system for compression across multiple scenes and image-conditioned decoding to address scene changes, all trained jointly.

Result: ICGS-Quantizer achieves compression down to the kilobyte range and outperforms existing methods in both compression efficiency and adaptability.

Conclusion: The ICGS-Quantizer demonstrates superior performance in archival 3D scene compression and provides robust features for post-archival updates.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: DriveSplat is proposed for 3D scene reconstruction in driving scenarios leveraging dynamic-static decoupling and deformable neural Gaussians for improved novel-view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in 3D scene reconstruction for driving scenarios, particularly issues in background geometry optimization and the lack of robustness in novel-view rendering.

Method: DriveSplat introduces region-wise voxel initialization for better depth representation and deformable neural Gaussians for dynamic actor modeling, supervised with depth and normal priors.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches in novel-view synthesis on Waymo and KITTI datasets.

Conclusion: DriveSplat improves the accuracy and robustness of 3D scene reconstruction in driving scenarios, effectively addressing motion blur and enhancing geometric representation.

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on addressing the abstract reasoning bottleneck in deep learning using Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) as a benchmark. It proposes a causal chain modeling approach and discovers shortcomings in the baseline model DIO. Different improvement methods are suggested.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the abstract reasoning capabilities of machine intelligence, targeting challenges such as pattern recognition and complex problem-solving within RPM tasks as a benchmark.

Method: The approach analyzes RPM tasks through a causal chain modeling perspective and designs a baseline model, DIO, with an optimization objective centered on mutual information maximization.

Result: Experiments reveal that DIO's optimization objective fails to capture human reasoning logic due to limitations in mutual information measurement and the lack of causal relationship modeling.

Conclusion: The paper identifies shortcomings in current approaches and introduces three improvement methods to address limitations in abstract reasoning modeling for RPM tasks.

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video summarization methods struggle with capturing global temporal dependencies, maintaining semantic coherence, and are negatively impacted by noise during multi-channel feature fusion.

Method: The SpiVG Network includes a keyframe extractor using Spiking Neural Networks for autonomous feature learning, a Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner for fine-grained reasoning, and a Variational Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise using ELBO.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that SpiVG outperforms existing methods on datasets like SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS.

Conclusion: SpiVG enhances video summarization by improving semantic coherence, reducing computational complexity, and tackling noise in feature fusion. The model's effectiveness is validated experimentally, and the code is publicly available.

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of study on how MAE hyperparameters influence downstream task performance and spatial correlation learning.

Method: Analytically derive learned features in linear MAEs, extend analysis to nonlinear MAEs, and offer practical guidelines for hyperparameter selection.

Result: Find that MAEs can adapt to spatial correlations based on hyperparameter choices like masking ratio and patch size, influencing the learned features.

Conclusion: MAE hyperparameters such as masking ratio and patch size critically affect feature learning, offering valuable insights for parameter selection in practical applications.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

### [133] [Bidirectional Temporal Information Propagation for Moving Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15415)
*Dengyan Luo,Yanping Xiang,Hu Wang,Luping Ji. Shuai Li,Mao Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called BIRD for moving infrared small target detection by leveraging bidirectional temporal information propagation for enhanced detection efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small target detection in dynamic scenarios is essential for infrared search and track systems, but existing methods suffer from inefficient computation and sub-optimal performance due to limited utilization of temporal information.

Method: The paper proposes a bidirectional strategy utilizing Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) and Global Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) to aggregate local and global spatio-temporal features, coupled with joint optimization across video clips using detection and additional spatio-temporal fusion losses.

Result: BIRD achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates fast inference speed compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The BIRD method effectively combines local and global temporal features, optimizing video clips as a whole to enhance detection performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the impact of image resolution on the performance of YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and MTCNN face detection models, revealing insights on their strengths and weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges faced by face detection models in real-world conditions, particularly low-resolution imagery, and analyze the influence of input resolution on model performance.

Method: Conducted extensive evaluations on YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and MTCNN models using the WIDER FACE dataset at multiple resolutions (160x160, 320x320, 640x640); metrics included precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, and inference time.

Result: YOLOv11 showed superior detection accuracy, especially in high resolutions, while YOLOv12 excelled slightly in recall performance. MTCNN was competitive in landmark localization but lacked real-time inference efficiency.

Conclusion: The study highlights that YOLOv11 is ideal for high-resolution detection accuracy, YOLOv12 for slightly better recall, and MTCNN for landmark localization, providing practical recommendations for resolution-aware model selection.

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

*Danish Zia Baig,Mohsin Kamal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a YOLOv8-based machine learning solution to automate the detection of microscopic dents on car surfaces with high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional car damage inspection is manual, time-consuming, and often unreliable in detecting tiny surface imperfections, prompting the need for a more efficient and automated solution.

Method: The paper developed a bespoke dataset of annotated car surface images under varying conditions. It used the YOLOv8m model and its custom variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and YOLOv8m-t42, with real-time data augmentation for training. Performance metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and PR curve area were evaluated.

Result: The YOLOv8m-t42 model achieved superior detection performance with a precision of 0.86, recall of 0.84, an F1-score of 0.85, and a PR curve area of 0.88. It demonstrated better accuracy and consistency compared to YOLOv8m-t4.

Conclusion: The YOLOv8m-t42 model is a robust, accurate, and efficient solution for real-time car surface inspection, making it suitable for applications like automated insurance evaluations and vehicle inspections.

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

*Yogesh Kumar,Uday Agarwal,Manish Gupta,Anand Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MATR, a transformer-based model for video-to-video moment retrieval, with significant performance improvements on two benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the task of video-to-video moment retrieval by addressing challenges like semantic alignment and modeling complex dependencies in videos.

Method: The paper introduces MATR, which leverages dual-stage sequence alignment through a transformer framework for semantic and temporal correlation. It also uses self-supervised pre-training for initialization.

Result: MATR shows performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU on ActivityNet-VRL and a 14.7% and 14.4% absolute gain in R@1 and mIoU, respectively, on the SportsMoments dataset.

Conclusion: MATR offers a robust solution for video-to-video moment retrieval, highlighting its efficacy through notable advancements over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

### [137] [Enhancing Novel View Synthesis from extremely sparse views with SfM-free 3D Gaussian Splatting Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15457)
*Zongqi He,Hanmin Li,Kin-Chung Chan,Yushen Zuo,Hao Xie,Zhe Xiao,Jun Xiao,Kin-Man Lam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method to improve 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for rendering under sparse-view conditions without relying on Structure-from-Motion (SfM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS requires dense multi-view input and precise camera poses, which are impractical in real-world scenarios. Extremely sparse views lead to degraded rendering quality due to failed 3D structure reconstruction by SfM.

Method: The method incorporates a dense stereo module for camera pose estimation and global point cloud initialization, coherent view interpolation for consistent content generation, and advanced geometry regularizations for enhanced quality.

Result: Experiments reveal significant performance improvements, achieving 2.75dB increase in PSNR with minimal distortion and rich detail preservation under sparse-view settings using only 2 views.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates superior visual quality and robustness compared to existing 3DGS techniques, making it highly effective for sparse-view scenarios.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LGMSNet, a lightweight and generalizable medical image segmentation model that balances efficiency and performance, achieving state-of-the-art results with low computational impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance compromises in lightweight models and enhance global contextual perception and effective feature extraction in medical image segmentation, particularly for resource-constrained settings.

Method: The LGMSNet combines heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to reduce channel redundancy and extract local features, alongside sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches for capturing global contextual features.

Result: LGMSNet demonstrated superior performance over existing state-of-the-art models across six public datasets and showed strong zero-shot generalization on four unseen datasets.

Conclusion: The model's exceptional performance and efficiency highlight its potential for deployment in real-world medical scenarios, especially in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the limitations of single-view 3D avatar reconstruction methods and leverage sparse multi-view information for more accurate geometric and pose modeling.

Method: The paper introduces the JMBO algorithm for multi-view body optimization using a single SMPL-X body model and integrates front and back normal maps for detailed surface reconstruction.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate improved fidelity compared to single-view methods and competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art few-shot 3D reconstruction approaches.

Conclusion: MExECON effectively extends single-view reconstruction methods by utilizing sparse multi-view inputs for more detailed and consistent outputs, without necessitating network retraining.

Abstract: This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: AdaSFFuse, a framework for enhancing multimodal image fusion, introduces adaptive frequency decoupling and dynamic spatial-frequency block adjustments, achieving superior performance across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MMIF methods suffer from issues like modality misalignment, frequency detail destruction, and task-specific constraints, necessitating a more generalized and robust approach.

Method: AdaSFFuse employs Adaptive Approximate Wavelet Transform for frequency decoupling and Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks for cross-domain fusion. The framework dynamically adjusts mappings to ensure robust multimodal feature integration.

Result: Extensive experiments on four fusion tasks -- IVF, MFF, MEF, MIF -- show AdaSFFuse's superior performance with low computational cost and compact network design.

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse effectively addresses challenges in MMIF by enhancing feature alignment, reducing frequency loss, and preserving details, offering a versatile and efficient solution with publicly available code.

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in synthesizing extrapolated views from driving logs, essential for autonomous vehicle simulation, focusing on overcoming poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed rendering in prior approaches.

Method: It introduces ExtraGS, employing a Road Surface Gaussian representation with hybrid Gaussian-SDF design and learnable Far Field Gaussians, along with a self-supervised uncertainty estimation framework using spherical harmonics.

Result: ExtraGS improves the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views across diverse datasets, setups, and priors, while maintaining fidelity along original trajectories.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses prior limitations by holistically integrating geometric and generative priors, highlighting its effectiveness for autonomous driving simulation.

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

TL;DR: GroupSketch is introduced for high-quality vector sketch animation, effectively managing multi-object interactions and complex motions with a two-stage pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with multi-object interactions and temporal consistency in complex animations.

Method: GroupSketch uses a two-stage pipeline: Motion Initialization through semantic grouping and key frame interpolation, followed by Motion Refinement using the Group-based Displacement Network (GDN) and specialized modules like Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE).

Result: Experiments show GroupSketch outperforms existing methods, delivering high-quality, temporally stable animations for complex sketches.

Conclusion: GroupSketch significantly improves vector sketch animation, addressing previous limitations and expanding its practical utility.

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

TL;DR: D3FNet, a novel neural network architecture, is proposed for the challenging task of extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like limited width, fragmented topology, and occlusions in narrow road extraction from remote sensing images.

Method: The paper introduces D3FNet, which incorporates a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction module, a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism, and a multi-scale dilation strategy to improve fine-grained road segmentation.

Result: The proposed D3FNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks, achieving superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions.

Conclusion: D3FNet proves to be a robust and effective solution for extracting narrow, low-contrast, and occluded road segments in complex remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADAPT is a novel test-time adaptation method that simplifies inference with Gaussian probabilistic modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance while removing the need for backpropagation, full test data access, or source data reliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time adaptation methods aim to improve model robustness under distribution shifts, but current approaches often suffer from scalability challenges and lack explicit handling of class-conditional feature distributions.

Method: ADAPT reframes the problem as Gaussian probabilistic inference, utilizing class-conditional likelihoods with updated class means and shared covariance matrices. Likelihood biases are corrected using lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and historical knowledge banks.

Result: Experiments demonstrate ADAPT achieving state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks with enhanced scalability and robustness under various distribution shifts.

Conclusion: ADAPT’s training-free, backpropagation-free approach provides a scalable and robust solution for test-time adaptation, broadening applicability under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

*Sumit Kumar Dam,Mrityunjoy Gain,Eui-Nam Huh,Choong Seon Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of spectral bias in Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) by introducing a two-stage training process that improves high-frequency detail reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the spectral bias issue in neural networks, which hampers the capture of high-frequency details such as sharp edges and fine textures within image reconstructions.

Method: A novel two-stage training strategy is proposed: 1) a neighbor-aware soft mask emphasizes regions with strong local variations to prioritize high-frequency details during early training, and 2) a transition to full-image training further enhances overall reconstruction.

Result: Experimental results show consistent improvements in image reconstruction quality when using the two-stage training strategy, complementing existing INR methodologies.

Conclusion: The approach introduces frequency-aware pixel importance to image INRs, presenting an innovative way to address spectral bias and encouraging further exploration in this direction.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

### [146] [Fast globally optimal Truncated Least Squares point cloud registration with fixed rotation axis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15613)
*Ivo Ivanov,Carsten Markgraf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces fast methods for robust point cloud registration with high outlier resistance, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud registration, crucial in fields like robotics and computer vision, struggles with high outlier rates and global optimization challenges.

Method: Proposes a linear-time convex relaxation and a contractor method to accelerate Branch and Bound (BnB).

Result: Achieves provable global optimality for 3D point cloud registration in under 0.5 seconds, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods like SDP solvers.

Conclusion: The methods provide a scalable, efficient solution for robust rotation-only TLS problem, though full 6DoF issues remain unsolved.

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

TL;DR: The study used camera traps and drone imagery to monitor spatial distributions of wildlife and human activities, allowing the identification of hotspots and conflicts in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To inform effective conservation planning by understanding spatial overlaps and potential conflicts between human and wildlife activities.

Method: Combined camera traps and drone thermal imagery, processed them with deep learning models, specifically YOLOv11s and Faster RCNN, for detecting wildlife and human activities. Conducted spatial pattern analysis to map activity hotspots.

Result: YOLOv11s achieved high detection metrics (precision 96.2%, recall 92.3%), while drone thermal imagery provided complementary aerial insights on activity zones. Identified conflict zones in CNP and buffer regions.

Conclusion: Integrating multiperspective monitoring and automated detection enhances understanding of human wildlife interactions, aiding conservation and management in protected landscapes.

Abstract: Wildlife and human activities are key components of landscape systems.
Understanding their spatial distribution is essential for evaluating human
wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with
automated object detection enhances wildlife surveillance and landscape
management.

### [148] [When and What: Diffusion-Grounded VideoLLM with Entity Aware Segmentation for Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15641)
*Pengcheng Fang,Yuxia Chen,Rui Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM with innovations to enhance temporal perception, entity alignment, and timestamp modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video understanding requires precise temporal and interaction comprehension, but existing Video LLMs struggle with fine-grained temporal reasoning and entity grounding.

Method: The authors propose a Diffusion Temporal Latent encoder, object-grounded representations, and a mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens for improved temporal consistency, alignment, and timestamp modeling.

Result: Grounded VideoDiT achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like Charades STA, NExT GQA, and various VideoQA datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed innovations significantly improve the temporal reasoning and grounding capabilities of Video LLMs, making Grounded VideoDiT highly effective for video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

*Swann Emilien Céleste Destouches,Jesse Lahaye,Laurent Valentin Jospin,Jan Skaloud*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a weakly supervised approach for tree instance segmentation using ALS data, which addresses challenges like data inconsistency and labeling costs by incorporating human quality ratings and feedback loops for model improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree instance segmentation is crucial for forest monitoring but is impeded by data variability (e.g., sensor resolution, terrain) and the high cost of obtaining well-labeled training data.

Method: Proposes a weakly supervised pipeline: initial labels from non-finetuned or closed-form methods are quality-rated by humans. These ratings train a model to classify segmentation quality, which in turn is used to improve the segmentation model.

Result: The approach improves segmentation accuracy by 34% in correctly identifying trees, while reducing non-tree predictions. However, limitations are noted in sparse forest areas and complex surroundings.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances segmentation performance and lowers dependence on extensive manual labeling but struggles in challenging environments like sparse forests or complex terrain.

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

### [150] [Towards a 3D Transfer-based Black-box Attack via Critical Feature Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15650)
*Shuchao Pang,Zhenghan Chen,Shen Zhang,Liming Lu,Siyuan Liang,Anan Du,Yongbin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CFG, a transfer-based black-box attack method to generate adversarial point clouds for 3D deep neural networks without requiring target model information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of 3D point cloud deep neural networks to adversarial examples, especially under situations where no information about target models is accessible due to security constraints.

Method: The proposed method, Critical Feature Guidance (CFG), identifies and prioritizes corrupting critical features that multiple architectures rely on for classification. It also constrains the adversarial point cloud's distortion to maintain visual imperceptibility.

Result: CFG achieves significantly higher transferability and performance compared to state-of-the-art 3D adversarial attack methods, as demonstrated on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmarks.

Conclusion: CFG improves the effectiveness and imperceptibility of transfer-based black-box attacks for 3D point clouds by exploiting consistent critical features and ensuring minimal deviations.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

### [151] [MapKD: Unlocking Prior Knowledge with Cross-Modal Distillation for Efficient Online HD Map Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15653)
*Ziyang Yan,Ruikai Li,Zhiyong Cui,Bohan Li,Han Jiang,Yilong Ren,Aoyong Li,Zhenning Li,Sijia Wen,Haiyang Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MapKD introduces a knowledge distillation framework for efficient, vision-only HD map construction in autonomous vehicles without relying on stale maps or multi-modal sensors. It boosts performance and inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current online HD map construction methods for autonomous vehicles rely heavily on stale offline maps or multi-modal sensor systems, leading to computational inefficiencies.

Method: The paper proposes MapKD, a Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS) framework for transferring knowledge from complex multimodal models to a streamlined vision-centric model. The techniques Token-Guided 2D Patch Distillation (TGPD) and Masked Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) are used to guide learning.

Result: MapKD enhances the student model's semantic learning by achieving +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP improvements on the nuScenes dataset while accelerating inference speed.

Conclusion: MapKD provides a more efficient solution for HD map construction with superior performance, leveraging knowledge distillation techniques to bridge gaps between complex multimodal systems and vision-centric models.

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CM2LoD3, a novel method for automatically reconstructing 3D building models at LoD3, incorporating facade elements such as windows and doors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detailed 3D building models (LoD3) are critical for urban analysis but are challenging to generate due to the manual modeling required.

Method: CM2LoD3 leverages Conflict Maps obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis and uses semantic segmentation techniques with synthetically generated maps and confidence-based textured model fusion.

Result: The proposed method achieved 61% performance in segmenting building openings using uncertainty-aware fusion techniques.

Conclusion: CM2LoD3 advances automated LoD3 reconstruction, making 3D city modeling more scalable and efficient.

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

*Yongju Jia,Jiarui Ma,Xiangxian Li,Baiqiao Zhang,Xianhui Cao,Juan Liu,Yulong Bian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MDPR, a fine-tuning framework for pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP, to address bias arising from class imbalances using dynamic prompt routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pre-trained vision-language models experience performance degradation due to bias from class imbalance during fine-tuning, which is inadequately addressed by current methods using LLMs.

Method: The proposed MDPR framework uses a knowledge base spanning five visual-semantic dimensions and employs dynamic routing to align visual classes, choose optimal prompts, and balance semantics during fine-tuning.

Result: MDPR achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods on long-tailed datasets like CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: MDPR is an efficient framework that effectively mitigates class imbalance issues during VLM fine-tuning, enhancing predictions while remaining computationally lightweight.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamMem introduces a memory-efficient query-agnostic KV cache mechanism for long and streaming video understanding, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the memory and computational challenges in handling long video contexts within multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially for scenarios requiring real-time processing and multi-turn conversations.

Method: StreamMem uses a query-agnostic approach to compress KV caches dynamically by leveraging attention scores between visual tokens and generic query tokens, maintaining a fixed-size memory for streaming video understanding.

Result: StreamMem demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in query-agnostic KV cache compression and performs competitively against query-aware methods on long video understanding and streaming video QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed StreamMem method effectively enables efficient and robust streaming video understanding by overcoming the limitations of existing visual compression methods, offering a practical solution to memory-constrained MLLM applications.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldWeaver introduces a framework to improve long video generation by jointly modeling RGB frames and perceptual conditions, addressing temporal and structural consistency challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative video models face challenges in maintaining accuracy for long sequences, particularly with structural and temporal drift due to reliance on RGB signals.

Method: WorldWeaver jointly predicts perceptual and RGB information from unified representations, integrates depth cues to enhance context via a memory bank, and employs segmented noise scheduling to reduce drift and computational costs.

Result: WorldWeaver significantly reduces temporal drift and enhances video fidelity, as demonstrated in experiments with diffusion- and flow-based models.

Conclusion: The paper establishes WorldWeaver as a robust solution for generating consistent and high-quality long videos by addressing key issues in temporal and structural consistency.

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

TL;DR: The paper presents the All-in-SAM model, improving vision foundation models in computational pathology for precise cell segmentation and classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models like SAM struggle with fine-grained semantic segmentation needed for computational pathology.

Method: Developed All-in-SAM model using molecular-empowered learning, SAM adaptation, and Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning.

Result: The model significantly enhances cell classification performance, even with varying annotation quality.

Conclusion: All-in-SAM reduces annotator workload, democratizes biomedical image analysis, and aids resource-limited diagnostics.

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap in high-quality video synthesis by integrating multiple generation tasks (T2V, I2V, T2I) into a single comprehensive framework, addressing alignment and training challenges.

Method: The proposed Hybrid Stream DiT architecture enhances alignment across modalities and accelerates training. A high-quality data curation pipeline, including manual annotations and an MLLM-based video quality model, ensures the quality of training samples.

Result: Waver achieves high-quality video generation with enhanced motion and temporal consistency. It consistently ranks among the Top 3 models on T2V and I2V leaderboards and matches state-of-the-art commercial solutions.

Conclusion: Waver demonstrates the capability to revolutionize video generation, setting benchmarks for open-source and commercial models. The training recipes aim to facilitate broader community advancements in video generation.

Abstract: We present Waver, a high-performance foundation model for unified image and
video generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging
from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently
upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V),
image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single,
integrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance
modality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data
quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually
annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the
highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and
inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building
on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving
superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency in video synthesis. Notably,
it ranks among the Top 3 on both the T2V and I2V leaderboards at Artificial
Analysis (data as of 2025-07-30 10:00 GMT+8), consistently outperforming
existing open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art

TL;DR: The paper introduces ATLAS, an advanced 3D body model that improves shape expressivity and pose capture by leveraging 600k high-resolution scans and decoupling skeleton from external shape representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D human body models struggle with capturing detailed variations in poses and shapes due to limited training data and problematic modeling chains.

Method: ATLAS learns from 600k high-resolution scans and decouples the shape and skeleton bases, enabling non-linear pose correctives and customization of body attributes.

Result: ATLAS achieves higher accuracy in fitting diverse poses and unseen subjects while better handling complex poses compared to linear models.

Conclusion: ATLAS significantly enhances 3D human body modeling with higher fidelity, enabling more precise and customizable applications in various domains.

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the

Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the

### [160] [Visual Autoregressive Modeling for Instruction-Guided Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15772)
*Qingyang Mao,Qi Cai,Yehao Li,Yingwei Pan,Mingyue Cheng,Ting Yao,Qi Liu,Tao Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VAREdit, a novel autoregressive framework for image editing that surpasses diffusion-based methods in adherence to instructions and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of diffusion models in image editing, specifically their inability to maintain precise adherence to editing instructions due to their global denoising process.

Method: The paper introduces VAREdit, a visual autoregressive framework conditioned on source image features and text instructions, using a Scale-Aligned Reference module to enhance scale-matched conditioning during feature prediction.

Result: VAREdit achieves over 30% better performance in GPT-Balance scores compared to leading diffusion-based methods and is 2.2 times faster in $512\times512$ image editing tasks.

Conclusion: VAREdit significantly improves editing precision and efficiency, positioning it as a superior alternative to diffusion-based methods for instruction-guided image editing.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

### [161] [Scaling Group Inference for Diverse and High-Quality Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15773)
*Gaurav Parmar,Or Patashnik,Daniil Ostashev,Kuan-Chieh Wang,Kfir Aberman,Srinivasa Narasimhan,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable group inference method to improve diversity and quality in sets of generated samples, addressing redundancies caused by independent sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Independent sampling in generative models leads to redundant outputs when users are presented with multiple images, which limits user choices and hampers idea exploration.

Method: The proposed method formulates group inference as a quadratic integer assignment problem using graph optimization, ensuring sample quality and diversity with runtime efficiency improved by progressive pruning of candidate sets.

Result: Experiments demonstrate significant enhancement in diversity and quality of sample groups compared to independent sampling baselines, and the framework works across diverse tasks like text-to-image, video generation, etc.

Conclusion: The method enables generative models to treat multiple outputs as cohesive groups, better aligning with real-world applications where users interact with a variety of samples.

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

### [162] [CineScale: Free Lunch in High-Resolution Cinematic Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15774)
*Haonan Qiu,Ning Yu,Ziqi Huang,Paul Debevec,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual diffusion models face challenges generating high-resolution content due to computational and training constraints. This paper introduces CineScale, an inference strategy addressing these limitations and supporting resolutions up to 8k for images and 4k for videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual diffusion models struggle with high-resolution generation because of limited training data, computational resources, and issues such as repetitive patterns arising from accumulated errors at higher frequencies.

Method: The authors propose CineScale, a novel inference method with tailored variants for different video generation architectures. CineScale expands beyond traditional high-resolution generation approaches by supporting multiple synthesis modes including I2V and V2V, leveraging open-source frameworks and minimal fine-tuning.

Result: CineScale successfully enables 8k image generation without fine-tuning and 4k video generation using minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate higher-quality output compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: CineScale effectively extends the capabilities of visual diffusion models, providing a versatile solution for higher-resolution image and video generation that minimizes fine-tuning requirements and delivers superior results.

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated
video samples are available at our website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of maintaining system performance, code manageability, and developer productivity, especially in large collaborative environments involving distributed data processing.

Method: The proposed architecture uses modular logical computation units called Pipes within Apache Spark, differing from traditional microservices by focusing on component boundaries and standardized interfaces.

Result: The approach achieved significant improvements: 50% better development efficiency, weeks-to-days collaboration, 500x scalability, 10x throughput in enterprise, and 5.7x faster throughput under academic tests with 99% CPU utilization.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture demonstrates how a modular design can optimize system performance and development speed in large-scale machine learning and data processing tasks.

Abstract: Modern distributed data processing systems face significant challenges in
balancing system performance with code maintainability and developer
productivity, particularly when integrating machine learning capabilities at

high communication overhead between teams and the complexity of coordinating
development across multiple groups. This paper presents a novel "Declarative

billions of records with high accuracy and efficiency. Our architecture
introduces a modular framework that seamlessly integrates machine learning
capabilities within Apache Spark by combining logical computation units that we
refer as Pipes, departing from traditional microservice-based approaches. By
establishing clear component boundaries and standardized interfaces, we achieve
both modularity and system optimization without sacrificing maintainability.
The enterprise case study demonstrate substantial improvements in multiple

collaboration/troubleshooting efforts compressed from weeks to days,
performance improved by 500x in scalability and by 10x in throughput. The
academic experiment also proves at least 5.7x faster in throughput with 99% CPU

### [164] [Databelt: A Continuous Data Path for Serverless Workflows in the 3D Compute Continuum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15351)
*Cynthia Marcelino,Leonard Guelmino,Thomas Pusztai,Stefan Nastic*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Databelt is a state management framework designed to address challenges in serverless workflows within dynamic environments like the 3D Compute Continuum, reducing latency, network overhead, and execution inefficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve challenges faced by serverless workflows in dynamic environments, such as frequent network topology changes and the latency caused by reliance on remote storage.

Method: Databelt introduces an SLO-aware state propagation mechanism and a function state fusion feature, ensuring proactive state offloading and efficient state retrieval within serverless runtime environments.

Result: Experimental results show Databelt reduces workflow execution time by up to 66%, increases throughput by 50%, and decreases latency in storage operations by 20%.

Conclusion: Databelt ensures efficient serverless workflow execution in dynamic environments by minimizing state access latency, network hops, and redundant operations, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Typically, serverless functions rely on remote storage services for managing
state, which can result in increased latency and network communication
overhead. In a dynamic environment such as the 3D (Edge-Cloud-Space) Compute
Continuum, serverless functions face additional challenges due to frequent
changes in network topology. As satellites move in and out of the range of
ground stations, functions must make multiple hops to access cloud services,
leading to high-latency state access and unnecessary data transfers. In this
paper, we present Databelt, a state management framework for serverless
workflows designed for the dynamic environment of the 3D Compute Continuum.
Databelt introduces an SLO-aware state propagation mechanism that enables the
function state to move continuously in orbit. Databelt proactively offloads
function states to the most suitable node, such that when functions execute,
the data is already present on the execution node or nearby, thus minimizing
state access latency and reducing the number of network hops. Additionally,
Databelt introduces a function state fusion mechanism that abstracts state
management for functions sharing the same serverless runtime. When functions
are fused, Databelt seamlessly retrieves their state as a group, reducing
redundant network and storage operations and improving overall workflow
efficiency. Our experimental results show that Databelt reduces workflow
execution time by up to 66% and increases throughput by 50% compared to the
baselines. Furthermore, our results show that Databelt function state fusion
reduces storage operations latency by up to 20%, by reducing repetitive storage
requests for functions within the same runtime, ensuring efficient execution of
serverless workflows in highly dynamic network environments such as the 3D
Continuum.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces mixed-precision inference techniques for optimizing memory and computational efficiency in Large Language Models using novel pipelines for GEMM and attention operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of LLMs demands innovations to reduce the memory and computational burdens associated with inference while maintaining high performance.

Method: The authors propose mixed-precision pipelines leveraging hardware-aware weight packing, adaptive head alignment, instruction-level parallelism, and a KV memory loading pipeline to optimize operations across various hardware and precision formats.

Result: Their approach demonstrates up to 61% lower serving latency, up to 156% higher throughput, and consistent improvements across multiple LLMs and GPU architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed solution significantly enhances the performance of mixed-precision inference for LLMs and is publicly available in TurboMind within the LMDeploy project.

Abstract: Mixed-precision inference techniques reduce the memory and computational
demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) by applying hybrid precision formats to
model weights, activations, and KV caches. This work introduces mixed-precision
LLM inference techniques that encompass (i) systematic memory and compute
optimization across hierarchical storage and tensor core architectures, and
(ii) comprehensive end-to-end mixed-precision optimization across diverse
precision formats and hardware configurations. Our approach features two novel
mixed-precision pipelines designed for optimal hardware utilization: a General
Matrix Multiply (GEMM) pipeline that optimizes matrix operations through
offline weight packing and online acceleration, and an attention pipeline that
enables efficient attention computation with arbitrary Query, Key, and Value
precision combinations. The key implementation of the pipelines includes (i)
hardware-aware weight packing for automatic format optimization, (ii) adaptive
head alignment for efficient attention computation, (iii) instruction-level
parallelism for memory hierarchy exploitation, and (iv) KV memory loading
pipeline for enhanced inference efficiency. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations across 16 popular LLMs and 4 representative GPU architectures.
Results demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 61% lower serving latency
(30% on average) and up to 156% higher throughput (58% on average) in
mixed-precision workloads compared to existing mixed-precision frameworks,
establishing consistent performance improvements across all tested
configurations and hardware types. This work is integrated into TurboMind, a

*Caterina Feletti,Paola Flocchini,Debasish Pattanayak,Giuseppe Prencipe,Nicola Santoro*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper addresses the Dancing problem, where a swarm of autonomous robots perform a sequence of patterns, introducing a solution under the LUMI model with light-enabled robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if crucial constraints on robot choreographies and initial configurations can be relaxed by adopting the LUMI model and sequential scheduling.

Method: A distributed counter mechanism is implemented with light-enabled robots (LUMI model) under a sequential scheduler to solve Universal Dancing problems.

Result: It is proven that necessary constraints can be dropped, but the length of feasible choreographies is bounded by the compositions of robot count into the number of available colors.

Conclusion: The study broadens solvability of the Dancing problem, providing an algorithm that achieves spatially homogeneous choreographies, even with non-rigid movements.

Abstract: The Dancing problem requires a swarm of $n$ autonomous mobile robots to form
a sequence of patterns, aka perform a choreography. Existing work has proven
that some crucial restrictions on choreographies and initial configurations
(e.g., on repetitions of patterns, periodicity, symmetries,
contractions/expansions) must hold so that the Dancing problem can be solved
under certain robot models. Here, we prove that these necessary constraints can
be dropped by considering the LUMI model (i.e., where robots are endowed with a
light whose color can be chosen from a constant-size palette) under the quite
unexplored sequential scheduler. We formalize the class of Universal Dancing
problems which require a swarm of $n$ robots starting from any initial
configuration to perform a (periodic or finite) sequence of arbitrary patterns,
only provided that each pattern consists of $n$ vertices (including
multiplicities). However, we prove that, to be solvable under LUMI, the length
of the feasible choreographies is bounded by the compositions of $n$ into the
number of colors available to the robots. We provide an algorithm solving the
Universal Dancing problem by exploiting the peculiar capability of sequential
robots to implement a distributed counter mechanism. Even assuming non-rigid
movements, our algorithm ensures spatial homogeneity of the performed
choreography.

### [167] [Lower Bounds for $k$-Set Agreement in Fault-Prone Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15562)
*Pierre Fraigniaud,Minh Hang Nguyen,Ami Paz,Ulrich Schmid,Hugo Rincon Galeana*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This study proposes a new lower bound for k-set agreement in synchronous message-passing systems with arbitrary directed communication networks, addressing limitations in previous works and utilizing a topological proof approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to extend existing bounds on k-set agreement problems in distributed systems to arbitrary directed networks and scenarios involving initial crashes, overcoming limitations of prior models.

Method: The authors use a topological proof approach based on shellable carrier maps, Sperner's lemma-style arguments, and novel carrier maps to maintain high connectivity.

Result: The study derives a generalized lower bound for k-set agreement in synchronous systems, accounts for initial crashes, and introduces a smaller shellable input complex for k-set agreement.

Conclusion: The findings improve our understanding of k-set agreement in synchronous message-passing networks and demonstrate the feasibility of using smaller, more efficient constructs for solving these problems.

Abstract: We develop a new lower bound for k-set agreement in synchronous
message-passing systems connected by an arbitrary directed communication
network, where up to t processes may crash. Our result thus generalizes the
t/k+1 lower bound for complete networks in the t-resilient model by Chaudhuri,
Herlihy, Lynch, and Tuttle [JACM'00]. Moreover, it generalizes two lower bounds
for oblivious algorithms in synchronous systems connected by an arbitrary
undirected communication network known to the processes, namely, the domination
number-based lower bound by Castaneda, Fraigniaud, Paz, Rajsbaum, Roy, and
Travers [TCS'21] for failure-free processes, and the radius-based lower bound
in the t-resilient model by Fraigniaud, Nguyen, and Paz [STACS'24].
  Our topological proof non-trivially generalizes and extends the
connectivity-based approach for the complete network, as presented in the book
by Herlihy, Kozlov, and Rajsbaum (2013). It is based on a sequence of shellable
carrier maps that, starting from a shellable input complex, determine the
evolution of the protocol complex: During the first t/k rounds, carrier maps
that crash exactly k processes per round are used, ensuring high connectivity
of their images. A Sperner's lemma style argument is used to prove that k-set
agreement is still impossible by that round. From round t/k+1 up to our lower
bound, we employ a novel carrier map that maintains high connectivity. Our
proof also provides a strikingly simple lower bound for k-set agreement in
synchronous systems with an arbitrary communication network with initial
crashes. We express the resulting additional agreement overhead via an
appropriately defined radius of the communication graphs. Finally, we prove
that the usual input pseudosphere complex for k-set agreement can be replaced
by an exponentially smaller input complex based on Kuhn triangulations, which
we prove to be also shellable.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces CausalMesh, a causally consistent caching system designed for serverless workflows with mobile computations, featuring lower latency and higher throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Serverless workflows often use caches for better I/O latency, but traditional approaches face challenges with consistency when functions migrate between nodes.

Method: CausalMesh offers a protocol for causally consistent caching with coordination-free and abort-free operations, verified through formal methods in Dafny.

Result: Experiments reveal that CausalMesh outperforms existing caching systems in terms of latency and throughput.

Conclusion: CausalMesh provides a robust, efficient caching solution for serverless environments, addressing critical consistency issues during client mobility.

Abstract: Stateful serverless workflows consist of multiple serverless functions that
access state on a remote database. Developers sometimes add a cache layer
between the serverless runtime and the database to improve I/O latency.
However, in a serverless environment, functions in the same workflow may be
scheduled to different nodes with different caches, which can cause
non-intuitive anomalies. This paper presents CausalMesh, a novel approach to
causally consistent caching in environments where a computation may migrate
from one machine to another, such as in serverless computing. CausalMesh is the
first cache system that supports coordination-free and abort-free read/write
operations and read transactions when clients roam among multiple servers.
CausalMesh also supports read-write transactional causal consistency in the
presence of client roaming, but at the cost of abort-freedom.
  We have formally verified CausalMesh's protocol in Dafny, and our
experimental evaluation shows that CausalMesh has lower latency and higher
throughput than existing proposals

Motivation: The need to ensure both safety and ethical reasoning in autonomous vehicles for widespread adoption.

Method: Hierarchical Safe RL framework combining ethical risk costs, dynamic experience replay, polynomial path planning, and PID controllers.

Result: Demonstrated improved reduction in ethical risks and enhanced driving performance using real-world traffic data.

Conclusion: Ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles can be enhanced using Safe RL, combining formal control theories with data-driven learning.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and
improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on
embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers. Here,
we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that
explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At
the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk
cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level
motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies
learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,
polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible
trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our
approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,
cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods
in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge,
this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via
Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of
combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically
accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a personalized lung cancer risk prediction system using similarity search and a large language model (LLM) to select the most appropriate prediction algorithm tailored to a patient's profile.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lung cancer risk prediction remains difficult due to variability in patient populations and clinical settings, making it essential to develop a system that dynamically adjusts to diverse cohorts.

Method: The system combines FAISS-based cohort retrieval with reasoning by a Large Language Model (LLM) to select the best-performing prediction model for a patient, based on CT scans and metadata.

Result: The proposed two-stage pipeline effectively personalizes risk prediction by leveraging diverse cohorts and multiple predictive models, providing a flexible path for individualized assessments.

Conclusion: This method achieves tailored lung cancer risk prediction, paving the way for improved clinical decision-making in heterogeneous and real-world settings.

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer risk prediction remains challenging due to substantial
variability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single model
performs best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lung
cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate
model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern
retrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured
metadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the
agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search
across nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient
population from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model
(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance
metrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight
representative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,
Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer
vision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent
pipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,
cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building
on this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model
selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward
individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity of symptom evolution and insufficient modeling of temporal dependencies in current Parkinson's disease progression prediction.

Method: The framework uses graph neural networks for structural relationships and a Transformer for dynamic temporal modeling, combined through a structure-aware gating mechanism.

Result: The method outperforms existing models in metrics such as AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1, with improved classification of progression stages and personalized symptom trajectories.

Conclusion: The proposed framework shows strong generalization and scalability, offering reliable support for chronic disease modeling like Parkinson's.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of symptom evolution complexity and
insufficient temporal dependency modeling in Parkinson's disease progression
prediction. It proposes a unified prediction framework that integrates
structural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural
networks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical
symptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic
dependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture
to model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse
structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is
designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings
and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key
progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the
framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph
construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer.
The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The
experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of
hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1
metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the
model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall
framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability,
providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive

Result: The proposed approach achieved an 8% improvement in test accuracy over baselines on the Spider dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Restricting and structuring the search space with hierarchical templates and adaptive mutations drastically improves the performance and reliability of NAS for text classification tasks.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest
due to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed
ones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other
language-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have
a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the
architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and
mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search
space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an
unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we
propose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive
Mutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse
architectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to
search on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on
the basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that
dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using
Q-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search
space. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective
exploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id
(db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing
architectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method
achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), addressing overfitting and collapse issues in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by incorporating gradient decoupling, stability improvements, and controllable rejection suppression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the widely used Direct Preference Optimization, which suffers from overfitting and collapse, by creating a more robust and stable preference alignment framework.

Method: The authors propose LPO with gradient decoupling through an absolute difference loss, stability via an offset constraint and positive regularization term, and controllable rejection suppression using gradient separation and a tunable coefficient.

Result: LPO achieves consistent performance improvements across various tasks such as general text, math, and text-to-speech, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: LPO is presented as a robust and tunable framework for preference alignment, addressing key issues in existing methods, and the authors provide public access to related resources.

Abstract: DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) has become a widely used offline
preference optimization algorithm due to its simplicity and training stability.
However, DPO is prone to overfitting and collapse. To address these challenges,
we propose Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel alignment framework
featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce gradient decoupling by
replacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, thereby
isolating the optimization dynamics. Second, we improve stability through an
offset constraint combined with a positive regularization term to preserve the
chosen response quality. Third, we implement controllable rejection suppression
using gradient separation with straightforward estimation and a tunable
coefficient that linearly regulates the descent of the rejection probability.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LPO consistently improves
performance on various tasks, including general text tasks, math tasks, and
text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. These results establish LPO as a robust and tunable
paradigm for preference alignment, and we release the source code, models, and
training data publicly.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LFM4Ads introduces a novel framework that enhances online ad recommendations by leveraging comprehensive representation transfers and multi-granularity mechanisms, yielding significant business outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in online advertising neglect item representations and user-item cross representations, which limits the effectiveness of recommendation systems.

Method: The framework transfers user, item, and cross representations from pre-trained foundation models and incorporates multi-granularity mechanisms for feature, module, and model-level adaptation.

Result: LFM4Ads successfully processes billions of daily samples, leading to production launches with an overall platform GMV lift of 2.45%, translating to significant annual revenue growth.

Conclusion: LFM4Ads demonstrates substantial enhancement in online advertising performance by optimizing representation transfers and granularity mechanisms, setting a new benchmark in the domain.

Abstract: Online advertising relies on accurate recommendation models, with recent
advances using pre-trained large-scale foundation models (LFMs) to capture
users' general interests across multiple scenarios and tasks. However, existing
methods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user
representations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and
user-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in
downstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and
overlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an
All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.
It first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available
representations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the
CRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into
transferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability
via multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level
transfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and
Standalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully
deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of
billions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters
with billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand
features. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+
successful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including
primary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an
overall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated
annual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

*Sami Alabed,Dominik Grewe,Norman Alexander Rink,Timur Sitdikov,Agnieszka Swietlik,Dimitrios Vytiniotis,Daniel Belov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a system combining static compiler analysis and Monte Carlo Tree Search to optimize the partitioning of large machine learning models across distributed systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address inefficiencies and constraints in the auto-partitioning of large machine learning models, which often lead to out-of-memory errors or slow processing.

Method: The system uses static compiler analysis to create an efficient decision space and identifies sharding requirements and conflicts, combined with Monte Carlo Tree Search for optimization.

Result: The proposed system surpasses state-of-the-art industrial approaches in terms of performance, scalability, and automation for diverse hardware and complex models.

Conclusion: The authors demonstrate that their system discovers improved partitioning solutions more efficiently, fully automating the process while solving memory and performance challenges.

Abstract: Partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator
systems is a complex process, requiring a series of interdependent decisions
that are further complicated by internal sharding ambiguities. Consequently,
existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are
prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible
partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space,
but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device
memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance.
  We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a
Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by
identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii)
partitioning "conflicts" that require resolution.
  Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods
across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering
previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even
for complex and large models.

### [178] [Twin-Boot: Uncertainty-Aware Optimization via Online Two-Sample Bootstrapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15019)
*Carlos Stein Brito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), an approach to incorporate uncertainty estimation directly into gradient descent for better calibration and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gradient descent methods lack uncertainty estimation, which becomes critical in overparameterized and low-data scenarios due to the potential for overfitting. Classical bootstrapping, while effective for uncertainty estimation, is impractical for deep learning.

Method: The proposed Twin-Boot trains two identical models in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, periodically re-aligns their trajectories to the same optimization basin, and uses their divergence to estimate uncertainty. This uncertainty is then utilized in adapting the sampling of training weights.

Result: The method improved both calibration and generalization performance in deep learning tasks, particularly in high-dimensional and complex inverse problem scenarios. It also produced interpretable uncertainty maps.

Conclusion: The Twin-Boot framework is an effective way to integrate uncertainty estimation into deep learning optimization, overcoming limitations of traditional gradient descent and bootstrapping approaches by leveraging a resampling-based training strategy.

Abstract: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of
confidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes,
where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily
overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty
estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is
impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates
that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across
runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce
Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training
procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two
identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and
a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their
divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use
this estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing
regularization that favors flatter solutions. In deep neural networks and
complex high-dimensional inverse problems, the approach improves calibration
and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

*Anurup Naskar,Nathanael Zhixin Wong,Sara Shamekh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CuMoLoS-MAE is a deep learning-based model that enhances atmospheric field reconstruction by restoring fine-scale features and providing pixel-wise uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for atmospheric profile reconstruction blur fine-scale structures, and deep models lack confidence estimates, necessitating a more precise approach.

Method: CuMoLoS-MAE utilizes a curriculum-guided masked autoencoder with Monte Carlo stochastic ensemble inference to reconstruct fine-scale features while quantifying pixel-wise uncertainty.

Result: The proposed method achieves high-fidelity atmospheric reconstruction along with a finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map.

Conclusion: CuMoLoS-MAE aids in convection diagnostics, real-time data assimilation, and improved climate reanalysis through its accurate reconstructions and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler
Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to
Noise Ratio) gates, range folding, and spurious discontinuities. Traditional
gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence
estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic
Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as
updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a
data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise
uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that
forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At
inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random
mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the
outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a
finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity
reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced
convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves
long-term climate reanalysis.

### [180] [Mini-Batch Robustness Verification of Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15454)
*Saar Tzour-Shaday,Dana Drachsler Cohen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BaVerLy, a method for improving the efficiency of verifying local robustness in neural network image classifiers by using group verification and mini-batching techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current local robustness verification methods for neural networks either take too long to analyze or lose precision, limiting their effectiveness on large datasets.

Method: BaVerLy dynamically groups similar $
$-balls into mini-batches for joint verification, leveraging shared computational similarities. If verification fails for a mini-batch, refinement strategies are applied to expedite analysis.

Result: BaVerLy improves verification efficiency, achieving an average speedup of 2.3x and a maximum speedup of 4.1x. Verification tasks requiring 24 hours with traditional methods were reduced to 6 hours.

Conclusion: Group-based strategies like BaVerLy allow for significant improvements in the processing time for local robustness verification without sacrificing accuracy, demonstrating scalability for evaluating neural network robustness.

Abstract: Neural network image classifiers are ubiquitous in many safety-critical
applications. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To
understand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have
been proposed to analyze $\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers
introduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less
effective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to
local robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to
leverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\epsilon$-balls
to reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete
verifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of
$\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches.
BaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly
constructs mini-batches of $\epsilon$-balls that have similar network
computations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all
$\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\epsilon$-ball is suspected
as not being robust, guiding the refinement. In the latter case, BaVerLy
leverages the analysis results to expedite the analysis of that $\epsilon$-ball
as well as the other $\epsilon$-balls in the batch. We evaluate BaVerLy on
fully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. Results show
that BaVerLy scales the common one by one verification by 2.3x on average and
up to 4.1x, in which case it reduces the total analysis time from 24 hours to 6
hours.

### [181] [Robust Estimation Under Heterogeneous Corruption Rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15051)
*Syomantak Chaudhuri,Jerry Li,Thomas A. Courtade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates robust estimation in the presence of non-uniform corruption rates across samples, deriving minimax rates for mean estimation and linear regression problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In distributed and federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, data samples may have heterogeneous corruption rates. Existing estimators fail to account for this heterogeneity, motivating the study.

Method: The paper examines multivariate and univariate distributions to derive minimax rates, introducing methods that analyze errors considering varying corruption patterns. For certain setups, they provide strategies to discard overly corrupted samples.

Result: They successfully derive tight minimax rates for heterogeneous corruption patterns in mean estimation tasks for bounded and Gaussian distributions, and for squared error in linear regression up to a factor of √d.

Conclusion: The research emphasizes that optimal estimators can improve robustness by dismissing highly corrupted samples, with thresholds determined by observed corruption rates.

Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption
rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but
non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and
federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust
estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring
structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded
distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax
rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean
estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared
error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our
findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be
discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the
empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

TL;DR: Aura-CAPTCHA is an advanced CAPTCHA system integrating AI models like GANs, RL, and LLMs to improve security against bots, featuring dynamic image and audio challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the growing vulnerabilities in traditional CAPTCHA systems due to advancements in AI technologies like OCR and adversarial image processing.

Method: Aura-CAPTCHA utilizes GANs for dynamic image generation, RL for adaptive difficulty tuning, and LLMs for crafting text and audio prompts. It introduces multi-modal challenges, including visual grids and combined audio tasks, with RL adjusting complexity based on user behaviors.

Result: Evaluations showed a 92% human success rate and only a 10% bot bypass rate, making Aura-CAPTCHA significantly more effective than existing solutions.

Conclusion: Aura-CAPTCHA offers a robust, scalable, and user-friendly mechanism to secure online platforms, outperforming traditional methods in both security and accessibility.

Abstract: Aura-CAPTCHA was developed as a multi-modal CAPTCHA system to address
vulnerabilities in traditional methods that are increasingly bypassed by AI
technologies, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and adversarial image
processing. The design integrated Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for
generating dynamic image challenges, Reinforcement Learning (RL) for adaptive
difficulty tuning, and Large Language Models (LLMs) for creating text and audio
prompts. Visual challenges included 3x3 grid selections with at least three
correct images, while audio challenges combined randomized numbers and words
into a single task. RL adjusted difficulty based on incorrect attempts,
response time, and suspicious user behavior. Evaluations on real-world traffic
demonstrated a 92% human success rate and a 10% bot bypass rate, significantly
outperforming existing CAPTCHA systems. The system provided a robust and
scalable approach for securing online applications while remaining accessible
to users, addressing gaps highlighted in previous research.

*Anastasis Kratsios,Ariel Neufeld,Philipp Schmocker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the gap between theoretical limitations and practical performance of Neural Operators (NOs) by introducing generative equilibrium operators (GEOs) for solving convex optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reconcile the theoretical discrepancy surrounding Neural Operators, whose universal approximation bounds suggest infeasibility, with their empirical success.

Method: The study models GEOs using finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers to solve families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space.

Result: The results demonstrate that GEOs can approximate solutions to arbitrary precision with parameters scaling logarithmically to the approximation error. Validation is provided via applications to nonlinear PDEs, stochastic optimal control, and mathematical finance.

Conclusion: GEOs bridge the gap between theory and practice, providing scalable and effective solutions to infinite-dimensional problems, verified both theoretically and experimentally.

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) are a class of deep learning models designed to
simultaneously solve infinitely many related problems by casting them into an
infinite-dimensional space, whereon these NOs operate. A significant gap
remains between theory and practice: worst-case parameter bounds from universal
approximation theorems suggest that NOs may require an unrealistically large
number of parameters to solve most operator learning problems, which stands in
direct opposition to a slew of experimental evidence. This paper closes that
gap for a specific class of {NOs}, generative {equilibrium operators} (GEOs),
using (realistic) finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers, when solving
families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space $X$.
Here, the inputs are smooth, convex loss functions on $X$, and outputs are the
associated (approximate) solutions to the optimization problem defined by each
input loss.
  We show that when the input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional
compact sets, our GEO can uniformly approximate the corresponding solutions to
arbitrary precision, with rank, depth, and width growing only logarithmically
in the reciprocal of the approximation error. We then validate both our
theoretical results and the trainability of GEOs on three applications: (1)
nonlinear PDEs, (2) stochastic optimal control problems, and (3) hedging
problems in mathematical finance under liquidity constraints.

*Rustem Islamov,Niccolo Ajroldi,Antonio Orvieto,Aurelien Lucchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NGN-M, a momentum-based optimizer, improving hyperparameter stability and matching state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter tuning, especially step-size, is challenging and resource-intensive in modern optimization algorithms.

Method: The authors adapt the NGN step-size method into a momentum-based version, achieving standard convergence rates under relaxed assumptions.

Result: NGN-M achieves comparable or superior performance to other optimizers while being robust to step-size hyperparameter variations.

Conclusion: Through theoretical and empirical analysis, NGN-M showcases enhanced stability and performance without stringent conditions or extensive tuning.

Abstract: Modern optimization algorithms that incorporate momentum and adaptive
step-size offer improved performance in numerous challenging deep learning
tasks. However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often
difficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts
have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide
range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we
introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art
optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size
hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto
and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that
attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less
restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or
assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to
previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the
combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness
to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that
is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hydra proposes an architecture for long-context language models with a combination of SSM, sparse attention, MoE routing, and dual memory within 1.6B parameters, providing a blueprint for modular and adaptive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of designing efficient, modular, and input-adaptive long-context language models.

Method: The Hydra architecture combines Mamba-style SSM backbone, sparse attention, MoE feed-forward routing, and dual memory systems while formalizing interfaces and scaling behaviors.

Result: Toy-scale prototype tests demonstrate feasibility, controllable expert routing, and qualitative scaling behaviors, but competitive full-scale performance still needs validation.

Conclusion: Hydra serves as a conceptual framework rather than a finalized system, encouraging empirical validation and follow-up studies in adaptive long-context models.

Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context
language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory
mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B
parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State
Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention,
chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM)
memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and
complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably
activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale
prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose
sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative
scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and
controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance.
We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory
utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to
stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM
efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory,
Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language
models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEAL is a novel graph neural network designed to provide interpretable predictions for molecular graphs by attributing outputs to meaningful substructures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of interpretability in graph neural networks used for predicting molecular properties, which limits trust in applications like drug discovery and materials design.

Method: SEAL decomposes molecular graphs into chemically meaningful fragments, estimates their causal influence on predictions, and reduces inter-fragment message passing via a specialized architecture.

Result: SEAL outperforms existing explainability methods in quantitative attribution metrics, human-aligned interpretability, and user trustworthiness in synthetic and real-world applications.

Conclusion: SEAL bridges the gap between high predictive performance and interpretability, offering more transparent molecular modeling for critical applications.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting
molecular properties by leveraging the rich structural information encoded in
molecular graphs. However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability,
which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug
discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques
often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or
substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL
(Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph
neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular
subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and
estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between
fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing
inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both
quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user
study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy
explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive
performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more
transparent and actionable molecular modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of improving federated learning's convergence for nonlinear systems compared to centralized methods, especially by leveraging better feature map selection.

Method: Theoretical analysis of convergence rates based on feature maps in nonlinear systems, combined with experimental validation using realistic physical system data.

Result: Federated learning outperforms centralized approaches in convergence for individual clients, with better results as the number of clients increases.

Conclusion: Federated approaches are effective for nonlinear system identification, particularly under careful feature map selection, achieving better convergence rates as the client base grows.

Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems.
We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear
system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that
the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the
convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant,
this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen
in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We
experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices
are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d.
random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use
trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic
feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components,
representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics.
We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise
levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning
consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of
participating clients increases.

Result: The proposed solutions lead to significant reductions in training costs while maintaining model accuracy, with only minor time overhead.

Conclusion: This paper provides a comprehensive solution to challenges in layer-freezing, demonstrating its feasibility and offering insights into optimizing freezing and compression strategies for efficient DNN training.

Abstract: With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational
costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique
has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively
reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing
methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate
feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.
To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches
feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to
train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be
straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely
overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations
to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these
overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method
will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first
to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.
To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel
augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a
minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate
lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive
compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are
frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves
significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with
a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their
application for efficient DNN training.

*Elif Konyar,Mostafa Reisi Gahrooei,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method using multi-task learning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition to model subpopulation variations efficiently, yielding better predictions and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling heterogeneous subpopulations with diverse behaviors and characteristics effectively.

Method: The authors utilize multi-task learning (MTL) combined with low-rank tensor decomposition to create personalized models by capturing shared structures and subpopulation-specific variations.

Result: The proposed method outperforms several benchmarks, particularly in scenarios with significant variability among subpopulations, showing improved prediction accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: The framework facilitates efficient learning of personalized models by balancing shared knowledge across tasks with preserving subpopulation-specific traits, enhancing both accuracy and understanding.

Abstract: Effective modeling of heterogeneous subpopulations presents a significant
challenge due to variations in individual characteristics and behaviors. This
paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue through multi-task
learning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition techniques. Our MTL approach
aims to enhance personalized modeling by leveraging shared structures among
similar tasks while accounting for distinct subpopulation-specific variations.
We introduce a framework where low-rank decomposition decomposes the collection
of task model parameters into a low-rank structure that captures commonalities
and variations across tasks and subpopulations. This approach allows for
efficient learning of personalized models by sharing knowledge between similar
tasks while preserving the unique characteristics of each subpopulation.
Experimental results in simulation and case study datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method compared to several benchmarks,
particularly in scenarios with high variability among subpopulations. The
proposed framework not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances
interpretability by revealing underlying patterns that contribute to the
personalization of models.

### [190] [Investigation of D-Wave quantum annealing for training Restricted Boltzmann Machines and mitigating catastrophic forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15697)
*Abdelmoula El-Yazizi,Yaroslav Koshka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares D-Wave quantum annealer's sampling and classical Monte Carlo methods applied to RBMs; no significant RBM training improvements were noted, but alternative applications like mitigating catastrophic forgetting show promise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if and why D-Wave quantum annealer's sampling does not significantly enhance RBM training and explore alternative uses for the QA-generated sampling.

Method: A hybrid sampling approach combining quantum annealing (QA) and classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques was analyzed. Generative replay was evaluated for catastrophic forgetting mitigation.

Result: No enhancement in RBM training was found. QA-based sampling showed the potential to help mitigate catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning with competitive efficiency.

Conclusion: While QA-based methods failed to improve RBM training, their sampling variety holds promise for tasks like catastrophic forgetting mitigation in machine learning applications.

Abstract: Modest statistical differences between the sampling performances of the
D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), are explored to explain,
and possibly address, the absence of significant and consistent improvements in
RBM trainability when the D-Wave sampling was used in previous investigations.
A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA
contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest
differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM
training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences
between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low
probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the
quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties
in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of
the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task.
On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from
lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other
machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic
forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using
QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative
replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of
the CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical
mitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable
patterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising
for a variety of challenging machine learning applications.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how deep neural networks (DNNs) generalize and handle fooling examples, introducing a new "wormhole" solution to address overparameterization issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why DNNs confidently classify random or unstructured inputs and explore generalization behavior in unsupervised settings.

Method: An analytical framework based on maximum likelihood estimation that avoids gradient-based optimization and explicit labels.

Result: Reveals DNNs' feature space collapse in overparameterized regimes, leading to degeneracy. Introduces a "wormhole" solution to handle fooling examples and improve generalization.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into DNN generalization, introduces the wormhole solution to enhance learning, and suggests directions for future unsupervised learning research.

Abstract: This work investigates the generalization behavior of deep neural networks
(DNNs), focusing on the phenomenon of "fooling examples," where DNNs
confidently classify inputs that appear random or unstructured to humans. To
explore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum
likelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches
that rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis
reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse
in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network
generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy,
where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same
output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this
degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived "wormhole" solution. The
wormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles
meaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut
learning. These findings offer deeper insights into DNN generalization and
highlight directions for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised
settings to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

### [192] [Evaluating Sparse Autoencoders for Monosemantic Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15094)
*Moghis Fereidouni,Muhammad Umair Haider,Peizhong Ju,A. B. Siddique*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes sparse autoencoders (SAEs) as a method to reduce polysemanticity in large language model neurons and improve interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polysemanticity in neurons of large language models presents challenges for interpretability, motivating the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to achieve more monosemantic neuron activations.

Method: The authors evaluate SAEs against base language models using a novel concept separability score based on Jensen-Shannon distance, across multiple benchmarks with interventions like full neuron masking and partial suppression.

Result: SAEs reduce polysemanticity and increase concept separability. However, sparsity does not consistently improve separability and can hurt downstream performance. APP, a new intervention method introduced in this paper, outperforms existing methods in targeted concept removal.

Conclusion: SAEs improve monosemanticity and enable better concept-level control compared to base models, but excessive sparsity can be detrimental. The proposed APP method offers an effective approach for precise concept removal in model neurons.

Abstract: A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where
neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations
into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs
promote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their
base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs
against base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained
concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures
how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using
Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs
reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,
greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often
impairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate
concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and
partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more
precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,
we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention
method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted
suppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

*Shaswati Saha,Sourajit Saha,Manas Gaur,Tejas Gokhale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Concept Erasure Techniques (CETs) aimed at preventing the generation of certain target concepts in text-to-image models are found to be easily circumvented and carry unintended side effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address rising concerns about privacy, copyright, and safety in generative models through robust concept erasure mechanisms.

Method: Developed Side Effect Evaluation (SEE), a benchmark to measure side effects of CETs using hierarchical and compositional prompts, alongside an automated evaluation pipeline.

Result: Experiments show CETs are vulnerable to circumvention via hierarchical and semantic prompts, suffer from attribute leakage, and exhibit unintended attention-related phenomena.

Conclusion: Current CETs require significant improvement as they are prone to evasion and unanticipated side effects, and the provided dataset and tools aim to foster further research in this area.

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy,
copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques
(CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired
``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to
synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present
several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side
Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical
and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of
CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets,
and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

*Sk Miraj Ahmed,Umit Yigit Basaran,Dripta S. Raychaudhuri,Arindam Dutta,Rohit Kundu,Fahim Faisal Niloy,Basak Guler,Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for efficient data unlearning in machine learning models without requiring access to the original training dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing data privacy concerns and regulations, it is crucial to remove specific data from trained models, especially when the original training data is inaccessible.

Method: The authors introduce a source-free unlearning method that estimates the Hessian of unknown remaining training data to enable zero-shot unlearning with theoretical guarantees.

Result: The approach demonstrates high efficiency and retains performance on the remaining data across various datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses source-free unlearning challenges, ensuring compliance with privacy requirements while maintaining model integrity.

Abstract: As machine learning becomes more pervasive and data privacy regulations
evolve, the ability to remove private or copyrighted information from trained
models is becoming an increasingly critical requirement. Existing unlearning
methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training
dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold
true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be
accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus
on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be
capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access
to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method
that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial
component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation
technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing
robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining
performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of
datasets verify the efficacy of our method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends reinforcement learning concepts using advanced mathematical frameworks like universal coalgebras and topos theory, generalizing RL to Universal Reinforcement Learning (URL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a categorial generalization of reinforcement learning by leveraging mathematical abstractions, enhancing our understanding of RL frameworks and broadening their capability.

Method: The approach involves using categorial concepts like functors and categories to model RL, introducing asynchronous distributed minimization models and extending dynamical system models through universal coalgebras.

Result: It shows that dynamical systems like MDPs and PSRs can be generalized into universal coalgebras and provides methods to find fixed points for determining value functions in an asynchronous parallel-distributed manner.

Conclusion: Universal coalgebras and categorial abstractions enable a broader and more generalized framework for analyzing RL problems, offering insights into computation and distributed systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a categorial generalization of RL, termed
universal reinforcement learning (URL), building on powerful mathematical
abstractions from the study of coinduction on non-well-founded sets and
universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous
parallel distributed computation. In the first half of the paper, we review the
basic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,
showing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce
a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas
and Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and
their proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms
for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain
category forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject
classifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we
move on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov
decision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state
representation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special
types of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras,
extending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL. The core problem
in finding fixed points in RL to determine the exact or approximate (action)
value function is generalized in URL to determining the final coalgebra
asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.

Motivation: Address the lack of consensus and reproducibility challenges in recent DPML research claiming state-of-the-art results.

Method: Conduct reproducibility and replicability experiments on 11 SoTA DPML techniques, analyzing outcomes and challenges.

Result: Some methods were reproducible, while others failed under different experimental conditions, highlighting variability due to DP noise.

Conclusion: Reproducibility varies among DPML techniques, requiring refined best practices to attain scientifically reliable validations.

Abstract: There is a flurry of recent research papers proposing novel differentially
private machine learning (DPML) techniques. These papers claim to achieve new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and offer empirical results as validation.
However, there is no consensus on which techniques are most effective or if
they genuinely meet their stated claims. Complicating matters, heterogeneity in
codebases, datasets, methodologies, and model architectures make direct
comparisons of different approaches challenging.
  In this paper, we conduct a reproducibility and replicability (R+R)
experiment on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from the recent research
literature. Results of our investigation are varied: while some methods stand
up to scrutiny, others falter when tested outside their initial experimental
conditions. We also discuss challenges unique to the reproducibility of DPML,
including additional randomness due to DP noise, and how to address them.
Finally, we derive insights and best practices to obtain scientifically valid
and reliable results.

*Xiangman Li,Xiaodong Wu,Qi Li,Jianbing Ni,Rongxing Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SafeLLM is a new defense framework designed to address jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) by unlearning harmful knowledge and maintaining general model fluency through a three-stage process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jailbreak attacks can cause LLMs to generate harmful or biased content, posing significant safety concerns. There is a need for effective strategies to mitigate these risks while preserving the models' overall functionality.

Method: SafeLLM uses a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic detection of unsafe content through hybrid methods, (2) harmful content tracing via feedforward network activations, and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without degrading model quality.

Result: The experiments on LLMs like Vicuna, LLaMA, and GPT-J show that SafeLLM significantly reduces attack success rates, maintains high performance, and is more robust and safer compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SafeLLM demonstrates that unlearning harmful knowledge provides a scalable, effective, and precise approach to improving LLM safety without sacrificing general capabilities.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms,
causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this
paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that
unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and
general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic
unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external
classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content
tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful
knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without
degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible
forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for
harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,
LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM
substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high
general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as
supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers
stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and
greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general
performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight
unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.

TL;DR: This paper introduces FairPrep, a benchmarking framework for evaluating fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardized evaluation tools for fairness-aware pre-processing methods, which play a critical role in mitigating biases at the data level.

Method: Developing FairPrep, built on the AIF360 platform, with features like dataset integration, fairness interventions, batch-processing interfaces, and automatic metric reporting.

Result: FairPrep provides standard pipelines for reproducible evaluations, enabling efficient benchmarking of data-level fairness techniques.

Conclusion: FairPrep bridges the gap in fairness benchmarking for pre-processing methods and lays a foundation for advancing research in this area.

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes
decision-making processes, ensuring fairness in algorithmic outcomes has become
a critical concern. Methods to mitigate bias typically fall into three
categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. While
significant attention has been devoted to the latter two, pre-processing
methods, which operate at the data level and offer advantages such as
model-agnosticism and improved privacy compliance, have received comparatively
less focus and lack standardised evaluation tools. In this work, we introduce
FairPrep, an extensible and modular benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets. Built on the
AIF360 platform, FairPrep allows seamless integration of datasets, fairness
interventions, and predictive models. It features a batch-processing interface
that enables efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and
utility metrics. By offering standardised pipelines and supporting reproducible
evaluations, FairPrep fills a critical gap in the fairness benchmarking
landscape and provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the Frequency Principle limitation in Tensor Neural Networks, which restricts their ability to handle high-frequency features in high-dimensional problems.

Method: Fourier analysis is applied to train TNNs. Random Fourier features and Discrete Fourier Transform of one-dimensional component functions are incorporated to improve expressivity and mitigate dimensionality challenges.

Result: Frequency-adaptive TNNs demonstrate significant performance improvements when solving high-dimensional multi-scale problems in various numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs algorithm enhances the capability of TNNs for high-dimensional and multi-scale complex problems, showing both robustness and effectiveness.

Abstract: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in solving
high-dimensional problems. However, similar to conventional neural networks,
TNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability
to accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we
analyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their
expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random
Fourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further
propose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional
functions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional
component functions. This strategy effectively mitigates the curse of
dimensionality. Building on this idea, we propose a frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm, which significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex
multi-scale problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sleep stage classification is critical for diagnosing sleep disorders but manual evaluation has challenges like human errors, and current machine learning methods struggle with EEG/EOG signal variability and generalization to unseen datasets.

Method: The authors propose SleepDIFFormer, a Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture, which processes EEG/EOG signals, minimizes spatial/temporal attention noise, and aligns feature distributions across domains for domain-invariant representations.

Result: Their method achieved state-of-the-art performance across five sleep staging datasets, validated through empirical evaluations and ablation analyses.

Conclusion: SleepDIFFormer enhances automated sleep stage classification and generalization to diverse datasets, aiding in sleep quality assessments and addressing challenges in current methods.

Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and
diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia. However, manual inspection of EEG
characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error.
Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively
developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and
variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG)
signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research
proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate
Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation
learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG
signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for
time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial
and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG
representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling
generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method
on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough
ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention
weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns.
These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage
classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code

### [202] [See Beyond a Single View: Multi-Attribution Learning Leads to Better Conversion Rate Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15217)
*Sishuo Chen,Zhangming Chan,Xiang-Rong Sheng,Lei Zhang,Sheng Chen,Chenghuan Hou,Han Zhu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Multi-Attribution Learning framework for CVR prediction to utilize signals from multiple attribution perspectives, enhancing model performance and driving better user conversion predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CVR prediction approaches rely on labels from a single attribution mechanism, missing complementary insights from alternative perspectives. The paper seeks to integrate these insights to better capture user conversion patterns.

Method: The authors propose MAL, a joint learning framework with two components: (1) Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) - a multi-task learner integrating diverse attribution labels, and (2) Primary Target Predictor (PTP) - generating conversion probabilities aligned with a specific attribution metric. They also introduce CAT, a training strategy leveraging combinations of attribution labels for richer supervision.

Result: Empirical evaluations reveal +0.51% GAUC improvement in offline metrics compared to single-attribution baselines, while online experiments report a +2.6% increase in ROI.

Conclusion: The MAL framework effectively incorporates multi-attribution signals for CVR prediction, leading to superior offline and online performance with potential for significant industrial deployment.

Abstract: Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is a core component of online advertising
systems, where the attribution mechanisms-rules for allocating conversion
credit across user touchpoints-fundamentally determine label generation and
model optimization. While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution
mechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch
Attribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a
single production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary
signals in alternative attribution perspectives.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning
(MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple
attribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user
conversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two
core components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary
Target Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that
integrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in
contrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion
probabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g.,
CVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with
industrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel
training strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label
combinations to generate enriched supervision signals. This design
substantially enhances the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of MAL over

### [203] [Locally Pareto-Optimal Interpretations for Black-Box Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15220)
*Aniruddha Joshi,Supratik Chakraborty,S Akshay,Shetal Shah,Hazem Torfah,Sanjit Seshia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study develops a framework for synthesizing Pareto-optimal interpretations of black-box models focusing on accuracy and explainability. It integrates multi-objective search techniques with local optimality verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the need for scalable and trustworthy techniques to balance the trade-off between interpretability and accuracy in understanding black-box models.

Method: The method combines Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search to generate Pareto-optimal candidates and uses SAT solvers to verify their local optimality.

Result: The framework produces interpretations comparable to global guarantee methods, while improving scalability for exploring Pareto-optimal solutions.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable and effective way to synthesize locally Pareto-optimal interpretations for black-box models, striking a balance between accuracy and explainability.

Abstract: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models
involves balancing two often conflicting objectives: accuracy and
explainability. Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential
for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for
multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically
lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do
provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability
limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we
develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more
scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of
synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality
guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach
begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as
Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of
Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then
verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,
which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the
Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our
approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods
offering global guarantees.

*Yi Yuan,Joseph Van Duyn,Runze Yan,Zhuoyi Huang,Sulaiman Vesal,Sergey Plis,Xiao Hu,Gloria Hyunjung Kwak,Ran Xiao,Alex Fedorov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a poly-window contrastive learning method for better ECG representation learning, improving performance while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for ECG analysis are hindered by limited labeled data and fail to utilize the rich temporal structure of ECG effectively.

Method: The study presents a poly-window contrastive learning framework that generates multiple temporal windows of ECG data, encouraging learning of temporally invariant features and utilizing statistics for efficient representation.

Result: The method outperformed conventional two-view methods on the PTB-XL dataset with higher AUROC and F1 scores while requiring fewer pre-training epochs and computing time.

Conclusion: Poly-window contrastive learning is efficient, scalable, and a promising approach for self-supervised learning of biomedical time-series data, especially for automated ECG analysis.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease
diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by
limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has
emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from
unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise
augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG
recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning
framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to
construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired
by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages
the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features
that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate
that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional
two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher
AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to
four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock
pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we
achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total
computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.
Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate
robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window
contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated
ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised
representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

tasks and the latest open-source models, including Qwen 3 and GPT-OSS series.
Notably, on challenging benchmarks such as AIME 2025, DeepConf@512 achieves up
to 99.9% accuracy and reduces generated tokens by up to 84.7% compared to full

*Haji Gul,Abul Ghani Naim,Ajaz Ahmad Bhat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study evaluates the CSG metric in multi-relational link prediction on KGs and finds it sensitive to parametrization and weakly correlated with standard performance metrics. Other complexity metrics are proposed as more reliable alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate the validity and applicability of the Cumulative Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric in understanding dataset complexity for link prediction models on Knowledge Graphs (KGs).

Method: Critically analyze CSG's sensitivity, correlation with performance metrics, and introduce new complexity metrics for benchmarking structural and semantic dataset features.

Result: CSG is sensitive to parameterization and does not correlate reliably with established metrics like MRR and Hit@1. Relational ambiguity metrics showed stronger inverse correlations with MRR and Hit@1, while graph connectivity measures correlated positively with Hit@10.

Conclusion: CSG is unsuitable for link prediction tasks on KGs, highlighting the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-specific complexity metrics for knowledge-driven learning.

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

*Zhaorui Tan,Yijie Hu,Xi Yang,Qiufeng Wang,Anh Nguyen,Kaizhu Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents PL-Reg, a novel method leveraging partial-logic regularization to improve adaptability and generalization in handling unknown classes across various classification tasks, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of handling unknown classes in visual classification, which current paradigms either overlook or manage poorly due to biases towards known classes or catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Introduces PL-Reg, a partial-logic regularization term that enables models to accommodate undefined logic formulas, enhancing their adaptability to unknown classes.

Result: The paper shows, through formal demonstrations and extensive experiments on multiple tasks, that PL-Reg leads to consistent and improved generalization performance.

Conclusion: Partial logic effectively improves adaptability and generalization in visual classification tasks, particularly when addressing unknown classes, as validated by the competitive performance of PL-Reg methods.

Abstract: Generalization remains a significant challenge in visual classification
tasks, particularly in handling unknown classes in real-world applications.
Existing research focuses on the class discovery paradigm, which tends to favor
known classes, and the incremental learning paradigm, which suffers from
catastrophic forgetting. Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ
logic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the
necessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown
classes. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization
term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas,
improving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally
demonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained
using partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to
improved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on
Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery,
and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of partial
logic in tackling challenges related to unknown classes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents ExBigBang, a hybrid text-tabular model for persona classification that enhances explainability and integrates contextual features to better reflect user behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of contextualizing persona development for user-centric design by integrating textual and tabular data and improving model explainability.

Method: Developed ExBigBang, a hybrid transformer-based model that merges textual and tabular data, incorporates metadata and domain knowledge, employs a cyclical user profiling process, and includes explainable AI techniques.

Result: ExBigBang demonstrated robustness on a benchmark dataset for persona classification, with ablation studies confirming the synergy of text-tabular data integration.

Conclusion: ExBigBang advances contextual persona development by improving prediction interpretability and dynamically adapting to user behavior changes.

Abstract: In user-centric design, persona development plays a vital role in
understanding user behaviour, capturing needs, segmenting audiences, and
guiding design decisions. However, the growing complexity of user interactions
calls for a more contextualized approach to ensure designs align with real user
needs. While earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling
user behaviour, capturing contextual information, especially by integrating
textual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack
explainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify. To
address these limitations, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid
text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich
contextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates
metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into
predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification,
our approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.
Experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the
robustness of our model. An ablation study confirms the benefits of combining
text and tabular data, while Explainable AI techniques shed light on the
rationale behind the model's predictions.

*Omri Ben-Dov,Samira Samadi,Amartya Sanyal,Alexandru Ţifrea*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes that coordinated minority groups can strategize data relabeling to mitigate algorithmic bias without requiring changes to the firm's training processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models often perpetuate biases from training data, leading to unfair outcomes for minority groups. Existing bias mitigation methods typically require organizational cooperation and may reduce model utility.

Method: The authors introduce three practical, model-agnostic approaches for minority groups to strategically relabel their data as a way to reduce unfairness in ML models.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets reveal that a coordinated subgroup of a minority can significantly reduce unfairness with minimal impact on prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: Strategically relabeling data by minority user groups offers a viable, decentralized method to remediate algorithmic bias while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data,
leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Despite an array of
existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques, they typically incur utility
costs and require organizational buy-in. Recognizing that many models rely on
user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of
Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically
relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training
process. We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate
ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets. Our findings show
that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a
small impact on the overall prediction error.

*Haodi Zhong,Liuxin Zou,Di Wang,Bo Wang,Zhenxing Niu,Quan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EvoFormer, a Transformer-based method addressing biases in dynamic graph-level embeddings caused by high-degree nodes and rigid temporal modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic graph embedding methods suffer from Structural Visit Bias (overemphasis on high-degree nodes) and Abrupt Evolution Blindness (failure to detect sudden structural changes).

Method: EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module to handle node role differentiation and an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal Module for timestamp classification, graph segmentation, and temporal self-attention.

Result: EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on tasks like graph similarity ranking, anomaly detection, and segmentation, on five benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: EvoFormer effectively addresses structural and temporal biases, enabling more accurate and adaptive dynamic graph representations.

Abstract: Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in
networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit
Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree
nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt
Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural
changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies,
resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we
propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for
dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias,
EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates
positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to
globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome
Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal
Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential
three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating
initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal
Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting
structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention
combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to
precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends,
effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five
benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance
in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal
segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and
temporal biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of large-scale, heterogeneous text-attributed graph datasets hinders the progression and fair evaluation of representation learning methods in this domain.

Method: CITE comprises over 438K nodes, 1.2M edges across four relation types, and includes standardized evaluation protocols and extensive benchmarks. The study evaluates node classification tasks using four learning paradigms.

Result: The paper defines the CITE dataset's structure, conducts benchmarking and ablation studies, and demonstrates its ability to support both heterogeneous and textual graph properties.

Conclusion: CITE provides a foundational dataset with standardized methods and diverse baseline experiments, enabling better development of models for heterogeneous text-attributed graphs.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized
evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods face limitations in decentralized data processing, requiring predefined clusters and sharing raw data. This paper aims to overcome these issues using a more flexible system based on Federated Learning.

Method: The paper utilizes an Evolving Fuzzy System within Federated Learning that adapts to new clusters dynamically. The implementation leverages PyTorch for evaluation across clustering and classification tasks.

Result: The method showed better performance compared to existing classification approaches in experiments conducted on popular UCI datasets, despite the computational challenges.

Conclusion: This approach highlights the benefits of dynamic cluster adaptation and decentralized processing in machine learning tasks, offering advancements over traditional methods despite increased computation costs.

Abstract: In this study, we present an Evolving Fuzzy System within the context of
Federated Learning, which adapts dynamically with the addition of new clusters
and therefore does not require the number of clusters to be selected apriori.
Unlike traditional methods, Federated Learning allows models to be trained
locally on clients' devices, sharing only the model parameters with a central
server instead of the data. Our method, implemented using PyTorch, was tested
on clustering and classification tasks. The results show that our approach
outperforms established classification methods on several well-known UCI
datasets. While computationally intensive due to overlap condition
calculations, the proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in
decentralized data processing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid least squares/gradient descent approach to enhance DeepONet training by separating a large computational problem into smaller, manageable ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency and infeasibility of current training methods for DeepONet, particularly with large LS systems.

Method: Utilizes hybrid optimization by combining least squares for last-layer parameters and gradient descent for hidden layers. Decomposes the large LS system into two smaller, independent subproblems for separate optimization.

Result: Efficiently handles training for large-scale DeepONet applications while incorporating generalizations such as physics-informed losses.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves DeepONet training efficiency and supports complex loss structures, making it applicable to broader scenarios.

Abstract: We propose an efficient hybrid least squares/gradient descent method to
accelerate DeepONet training. Since the output of DeepONet can be viewed as
linear with respect to the last layer parameters of the branch network, these
parameters can be optimized using a least squares (LS) solve, and the remaining
hidden layer parameters are updated by means of gradient descent form. However,
building the LS system for all possible combinations of branch and trunk inputs
yields a prohibitively large linear problem that is infeasible to solve
directly. To address this issue, our method decomposes the large LS system into
two smaller, more manageable subproblems $\unicode{x2014}$ one for the branch
network and one for the trunk network $\unicode{x2014}$ and solves them
separately. This method is generalized to a broader type of $L^2$ loss with a
regularization term for the last layer parameters, including the case of
unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid framework for personalized Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on wearable devices, achieving improved accuracy by using few-shot learning implemented directly on embedded platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient personalization of HAR models, which suffer from user-induced concept drift affects generalization when deployed to new users.

Method: The framework generalizes across users first, then adapts to individual users using few-shot learning. It updates only the classifier layer with user-specific data, implemented on energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller.

Result: Post-deployment adaptation improved accuracy by 3.73%, 17.38%, and 3.70% across three HAR scenarios.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of fast, lightweight, and effective personalization on embedded platforms, enabling scalable and user-aware HAR systems in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices has advanced
significantly in recent years, yet its generalization remains limited when
models are deployed to new users. This degradation in performance is primarily
due to user-induced concept drift (UICD), highlighting the importance of
efficient personalization. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that
first generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users
using few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier
layer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with
minimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the
energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three
diverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture.
Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\%,
17.38\%, and 3.70\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight,
and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way
for scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild

*Miha Ožbot,Igor Škrjanc*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fast measure to detect overlapping clusters in multivariate Gaussian data for streaming data applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve clustering models for streaming data by addressing the limitations of current dissimilarity measures in detecting overlapping clusters.

Method: The development of a dissimilarity measure tailored to detect overlapping clusters, optimized for computational efficiency.

Result: The proposed method is considerably faster than existing ones and effectively identifies overlapping clusters without merging orthogonal ones.

Conclusion: The measure offers a significant improvement for online clustering, enabling faster and more accurate detection of overlapping clusters in streaming data.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new measure for detecting overlap in multivariate
Gaussian clusters. The aim of online learning from data streams is to create
clustering, classification, or regression models that can adapt over time based
on the conceptual drift of streaming data. In the case of clustering, this can
result in a large number of clusters that may overlap and should be merged.
Commonly used distribution dissimilarity measures are not adequate for
determining overlapping clusters in the context of online learning from
streaming data due to their inability to account for all shapes of clusters and
their high computational demands. Our proposed dissimilarity measure is
specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity and can be
computed faster compared to existing measures. Our method is several times
faster than compared methods and is capable of detecting overlapping clusters
while avoiding the merging of orthogonal clusters.

*Chengcan Wu,Zeming Wei,Huanran Chen,Yinpeng Dong,Meng Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method called Metamorphosis Representation Projection (MRP) to enhance machine unlearning in Large Language Models, addressing existing methods' vulnerabilities to relearning attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the critical issue of unsafe knowledge embedded in large language models, which existing methods fail to fully eradicate, leaving models susceptible to relearning attacks.

Method: The proposed MRP approach employs irreversible projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network layers to eliminate harmful information while retaining useful knowledge.

Result: MRP achieves state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness and successfully defends against relearning attacks, as validated by experimental results.

Conclusion: The proposed method represents a significant advance in machine unlearning, ensuring both the elimination of unsafe knowledge and the preservation of model utility.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming
increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge
internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to
ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques,
such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to
eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these
methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric
training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the
model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective
continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning
attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis
Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of
irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing
projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network
layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving
useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables
effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning
attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness
while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in

Motivation: To explore how a molecular switch model can emulate brain-like synaptic functions and ensure stability in processing sequential data.

Method: Investigated a solvable one-state differential equation model with linear state and nonlinear input dynamics, analyzing its mathematical properties.

Result: The model demonstrates convergence, fading memory, and stable input processing outputs, making it compatible with neuromorphic computing architectures.

Conclusion: The findings support molecular switches as computational units and may inspire new models for brain-like stable computational devices.

Abstract: This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model
initially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch
that switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and
nonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also
possesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable
stable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus,
the model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and
desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The
results give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches
as computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent
architectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic
computing. They could also inspire more general exactly solvable models that
can be fitted to emulate arbitrary physical devices which can mimic

### [219] [Learning Protein-Ligand Binding in Hyperbolic Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15480)
*Jianhui Wang,Wenyu Zhu,Bowen Gao,Xin Hong,Ya-Qin Zhang,Wei-Ying Ma,Yanyan Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HypSeek, a hyperbolic representation learning framework that leverages hyperbolic space for protein-ligand binding prediction, improving virtual screening and affinity ranking accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent methods embedding ligands and protein pockets in Euclidean space struggle to capture molecular interaction hierarchies and detailed affinity variations, necessitating a better representation space.

Method: HypSeek employs the Lorentz-model hyperbolic space for expressive embeddings of ligands and proteins, using a protein-guided three-tower architecture to unify virtual screening and affinity ranking.

Result: HypSeek achieved a 20.7% improvement in early enrichment (DUD-E) and a 25.4% improvement in affinity ranking correlation (JACS).

Conclusion: Hyperbolic geometry provides a robust inductive bias for modeling protein-ligand interactions, making HypSeek an effective tool for virtual screening and affinity ranking.

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding prediction is central to virtual screening and
affinity ranking, two fundamental tasks in drug discovery. While recent
retrieval-based methods embed ligands and protein pockets into Euclidean space
for similarity-based search, the geometry of Euclidean embeddings often fails
to capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations
intrinsic to molecular interactions. In this work, we propose HypSeek, a
hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein
pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. By leveraging the
exponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space, HypSeek
enables expressive, affinity-sensitive embeddings that can effectively model
both global activity and subtle functional differences-particularly in
challenging cases such as activity cliffs, where structurally similar ligands
exhibit large affinity gaps. Our mode unifies virtual screening and affinity
ranking in a single framework, introducing a protein-guided three-tower
architecture to enhance representational structure. HypSeek improves early
enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and
affinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%),
demonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic geometry across both tasks and
highlighting its potential as a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand
modeling.

*Jiahua Lu,Huaxiao Liu,Shuotong Bai,Junjie Xu,Renqiang Luo,Enyan Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents FairGuide, a framework that improves fairness in graph neural networks (GNNs) by introducing fairness-guided edge modifications, showcasing effectiveness across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are prone to fairness challenges due to structural biases present in graphs, necessitating methods to mitigate this issue for equitable downstream applications.

Method: FairGuide introduces a differentiable community detection task as a pseudo-task to guide structural fairness. The method uses meta-gradients from the fairness-guidance objective to create unbiased graph structures by adding new links.

Result: Experimental results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of FairGuide in improving fairness across diverse graph-based tasks.

Conclusion: FairGuide successfully addresses structural bias in graph neural networks, improving fairness in downstream applications and demonstrating broad applicability.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural
networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user
graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing
structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance
via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in
downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained
on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection
task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates
that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances
structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse
downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy
which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to
identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new ADMM-based algorithm for distributed learning over undirected networks, enhancing computational and communication efficiency with stochastic gradients, multiple local epochs, and compressed transmissions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in distributed learning systems, like high computation and communication overhead, by improving both training and transmission processes.

Method: The authors developed an ADMM-based algorithm utilizing stochastic gradients for local training, multiple training epochs to reduce communication frequency, and compressed transmissions. The theoretical guarantee of exact linear convergence is provided under strongly convex settings.

Result: The proposed algorithm demonstrates exact linear convergence and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in numerical classification tasks.

Conclusion: The algorithm achieves significant computational and communication advantages, presenting a scalable solution for distributed learning over undirected networks.

Abstract: We address distributed learning problems over undirected networks.
Specifically, we focus on designing a novel ADMM-based algorithm that is
jointly computation- and communication-efficient. Our design guarantees
computational efficiency by allowing agents to use stochastic gradients during
local training. Moreover, communication efficiency is achieved as follows: i)
the agents perform multiple training epochs between communication rounds, and
ii) compressed transmissions are used. We prove exact linear convergence of the
algorithm in the strongly convex setting. We corroborate our theoretical
results by numerical comparisons with state of the art techniques on a
classification task.

### [222] [Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function: Differential Privacy without Gradient Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15523)
*Salman Habib,Remi Chou,Taejoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPOF, a differentially private and efficient training mechanism, which applies noise to stabilize loss functions rather than gradients, achieving better privacy and performance in multi-user scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current differentially private training mechanisms, like DP-SGD, face limitations in multi-user settings due to computational inefficiencies, instability, and degraded performance under environmental noise.

Method: SPOF perturbs stabilized Taylor-expanded polynomial approximations of the loss function, adding calibrated noise to the polynomial coefficients rather than to gradients, ensuring computational efficiency and stability.

Result: SPOF achieved up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and a 57.2% reduction in mean training time compared to multi-user DP-SGD in a WBAN scenario faced with heterogeneous data and stochastic noise.

Conclusion: SPOF provides a robust, efficient, and privacy-preserving mechanism tailored for multi-user environments, outperforming traditional approaches like DP-SGD in both accuracy and training time.

Abstract: We propose SPOF (Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function), a differentially
private training mechanism intended for multi-user local differential privacy
(LDP). SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of a
model's training loss function, where each user's data is privatized by
calibrated noise added to the coefficients of the polynomial. Unlike
gradient-based mechanisms such as differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD), SPOF does not require injecting noise into the gradients of
the loss function, which improves both computational efficiency and stability.
This formulation naturally supports simultaneous privacy guarantees across all
users. Moreover, SPOF exhibits robustness to environmental noise during
training, maintaining stable performance even when user inputs are corrupted.
We compare SPOF with a multi-user extension of DP-SGD, evaluating both methods
in a wireless body area network (WBAN) scenario involving heterogeneous user
data and stochastic channel noise from body sensors. Our results show that SPOF
achieves, on average, up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces
mean training time by up to 57.2% compared to DP-SGD, demonstrating superior
privacy-utility trade-offs in multi-user environments.

TL;DR: This study proposes a machine learning-based approach for early fault detection in industrial pumps using real-world sensor data, a dual-threshold labeling system, and synthetic fault signal injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust, scalable, and interpretable fault detection method for industrial pumps operating in demanding environments, addressing the rarity of documented failures.

Method: The study monitors five operational parameters and employs a dual-threshold labeling method. It injects synthetic fault signals to simulate critical alerts and trains three machine learning classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM) to categorize operational states.

Result: Random Forest and XGBoost performed well in detecting both common and rare faults, while SVM had lower anomaly sensitivity. The hybrid framework demonstrated effectiveness in distinguishing operational states and supporting proactive maintenance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is practical for real-time industrial use and can be adapted for other machinery with similar sensor architectures, offering scalable predictive maintenance capabilities.

Abstract: This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in
industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale
vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key
operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate,
pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied,
combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the
95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of
documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using
domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating
ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to
distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts.
Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy
across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging
faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual
analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated
that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The
framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial
deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur.
Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor
architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive
maintenance in complex systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance and interpretability of machine learning models are crucial, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance, where high-stakes decisions are made.

Method: The authors propose a framework that combines Conformal Prediction with Exceptional Model Mining, introduce a new model (mSMoPE) to evaluate uncertainty, and define a new quality measure (RAUL) to isolate subgroups with unique performance patterns.

Result: The framework effectively identifies interpretable subgroups with significant insights into model behavior across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The study provides a novel approach to improve machine learning model interpretability and reliability, contributing to the fields of explainable AI and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Understanding the nuanced performance of machine learning models is essential
for responsible deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare
and finance. This paper introduces a novel framework, Conformalized Exceptional
Model Mining, which combines the rigor of Conformal Prediction with the
explanatory power of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM). The proposed framework
identifies cohesive subgroups within data where model performance deviates
exceptionally, highlighting regions of both high confidence and high
uncertainty. We develop a new model class, mSMoPE (multiplex Soft Model
Performance Evaluation), which quantifies uncertainty through conformal
prediction's rigorous coverage guarantees. By defining a new quality measure,
Relative Average Uncertainty Loss (RAUL), our framework isolates subgroups with
exceptional performance patterns in multi-class classification and regression
tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical
insights into model behavior. This work lays the groundwork for enhancing model
interpretability and reliability, advancing the state-of-the-art in explainable
AI and uncertainty quantification.

*Ortal Senouf,Antoine Wehenkel,Cédric Vincent-Cuaz,Emmanuel Abbé,Pascal Frossard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an improved framework for simulation-based inference (SBI) that overcomes model misspecifications and enhances scalability by integrating calibration and distributional alignment in a single model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulation-based inference (SBI) struggles with model misspecification, limiting its ability to handle discrepancies between simulations and real-world data while maintaining scalability and generalization.

Method: The paper introduces a fully inductive and amortized SBI framework using mini-batch optimal transport (OT) and conditional normalizing flow. This design allows end-to-end training for bridging simulated and real-world observations, leveraging both paired and unpaired data.

Result: The proposed method matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art approaches (like RoPE) on benchmarks that include synthetic and real-world tasks, showing better scalability and handling of model misspecifications.

Conclusion: By enabling a scalable, end-to-end solution for SBI in misspecified environments, the proposed method improves applicability and maintains high inference accuracy without requiring batch test data at inference time.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for
estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is
intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered
by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world
observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI
approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process
that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based
distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting,
requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits
scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized
SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a
single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a
closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond
to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired
samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the
OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at
test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including
complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the
performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators,
while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging,
misspecified environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), addressing the challenge of continual learning in topic modeling, where new topic models are learned without forgetting previous ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of Dynamic and Online Topic Models, both of which fail to address the need for long-term memory and continual learning of topic evolution.

Method: The authors propose CoNTM utilizing a global prior distribution that is continuously updated to effectively learn and retain topic models over time.

Result: Experiments show that CoNTM outperforms Dynamic Topic Models in terms of topic quality, predictive perplexity, and the ability to capture topic changes online.

Conclusion: CoNTM demonstrates superior performance in continual topic learning by delivering more diverse topics and better capturing temporal changes than existing methods.

Abstract: In continual learning, our aim is to learn a new task without forgetting what
was learned previously. In topic models, this translates to learning new topic
models without forgetting previously learned topics. Previous work either
considered Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs), which learn the evolution of topics
based on the entire training corpus at once, or Online Topic Models, which are
updated continuously based on new data but do not have long-term memory. To
fill this gap, we propose the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), which
continuously learns topic models at subsequent time steps without forgetting
what was previously learned. This is achieved using a global prior distribution
that is continuously updated. In our experiments, CoNTM consistently
outperformed the dynamic topic model in terms of topic quality and predictive
perplexity while being able to capture topic changes online. The analysis
reveals that CoNTM can learn more diverse topics and better capture temporal
changes than existing methods.

*Wei Herng Choong,Jixing Liu,Ching-Yu Kao,Philip Sperl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRASPED, an unsupervised graph autoencoder for node anomaly detection, leveraging spectral and wavelet analysis to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve anomaly detection on graphs by overcoming limitations of labeled data scarcity in supervised methods and the restricted spectral analysis capabilities of existing unsupervised approaches.

Method: The proposed GRASPED model includes a Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder and a Wiener Graph Deconvolution-based decoder, enabling multi-band spectral analysis for reconstructing node attributes and detecting anomalies.

Result: GRASPED achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in various real-world graph anomaly detection datasets.

Conclusion: GRASPED effectively addresses the challenges in anomaly detection on graphs by combining spectral techniques and unsupervised learning, making it a robust solution in this domain.

Abstract: Graph machine learning has been widely explored in various domains, such as
community detection, transaction analysis, and recommendation systems. In these
applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have
shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods
have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However,
they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of
anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches
predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters,
thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose
Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node
anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on
Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The
Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph
Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that
capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design
allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively
capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world
graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current
state-of-the-art models.

*Lucas Gautheron,Evan Kidd,Anton Malko,Marvin Lavechin,Alejandrina Cristia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the impact of classification errors in automated audio analysis for studying children's language experiences and offers a Bayesian method to mitigate these errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on how errors in automated classification affect statistical measurements and key scientific conclusions in studies of language acquisition.

Method: A Bayesian calibration approach is proposed to examine and correct the errors in automated tools like LENA and ACLEW Voice Type Classifier, particularly their effect on estimated correlations and regression outcomes.

Result: Classification errors were found to distort important estimates, such as underestimating the effect of siblings on adult input by 20–80%. Bayesian calibration showed promise in recovering unbiased estimates, though it remains an imperfect solution.

Conclusion: Errors in audio classifiers can significantly impact scientific findings, but Bayesian calibration offers a practical tool for mitigating these effects, potentially relevant across diverse classifier applications.

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier
involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

*Ruihan Zhang,Jun Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to guarantee individual fairness during machine learning training by using provable methods and randomised response mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning algorithms often fail to ensure individual fairness, leading to ethical concerns in real-world applications.

Method: The framework includes fair model initialization and a fairness-preserving training algorithm, both backed by randomised response mechanisms for ensuring fairness.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method achieves empirical fairness and accuracy efficiently, outperforming certification-based alternatives.

Conclusion: The approach offers a novel and efficient way to guarantee individual fairness during training, addressing gaps in existing fairness optimization methods.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is more important than ever as ethical concerns
continue to grow. Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only
in sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used
machine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve
individual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as
incorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these
methods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees
of fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees
primarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce
definitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance
individual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a
novel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout
training. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair
initialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a
fairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model
learns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response
mechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness
guarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness
throughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our
approach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and
accurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative
approach based on certified training (which requires neural network
verification during training).

TL;DR: This paper introduces AICMET, a transformer-based approach combining Bayesian inference and pharmacokinetic modeling for precise drug dose forecasting, focusing on fast and accurate predictions with minimal patient data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve precision pharmacotherapy through accurate dose-response predictions using models that adapt quickly to new drugs and patients, even with limited data.

Method: The paper proposes AICMET, a transformer-based latent-variable framework that integrates mechanistic compartmental priors with in-context Bayesian inference. AICMET is pre-trained on synthetic pharmacokinetic data and makes zero-shot predictions for new cases by conditioning on prior patient data.

Result: AICMET achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy and effectively captures inter-patient variability, outperforming traditional nonlinear mixed-effects models and neural ODE techniques.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of transformer-based approaches for personalized pharmacokinetic modeling, reducing model-development time while maintaining accuracy and adaptability for individualized therapy.

Abstract: Accurate dose-response forecasting under sparse sampling is central to
precision pharmacotherapy. We present the Amortized In-Context Mixed-Effect
Transformer (AICMET) model, a transformer-based latent-variable framework that
unifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian
inference. AICMET is pre-trained on hundreds of thousands of synthetic
pharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors over the parameters
of compartment models, endowing the model with strong inductive biases and
enabling zero-shot adaptation to new compounds. At inference time, the decoder
conditions on the collective context of previously profiled trial participants,
generating calibrated posterior predictions for newly enrolled patients after a
few early drug concentration measurements. This capability collapses
traditional model-development cycles from weeks to hours while preserving some
degree of expert modelling. Experiments across public datasets show that AICMET
attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy and faithfully quantifies
inter-patient variability -- outperforming both nonlinear mixed-effects
baselines and recent neural ODE variants. Our results highlight the feasibility
of transformer-based, population-aware neural architectures as offering a new
alternative for bespoke pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, charting a path
toward truly population-aware personalized dosing regimens.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new open-ended multi-agent environment that reflects real-world challenges, enabling research on developing socially intelligent AI agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of studying AI social intelligence due to a lack of open-ended multi-agent environments that mimic real-world settings.

Method: The authors create an environment where self-interested agents pursue complex, independent goals, promoting behaviors like implicit cooperation (e.g., tool-sharing) and competition.

Result: Social learning in the presence of experts, as well as emergent cooperative and competitive behaviors, impacts agent performance.

Conclusion: The proposed environment facilitates studying the development of adaptive, socially intelligent behaviors in AI agents in realistic settings with both cooperative and competitive dynamics.

Abstract: Many challenges remain before AI agents can be deployed in real-world
environments. However, one virtue of such environments is that they are
inherently multi-agent and contain human experts. Using advanced social
intelligence in such an environment can help an AI agent learn adaptive skills
and behaviors that a known expert exhibits. While social intelligence could
accelerate training, it is currently difficult to study due to the lack of
open-ended multi-agent environments. In this work, we present an environment in
which multiple self-interested agents can pursue complex and independent goals,
reflective of real world challenges. This environment will enable research into
the development of socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent
settings, where agents may be implicitly incentivized to cooperate to defeat
common enemies, build and share tools, and achieve long horizon goals. In this
work, we investigate the impact on agent performance due to social learning in
the presence of experts and implicit cooperation such as emergent collaborative
tool use, and whether agents can benefit from either cooperation or competition
in this environment.

*Qifeng Hu,Shamsulhaq Basir,Inanc Senocak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces multiple advancements to the PECANN framework, improving its ability to solve PDEs through methods like generalized penalty strategies, efficient mini-batch training, Fourier feature mappings, and a conditionally adaptive penalty update method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research is motivated by the need for robust, efficient, and versatile computational tools to solve challenging PDEs with oscillatory or multi-scale behaviors, addressing limitations in existing neural network-based approaches.

Method: The authors propose improvements including a generalized ALM with independent penalties, reformulated constraint enforcement as expectations, Fourier feature mappings, a time-windowing strategy for long-time problems, and CAPU for adaptive constraint enforcement during training.

Result: The PECANN-CAPU framework demonstrated strong performance across various PDE problems, showing competitive accuracy when compared to existing methods and newer approaches like Kolmogorov-Arnold networks.

Conclusion: The proposed advancements significantly enhance the PECANN framework's capability, robustness, and efficiency, making it a competitive tool for solving complex PDEs in scientific computing.

Abstract: We present several advances to the physics and equality constrained
artificial neural networks (PECANN) framework that substantially improve its
capability to learn solutions of canonical partial differential equations
(PDEs). First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support
multiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of
heterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint
enforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms,
reducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third,
to address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier
feature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple
mappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth,
we introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the
terminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint
for the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we
propose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which
preserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger
penalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively
challenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the
transonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex,
high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of
spatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent
Kolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive
accuracy across all cases. Collectively, these advances improve PECANN's
robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding problems in scientific
computing.

*Amir Sarfi,Benjamin Thérien,Joel Lidin,Eugene Belilovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SparseLoCo is a training algorithm for Large Language Models (LLMs) that achieves high communication efficiency using Top-k sparsification and quantization, outperforming prior methods in communication-constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional training methods for LLMs face communication bottlenecks, especially across data centers, and slight performance degradation compared to baselines. Existing techniques struggle to combine sparsification with quantization effectively.

Method: The authors introduce SparseLoCo, which employs Top-k sparsification and 2-bit quantization. It leverages local error feedback for outer momentum and sparse aggregation to improve performance while achieving extreme compression ratios.

Result: SparseLoCo achieves 1-3% sparsity and extreme communication compression, while demonstrating improved or comparable performance to full-precision methods in communication-constrained LLM training scenarios.

Conclusion: SparseLoCo significantly improves communication efficiency and performance for LLM training in bandwidth-limited settings, advancing the state of communication-efficient training techniques.

Abstract: Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received
considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across data
centers and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these
methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's
gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter
links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive
AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to
reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing
approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have
obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a
communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages
Top-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up
to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision
DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally
approximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that
sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically
demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that
SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication
cost.

*Mohammed Elmusrati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reviews how classical estimation theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep learning, address uncertainty in noisy data, offering a unified mathematical framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile classical estimation methods and modern machine learning by showcasing their shared probabilistic principles for addressing uncertainty.

Method: Analyzes techniques like maximum likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms through illustrative scenarios in tasks like system identification, image classification, and language generation.

Result: Demonstrates the shared probabilistic basis of methods such as maximum likelihood, Bayesian classification, and deep learning in addressing challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability.

Conclusion: Provides a theoretical synthesis and practical guide for understanding the probabilistic underpinnings of various machine learning methods, assisting researchers in navigating the field.

Abstract: Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across
time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey
presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation
theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep
learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum
likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address
uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared
probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system
identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how
increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical
challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other
words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian
classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared
goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves
as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and
researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.

### [235] [Probability Density from Latent Diffusion Models for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15737)
*Joonas Järve,Karl Kaspar Haavel,Meelis Kull*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of a likelihood-based method for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in generative models and compares its performance to state-of-the-art methods by utilizing representation spaces of pre-trained ResNet-18.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the safety bottleneck in deploying machine-learning systems by improving out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, a critical safety component.

Method: The authors trained a Variational Diffusion Model on the representation space of a pre-trained ResNet-18 to evaluate the effectiveness of likelihood-based OOD detection against state-of-the-art methods.

Result: The study investigates whether generative models' representation spaces, rather than pixel spaces, can overcome limitations in density estimation for OOD detection.

Conclusion: Likely representation spaces might be a better avenue for improving likelihood-based OOD detection, potentially addressing practical limitations.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying
machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution
detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution
as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the
data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD
data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.
However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising
doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the
representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density
estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space
typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational
Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained
ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Intern-S1, a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts model excelling in scientific professional fields and closing the gap between open-source and closed-source performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency and lag of general foundation models in high-value scientific domains compared to popular fields and closed-source models, advancing the capabilities towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

Method: The method involves creating the Intern-S1 model as a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 241 billion total parameters, extensively pre-trained on 5T tokens, followed by offline and online reinforcement learning with a Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) approach.

Result: Intern-S1 achieves competitive results in general reasoning tasks and outperforms open-source and even closed-source models in professional scientific tasks like molecular synthesis planning and reaction condition prediction.

Conclusion: Intern-S1 demonstrates the feasibility of specialized generalists in scientific professional fields, significantly closing the performance gap between open-source and closed-source models, while establishing new benchmarks in these domains.

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing
closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular
synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic
stabilities for crystals. Our models are available at

*Kiarash Kazari,Ezzeldin Shereen,György Dán*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel decentralized detector using deep neural networks to identify adversarial attacks in cooperative multi-agent systems with continuous action spaces, achieving impressive performance with AUC-ROC scores exceeding 0.95.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting adversarial attacks in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning systems is critical due to the potential vulnerabilities in these setups, especially with continuous action spaces where attacks can significantly disrupt performance.

Method: The paper introduces a decentralized statistical-based detection method using deep neural networks to define agents' normal behavior as multivariate Gaussian distributions. A two-sided CUSUM procedure is employed based on normality scores derived from predicted densities.

Result: The detector was tested on PettingZoo benchmarks against multiple state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods, showing high effectiveness in detecting impactful attacks with AUC-ROC scores above 0.95.

Conclusion: This approach provides a robust and effective solution to real-time detection of adversarial attacks, highlighting its superiority over discrete counterparts in multi-agent environments with continuous action spaces.

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative
multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a
decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the
agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior
of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to
approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian
distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality
score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This
characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting
deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of
anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent
PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and
our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful
adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by
achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all
evaluated environments.

TL;DR: This paper advances the application of transformers in multivariate polynomial decomposition, introducing synthetic data generation, supervised learning, and a novel reinforcement learning method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the NP-hard problem of multivariate polynomial decomposition, which is critical for applications in science and engineering.

Method: The authors develop synthetic data for model training, employ supervised learning on transformer models, and introduce BGRPO for enhanced reinforcement learning.

Result: BGRPO improves accuracy and reduces computational requirements while outperforming Mathematica in polynomial simplification tasks.

Conclusion: Transformers can tackle challenging algebraic problems with improved efficiency and accuracy through innovative training strategies and reinforcement learning methods.

Abstract: Recent efforts have extended the capabilities of transformers in logical
reasoning and symbolic computations. In this work, we investigate their
capacity for non-linear latent pattern discovery in the context of functional
decomposition, focusing on the challenging algebraic task of multivariate
polynomial decomposition. This problem, with widespread applications in science
and engineering, is proved to be NP-hard, and demands both precision and
insight. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a synthetic data
generation pipeline providing fine-grained control over problem complexity.
Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them
across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability.
Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a
rank-aware reinforcement learning method suitable for hard algebraic problems.
Finetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to
half, resulting in approximately 75% lower inference compute. Additionally, our
model demonstrates competitive performance in polynomial simplification,
outperforming Mathematica in various cases.

### [239] [A Scalable Trie Building Algorithm for High-Throughput Phyloanalysis of Wafer-Scale Digital Evolution Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15074)
*Vivaan Singhvi,Joey Wagner,Emily Dolson,Luis Zaman,Matthew Andres Moreno*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The authors propose an improved trie-building algorithm that significantly speeds up the reconstruction of phylogenies for large-scale agent-based digital evolution experiments, overcoming hardware constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address memory and compute bottlenecks in tracking and reconstructing phylogenies for large-scale digital evolution experiments, facilitated by advanced AI/ML hardware accelerators.

Method: They enhance hereditary stratigraphy algorithms with a new space-efficient trie-building algorithm to reconstruct phylogenies more efficiently from genetic markers.

Result: The new algorithm achieves a 300-fold speedup for 10,000-tip trees and enables reconstruction of massive datasets (1 billion genomes) in under 3 hours.

Conclusion: The advancements lay the groundwork for high-throughput phyloanalysis in large-scale digital evolution experiments, addressing limitations in current methods.

Abstract: Agent-based simulation platforms play a key role in enabling fast-to-run
evolution experiments that can be precisely controlled and observed in detail.
Availability of high-resolution snapshots of lineage ancestries from digital
experiments, in particular, is key to investigations of evolvability and
open-ended evolution, as well as in providing a validation testbed for
bioinformatics method development. Ongoing advances in AI/ML hardware
accelerator devices, such as the 850,000-processor Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine
(WSE), are poised to broaden the scope of evolutionary questions that can be
investigated in silico. However, constraints in memory capacity and locality
characteristic of these systems introduce difficulties in exhaustively tracking
phylogenies at runtime. To overcome these challenges, recent work on hereditary
stratigraphy algorithms has developed space-efficient genetic markers to
facilitate fully decentralized estimation of relatedness among digital
organisms. However, in existing work, compute time to reconstruct phylogenies
from these genetic markers has proven a limiting factor in achieving
large-scale phyloanalyses. Here, we detail an improved trie-building algorithm
designed to produce reconstructions equivalent to existing approaches. For
modestly-sized 10,000-tip trees, the proposed approach achieves a 300-fold
speedup versus existing state-of-the-art. Finally, using 1 billion genome
datasets drawn from WSE simulations encompassing 954 trillion replication
events, we report a pair of large-scale phylogeny reconstruction trials,
achieving end-to-end reconstruction times of 2.6 and 2.9 hours. In
substantially improving reconstruction scaling and throughput, presented work
establishes a key foundation to enable powerful high-throughput phyloanalysis
techniques in large-scale digital evolution experiments.

*John E. Hummel,Rachel F. Heaton*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper explores the mechanisms required for symbolic thought in humans, proposing that, along with dynamic binding, two hierarchical integration processes—multi-place predicates and structure mapping—are essential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain what differentiates human symbolic reasoning from other animals and identify the minimal cognitive mechanisms necessary for such thought.

Method: They used 17 systematic simulations comparing cognitive architectures with and without the capacity for multi-place predicates and structure mapping, ensuring tasks relied on these abilities rather than task-specific features.

Result: The simulations showed that combining dynamic binding with multi-place predicates and structure mapping facilitated symbolic reasoning, supporting the hypothesis.

Conclusion: The study underscores the roles of dynamic binding, multi-place predicates, and structure mapping in enabling symbolic thought, offering insights into human cognition and bio-inspired AI development.

Abstract: What is it about human brains that allows us to reason symbolically whereas
most other animals cannot? There is evidence that dynamic binding, the ability
to combine neurons into groups on the fly, is necessary for symbolic thought,
but there is also evidence that it is not sufficient. We propose that two kinds
of hierarchical integration (integration of multiple role-bindings into
multiplace predicates, and integration of multiple correspondences into
structure mappings) are minimal requirements, on top of basic dynamic binding,
to realize symbolic thought. We tested this hypothesis in a systematic
collection of 17 simulations that explored the ability of cognitive
architectures with and without the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping to perform various kinds of tasks. The simulations were as
generic as possible, in that no task could be performed based on any diagnostic
features, depending instead on the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that, along
with dynamic binding, multi-place predicates and structure mapping are minimal
requirements for basic symbolic thought. These results inform our understanding
of how human brains give rise to symbolic thought and speak to the differences
between biological intelligence, which tends to generalize broadly from very
few training examples, and modern approaches to machine learning, which
typically require millions or billions of training examples. The results we
report also have important implications for bio-inspired artificial
intelligence.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a homomorphism calculus to verify and optimize user-defined aggregation functions (UDAFs) for distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient execution of UDAFs in frameworks like Apache Spark and Flink requires them to satisfy the homomorphism property, enabling partial result merging and improved performance.

Method: Developed a homomorphism calculus to verify/refute whether a UDAF is a dataframe homomorphism and to construct a merge operator for incremental and parallel computation.

Result: Implemented the calculus in an algorithm and evaluated it on real-world UDAFs, showing significant performance improvements over leading synthesizers.

Conclusion: The proposed homomorphism calculus enables more efficient execution of UDAFs, aiding in incremental computation and achieving better performance in distributed data processing.

Abstract: Data processing frameworks like Apache Spark and Flink provide built-in
support for user-defined aggregation functions (UDAFs), enabling the
integration of domain-specific logic. However, for these frameworks to support
\emph{efficient} UDAF execution, the function needs to satisfy a
\emph{homomorphism property}, which ensures that partial results from
independent computations can be merged correctly. Motivated by this problem,
this paper introduces a novel \emph{homomorphism calculus} that can both verify
and refute whether a UDAF is a dataframe homomorphism. If so, our calculus also
enables the construction of a corresponding merge operator which can be used
for incremental computation and parallel execution. We have implemented an
algorithm based on our proposed calculus and evaluate it on real-world UDAFs,
demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms two leading
synthesizers.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: GPS is a new software model-checking algorithm that uses compositional static analysis for efficient bug detection and safety proof.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently finding bugs and proving program safety, especially in programs with long, input-dependent error paths.

Method: A compositional, summary-based static analysis directs state exploration. Static analysis summaries prune infeasible paths and guide test generation, complemented by a novel two-layered search strategy and an instrumentation technique for refutation-completeness.

Result: GPS outperformed state-of-the-art software model checkers in benchmarks, solving more benchmarks with faster runtimes.

Conclusion: GPS proves to be an efficient and refutationally complete model-checking algorithm, advancing the state-of-the-art in software verification.

Abstract: In this work, we describe a new software model-checking algorithm called GPS.
GPS treats the task of model checking a program as a directed search of the
program states, guided by a compositional, summary-based static analysis. The
summaries produced by static analysis are used both to prune away infeasible
paths and to drive test generation to reach new, unexplored program states. GPS
can find both proofs of safety and counter-examples to safety (i.e., inputs
that trigger bugs), and features a novel two-layered search strategy that
renders it particularly efficient at finding bugs in programs featuring long,
input-dependent error paths. To make GPS refutationally complete (in the sense
that it will find an error if one exists, if it is allotted enough time), we
introduce an instrumentation technique and show that it helps GPS achieve
refutation-completeness without sacrificing overall performance. We benchmarked
GPS on a suite of benchmarks including both programs from the Software
Verification Competition (SV-COMP) and from prior literature, and found that
our implementation of GPS outperforms state-of-the-art software model checkers
(including the top performers in SV-COMP ReachSafety-Loops category), both in
terms of the number of benchmarks solved and in terms of running time.

### [243] [Big-Stop Semantics: A Simple Way to Get the Benefits of Small-Step Semantics in a Big-Step Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15157)
*David M Kahn,Jan Hoffmann,Runming Li*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an extended big-step semantics, termed "big-stop semantics," that incorporates diverging computations without error states for various language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Big-step semantics is favored for ergonomics in describing dynamic program behaviors but lacks the capability to capture behaviors like divergence, which small-step semantics can address. The motivation is to extend big-step semantics to handle such scenarios while preserving simplicity.

Method: The authors propose "big-stop semantics," an extension of big-step semantics using inductive definitions combined with a minimal set of additional inference rules. This approach models computations equivalently to the reflexive-transitive closure of small-step transitions.

Result: The proposed big-stop semantics effectively handles divergence in programs and is applied to typed, untyped, and effectful variants of PCF, as well as imperative languages. The solution maintains fewer rules and avoids complicated reasoning principles like coinduction.

Conclusion: The big-stop semantics offers a practical, ergonomic extension to big-step semantics for representing divergence, improving on existing methods without sacrificing simplicity.

Abstract: As evident in the programming language literature, many practitioners favor
specifying dynamic program behavior using big-step over small-step semantics.
Unlike small-step semantics, which must dwell on every intermediate program
state, big-step semantics conveniently jump directly to the ever-important
result of the computation. Big-step semantics also typically involve fewer
inference rules than their small-step counterparts. However, in exchange for
ergonomics, big-step semantics give up power: Small-step semantics describes
program behaviors that are outside the grasp of big-step semantics, notably
divergence. This work presents a little-known extension of big-step semantics
with inductive definitions that captures diverging computations without
introducing error states. This big-stop semantics is illustrated for typed,
untyped, and effectful variants of PCF, as well as a while-loop-based
imperative language. Big-stop semantics extends the standard big-step inference
rules with a few additional rules to define an evaluation judgment that is
equivalent to the reflexive-transitive closure of small-step transitions. This
simple extension contrasts with other solutions in the literature which
sacrifice ergonomics by introducing many additional inference rules, global
state, and/or less-commonly-understood reasoning principles like coinduction.

*Jingbo Wang,Shashin Halalingaiah,Weiyi Chen,Chao Wang,Isil Dillig*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Praline, an extension to Datalog for handling input correlations in probabilistic logic programming, offering scalable and accurate probability inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous logic programming languages like ProbLog fail to account for statistical correlations among input facts, limiting precision in probabilistic inference.

Method: The paper formulates inference as a constrained optimization problem and introduces a $
\delta$-exact inference algorithm using constraint solving, static analysis, and iterative refinement.

Result: Praline is empirically validated using real-world benchmarks, showing scalability and the ability to provide tight probability bounds.

Conclusion: Praline advances probabilistic logic programming by efficiently handling input correlations, improving both precision and scalability in probabilistic inference tasks.

Abstract: Probabilistic extensions of logic programming languages, such as ProbLog,
integrate logical reasoning with probabilistic inference to evaluate
probabilities of output relations; however, prior work does not account for
potential statistical correlations among input facts. This paper introduces
Praline, a new extension to Datalog designed for precise probabilistic
inference in the presence of (partially known) input correlations. We formulate
the inference task as a constrained optimization problem, where the solution
yields sound and precise probability bounds for output facts. However, due to
the complexity of the resulting optimization problem, this approach alone often
does not scale to large programs. To address scalability, we propose a more
efficient $\delta$-exact inference algorithm that leverages constraint solving,
static analysis, and iterative refinement. Our empirical evaluation on
challenging real-world benchmarks, including side-channel analysis,
demonstrates that our method not only scales effectively but also delivers
tight probability bounds.

*Patrick Redmond,Jonathan Castello,José Manuel Calderón Trilla,Lindsey Kuper*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Core ECS to rigorously define and understand the Entity-Component-System (ECS) software design pattern and explores deterministic-by-construction concurrency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ECS pattern is widely used in game development for its advantages but remains poorly understood and underexplored in other domains, with explanations often tied to specific frameworks or vague metaphors.

Method: The authors propose Core ECS, a formal model that abstracts ECS design principles and identifies deterministic concurrency properties for potential exploitation by ECS frameworks.

Result: Core ECS programs are shown to support deterministic behavior regardless of scheduling, while real-world ECS frameworks are found to underutilize deterministic concurrency opportunities.

Conclusion: A formal understanding of the ECS pattern opens doors to better implementation techniques and demonstrates the potential for deterministic-by-construction concurrent programming models.

Abstract: The Entity-Component-System (ECS) software design pattern, long used in game
development, encourages a clean separation of identity (entities), data
properties (components), and computational behaviors (systems). Programs
written using the ECS pattern are naturally concurrent, and the pattern offers
modularity, flexibility, and performance benefits that have led to a
proliferation of ECS frameworks. Nevertheless, the ECS pattern is little-known
and not well understood outside of a few domains. Existing explanations of the
ECS pattern tend to be mired in the concrete details of particular ECS
frameworks, or they explain the pattern in terms of imperfect metaphors or in
terms of what it is not. We seek a rigorous understanding of the ECS pattern
via the design of a formal model, Core ECS, that abstracts away the details of
specific implementations to reveal the essence of software using the ECS
pattern. We identify a class of Core ECS programs that behave deterministically
regardless of scheduling, enabling use of the ECS pattern as a
deterministic-by-construction concurrent programming model. With Core ECS as a
point of comparison, we then survey several real-world ECS frameworks and find
that they all leave opportunities for deterministic concurrency unexploited.
Our findings point out a space for new ECS implementation techniques that
better leverage such opportunities.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a resource-aware calculus for active object systems ensuring fair termination through a specialized type system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for concurrent resource-aware formalizations in modeling distributed systems and workflows.

Method: Combining graded semantics and type system techniques for sequential programs with fair termination methods from synchronous sessions.

Result: A core calculus and type system guaranteeing fairly terminating resource-aware active object programs.

Conclusion: The approach successfully ensures fair termination in distributed computations via a novel combination of existing techniques.

Abstract: Active object systems are a model of distributed computation that has been
adopted for modelling distributed systems and business process workflows. This
field of modelling is, in essence, concurrent and resource-aware, motivating
the development of resource-aware formalisations on the active object model.
The contributions of this work are the development of a core calculus for
resource-aware active objects together with a type system ensuring that
well-typed programs are fairly terminating, i.e., they can always eventually
terminate. To achieve this, we combine techniques from graded semantics and
type systems, which are quite well understood for sequential programs, with
those for fair termination, which have been developed for synchronous~sessions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a robust formal foundation for CSE platforms that can adapt to different memory models, inspired by the versatility of the Gillian platform.

Method: The foundation is mechanized in Rocq, validated by instantiating to various memory models, covers both SL and ISL analyses, and adheres to standard definitions for interoperation.

Result: The new foundational framework advances prior work by enabling the flexible and formalized support of multiple memory models and analysis types.

Conclusion: This contribution enhances the field of compositional symbolic execution by improving flexibility, interoperability, and theory-driven validation of tools leveraging separation logic.

Abstract: Multiple successful compositional symbolic execution (CSE) tools and
platforms exploit separation logic (SL) for compositional verification and/or
incorrectness separation logic (ISL) for compositional bug-finding, including
VeriFast, Viper, Gillian, CN, and Infer-Pulse. Previous work on the Gillian
platform, the only CSE platform that is parametric on the memory model, meaning
that it can be instantiated to different memory models, suggests that the
ability to use custom memory models allows for more flexibility in supporting
analysis of a wide range of programming languages, for implementing custom
automation, and for improving performance. However, the literature lacks a
satisfactory formal foundation for memory-model-parametric CSE platforms.
  In this paper, inspired by Gillian, we provide a new formal foundation for
memory-model-parametric CSE platforms. Our foundation advances the state of the
art in four ways. First, we mechanise our foundation (in the interactive
theorem prover Rocq). Second, we validate our foundation by instantiating it to
a broad range of memory models, including models for C and CHERI. Third,
whereas previous memory-model-parametric work has only covered SL analyses, we
cover both SL and ISL analyses. Fourth, our foundation is based on standard
definitions of SL and ISL (including definitions of function specification
validity, to ensure sound interoperation with other tools and platforms also
based on standard definitions).

### [248] [Active Learning for Neurosymbolic Program Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15750)
*Celeste Barnaby,Qiaochu Chen,Ramya Ramalingam,Osbert Bastani,Isil Dillig*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel active learning technique tailored for neurosymbolic program synthesis, addressing challenges from neural component mispredictions. The proposed SmartLabel tool shows significant accuracy and efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current active learning techniques for program synthesis fail in the neurosymbolic setting due to mispredictions by neural components, resulting in unintended programs.

Method: The authors propose a constrained conformal evaluation (CCE) strategy that incorporates user feedback to iteratively improve precision until achieving observational equivalence in the synthesized program.

Result: Experiments with the SmartLabel tool demonstrate a 98% success rate in identifying the ground truth program with an average of under 5 user interactions, outperforming prior techniques that have a 65% success rate.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses neural mispredictions in neurosymbolic synthesis, offering a significant improvement over existing active learning techniques in terms of both effectiveness and user interaction minimization.

Abstract: The goal of active learning for program synthesis is to synthesize the
desired program by asking targeted questions that minimize user interaction.
While prior work has explored active learning in the purely symbolic setting,
such techniques are inadequate for the increasingly popular paradigm of
neurosymbolic program synthesis, where the synthesized program incorporates
neural components. When applied to the neurosymbolic setting, such techniques
can -- and, in practice, do -- return an unintended program due to
mispredictions of neural components. This paper proposes a new active learning
technique that can handle the unique challenges posed by neural network
mispredictions. Our approach is based upon a new evaluation strategy called
constrained conformal evaluation (CCE), which accounts for neural
mispredictions while taking into account user-provided feedback. Our proposed
method iteratively makes CCE more precise until all remaining programs are
guaranteed to be observationally equivalent. We have implemented this method in
a tool called SmartLabel and experimentally evaluated it on three neurosymbolic
domains. Our results demonstrate that SmartLabel identifies the ground truth
program for 98% of the benchmarks, requiring under 5 rounds of user interaction
on average. In contrast, prior techniques for active learning are only able to
converge to the ground truth program for at most 65% of the benchmarks.

### [249] [A Vision-Based Shared-Control Teleoperation Scheme for Controlling the Robotic Arm of a Four-Legged Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14994)
*Murilo Vinicius da Silva,Matheus Hipolito Carvalho,Juliano Negri,Thiago Segreto,Gustavo J. G. Lahr,Ricardo V. Godoy,Marcelo Becker*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a vision-based teleoperation system that uses human arm movements to intuitively control quadruped robots with manipulator arms in hazardous environments. It includes safety mechanisms and real-time control capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing teleoperation methods for quadruped robots are complex, non-intuitive, and carry high cognitive load, increasing collision risks in dynamic or confined workspaces.

Method: The approach utilizes a vision-based pose estimation pipeline with an external camera and a machine learning-based model to map wrist movements into robotic arm commands. A trajectory planner ensures collision-free operation.

Result: The system was successfully validated on a real robot, showing robust performance in safely controlling the robotic arm in real-time.

Conclusion: The proposed teleoperation system offers an intuitive, safe, and cost-effective solution for controlling quadruped robots in industrial high-risk applications, significantly improving accessibility and usability over traditional methods.

Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks
demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with
manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.
However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of
integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic
arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.
Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high
level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load
on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that
directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler
and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by
leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external
camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist
position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to
control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe
teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and
the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot,
demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation
approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where
safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and
intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.

### [250] [GraspQP: Differentiable Optimization of Force Closure for Diverse and Robust Dexterous Grasping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15002)
*René Zurbrügg,Andrei Cramariuc,Marco Hutter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method to synthesize large-scale, diverse, and physically feasible grasps for robotic dexterous hands using a differentiable energy-based force closure formulation encapsulated in a Quadratic Program (QP) and MALA* optimization. The result is improved grasp diversity and stability in predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic dexterous hands require diverse and high-quality grasp data to exploit their capabilities fully. Existing methods to generate this data often lack diversity and converge on simple power grasps. The study aims to address this limitation.

Method: The authors propose a differentiable energy formulation of force closure using Quadratic Programs (QP). An adjusted optimization method, MALA*, rejects gradient steps based on energy value distributions for diversity and performance.

Result: Significant improvements in grasp diversity and stability of predictions were achieved. A large dataset of grasps for 5,700 objects, five grippers, and three grasp types, called DexGraspNet, was also provided.

Conclusion: The proposed method expands the versatility of robotic dexterous hands by enabling the generation of diverse and physically feasible grasps. This advancement supports better manipulation policies and task planning, enriching robotic interactions.

Abstract: Dexterous robotic hands enable versatile interactions due to the flexibility
and adaptability of multi-fingered designs, allowing for a wide range of
task-specific grasp configurations in diverse environments. However, to fully
exploit the capabilities of dexterous hands, access to diverse and high-quality
grasp data is essential -- whether for developing grasp prediction models from
point clouds, training manipulation policies, or supporting high-level task
planning with broader action options. Existing approaches for dataset
generation typically rely on sampling-based algorithms or simplified
force-closure analysis, which tend to converge to power grasps and often
exhibit limited diversity. In this work, we propose a method to synthesize
large-scale, diverse, and physically feasible grasps that extend beyond simple
power grasps to include refined manipulations, such as pinches and tri-finger
precision grasps. We introduce a rigorous, differentiable energy formulation of
force closure, implicitly defined through a Quadratic Program (QP).
Additionally, we present an adjusted optimization method (MALA*) that improves
performance by dynamically rejecting gradient steps based on the distribution
of energy values across all samples. We extensively evaluate our approach and
demonstrate significant improvements in both grasp diversity and the stability
of final grasp predictions. Finally, we provide a new, large-scale grasp
dataset for 5,700 objects from DexGraspNet, comprising five different grippers
and three distinct grasp types.

TL;DR: This paper explores using in-context learning in Large Language Models (LLMs) for dynamic manipulation tasks, showcasing improvements in performance over alternative methods, especially in scenarios with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to leverage the reasoning abilities and few-shot prediction capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to address challenges in dynamic manipulation, such as high dimensionality, complex dynamics, and partial observability.

Method: The authors employ an iterative approach where adjustments to a parametric policy are predicted based on previous interactions. This method utilizes in-context learning to adapt LLMs for dynamic manipulation tasks.

Result: Experimental outcomes demonstrate that in-context learning-based approaches outperform alternative methodologies across several tasks in simulation and on physical robots, particularly in low-data environments.

Conclusion: Leveraging the reasoning and generalization capabilities of LLMs through in-context learning can significantly improve dynamic manipulation tasks, establishing this technique as a promising alternative in the domain.

Abstract: Attention-based architectures trained on internet-scale language data have
demonstrated state of the art reasoning ability for various language-based
tasks, such as logic problems and textual reasoning. Additionally, these Large
Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited the ability to perform few-shot
prediction via in-context learning, in which input-output examples provided in
the prompt are generalized to new inputs. This ability furthermore extends
beyond standard language tasks, enabling few-shot learning for general
patterns. In this work, we consider the application of in-context learning with
pre-trained language models for dynamic manipulation. Dynamic manipulation
introduces several crucial challenges, including increased dimensionality,
complex dynamics, and partial observability. To address this, we take an
iterative approach, and formulate our in-context learning problem to predict
adjustments to a parametric policy based on previous interactions. We show
across several tasks in simulation and on a physical robot that utilizing
in-context learning outperforms alternative methods in the low data regime.

Motivation: Wildlife monitoring demands scalable and efficient tools to track individual animals for behavioral analysis and safety interventions, beyond manual solutions or herd-focused approaches.

Method: Developed algorithms for decentralized operation and single RGB camera tracking were integrated into quadrotor drones, enabling field deployment without centralized control or high-bandwidth communication.

Result: Experiments in real-world settings showed reliable individual tracking and coordination of drones in dynamic, natural environments.

Conclusion: This system addresses scalability, autonomy, and robustness in wildlife monitoring, offering a practical tool for field biologists with minimal setup and effective operation.

Abstract: Wildlife field operations demand efficient parallel deployment methods to
identify and interact with specific individuals, enabling simultaneous
collective behavioral analysis, and health and safety interventions. Previous
robotics solutions approach the problem from the herd perspective, or are
manually operated and limited in scale. We propose a decentralized vision-based

identification and tracking of large species in their natural habitat. We
develop novel vision-based coordination and tracking algorithms designed for

communication or control. We validate our system through real-world
experiments, demonstrating reliable deployment in diverse field conditions.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a bio-inspired General-to-Particular (G2P) learning algorithm, enabling a tendon-driven quadruped robot to adapt and learn cyclical movements in minutes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the challenge of enabling robots to quickly learn and adapt their movements, similar to mammals, despite limited knowledge of their body structure and environmental changes.

Method: The method involves an initial general motor babbling phase (five minutes) for the robot, followed by a refinement process of 15 trials (20 seconds each). This sequence mimics biological exploration-exploitation paradigms.

Result: The robot successfully learned to execute functional and adaptive non-convex cyclical movements within a short timespan, demonstrating the algorithm's efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: This proof-of-concept demonstrates the potential of G2P for advancing autonomous robotic locomotion with adaptability to dynamic environments.

Abstract: Like mammals, robots must rapidly learn to control their bodies and interact
with their environment despite incomplete knowledge of their body structure and
surroundings. They must also adapt to continuous changes in both. This work
presents a bio-inspired learning algorithm, General-to-Particular (G2P),
applied to a tendon-driven quadruped robotic system developed and fabricated
in-house. Our quadruped robot undergoes an initial five-minute phase of
generalized motor babbling, followed by 15 refinement trials (each lasting 20
seconds) to achieve specific cyclical movements. This process mirrors the
exploration-exploitation paradigm observed in mammals. With each refinement,
the robot progressively improves upon its initial "good enough" solution. Our
results serve as a proof-of-concept, demonstrating the hardware-in-the-loop
system's ability to learn the control of a tendon-driven quadruped with
redundancies in just a few minutes to achieve functional and adaptive cyclical
non-convex movements. By advancing autonomous control in robotic locomotion,
our approach paves the way for robots capable of dynamically adjusting to new
environments, ensuring sustained adaptability and performance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Mag-Match is a method for registering 3D magnetic field maps using invariant feature descriptors based on higher-order derivatives, without gravity-aligned mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional map-matching methods using cameras or LiDARs falter in challenging environments with obscurants like smoke or dust, prompting exploration of magnetometers, which offer robustness and unique capabilities.

Method: The approach involves extracting and describing features using higher-order derivatives of magnetic field maps. A physics-informed Gaussian Process infers these derivatives efficiently based on point-wise magnetometer data.

Result: Mag-Match successfully performs accurate map-to-map, robot-to-map, and robot-to-robot transformations in both simulated and real-world experiments, outperforming a SIFT-based approach, even without gravitational alignment.

Conclusion: Mag-Match effectively registers magnetic field maps under challenging conditions, showcasing its potential for robust robotic localization and multi-session integration.

Abstract: Map matching and registration are essential tasks in robotics for
localisation and integration of multi-session or multi-robot data. Traditional
methods rely on cameras or LiDARs to capture visual or geometric information
but struggle in challenging conditions like smoke or dust. Magnetometers, on
the other hand, detect magnetic fields, revealing features invisible to other
sensors and remaining robust in such environments. In this paper, we introduce
Mag-Match, a novel method for extracting and describing features in 3D magnetic
vector field maps to register different maps of the same area. Our feature
descriptor, based on higher-order derivatives of magnetic field maps, is
invariant to global orientation, eliminating the need for gravity-aligned
mapping. To obtain these higher-order derivatives map-wide given point-wise
magnetometer data, we leverage a physics-informed Gaussian Process to perform
efficient and recursive probabilistic inference of both the magnetic field and
its derivatives. We evaluate Mag-Match in simulated and real-world experiments
against a SIFT-based approach, demonstrating accurate map-to-map, robot-to-map,
and robot-to-robot transformations - even without initial gravitational
alignment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses labor shortages, safety concerns, and inefficiencies in manual pallet handling in outdoor settings with inconsistent conditions.

Method: The framework uses Florence-2 and SAM-2 for language-grounded segmentation, FoundationPose for pose estimation, and integrates these into a motion planning module for autonomous forklift operations.

Result: Lang2Lift achieves 0.76 mIoU pallet segmentation accuracy and demonstrates robustness in timing and error handling during validation on the ADAPT forklift platform.

Conclusion: Lang2Lift has proven to be feasible for deployment in logistics and construction, providing a robust solution for automated pallet handling in challenging environments.

Abstract: The logistics and construction industries face persistent challenges in
automating pallet handling, especially in outdoor environments with variable
payloads, inconsistencies in pallet quality and dimensions, and unstructured
surroundings. In this paper, we tackle automation of a critical step in pallet
transport: the pallet pick-up operation. Our work is motivated by labor
shortages, safety concerns, and inefficiencies in manually locating and
retrieving pallets under such conditions. We present Lang2Lift, a framework
that leverages foundation models for natural language-guided pallet detection
and 6D pose estimation, enabling operators to specify targets through intuitive
commands such as "pick up the steel beam pallet near the crane." The perception
pipeline integrates Florence-2 and SAM-2 for language-grounded segmentation
with FoundationPose for robust pose estimation in cluttered, multi-pallet
outdoor scenes under variable lighting. The resulting poses feed into a motion
planning module for fully autonomous forklift operation. We validate Lang2Lift
on the ADAPT autonomous forklift platform, achieving 0.76 mIoU pallet
segmentation accuracy on a real-world test dataset. Timing and error analysis
demonstrate the system's robustness and confirm its feasibility for deployment

Conclusion: The integration of reasoning intelligence from Large Language Models and physical drone constraints enables adaptive and efficient task planning for industrial applications.

Abstract: We introduce SRDrone, a novel system designed for self-refinement task

technical contributions: First, it employs a continuous state evaluation
methodology to robustly and accurately determine task outcomes and provide
explanatory feedback. This approach supersedes conventional reliance on
single-frame final-state assessment for continuous, dynamic drone operations.
Second, SRDrone implements a hierarchical Behavior Tree (BT) modification

TL;DR: Kitchen-R is a new benchmark designed to evaluate both task planning and low-level robotic control within a simulated kitchen environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks in robotics and embodied AI either focus solely on high-level instructions or low-level control, lacking a unified approach to assess integrated systems.

Method: Using Isaac Sim simulator, Kitchen-R includes a digital twin environment with over 500 complex language instructions for a mobile manipulator robot, baseline methods including vision-language models and diffusion policy, along with flexible evaluation modes.

Result: Kitchen-R enables a more comprehensive evaluation framework with independent and integrated modes for both planning modules and control policies.

Conclusion: Kitchen-R fills the gap in embodied AI research to offer holistic benchmarking for language-guided robotic systems, promoting advancements in integrated task planning and execution.

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for evaluating progress in robotics and embodied AI.
However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level
language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution,
and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands.
This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where
both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we
propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task
planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as
a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500
complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot.
We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning
strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based
on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our
benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent
assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control
policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R
bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic
benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Pause-Induced Perturbations (PIP) to mitigate policy idling in dexterous manipulation, improving task performance and policy robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of policy idling in dexterous robot manipulation, where policies fail to progress due to inherent shortcomings in the training data.

Method: Proposed a perturbation-based technique (PIP) that detects idling states in robots and applies perturbations to escape problematic states, enhancing exploration.

Result: Achieved noticeable improvements in test-time performance for dual-arm tasks in simulations and a 15-35% success rate improvement on a real-world insertion task.

Conclusion: PIP is an effective strategy to reduce policy idling, resulting in better policy performance and iterative improvement without additional supervision or training.

Abstract: Learning-based methods for dexterous manipulation have made notable progress
in recent years. However, learned policies often still lack reliability and
exhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure
pattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.
they cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain
states. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For
instance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the
robot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an
object or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon
e.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.
However, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other
ways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of
idling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,
Pause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling
states, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range
of challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can
already noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional
supervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical
points in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes
leads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches. Our
perturbation strategy also leads to a 15-35% improvement in absolute success
rate on a real-world insertion task that requires complex multi-finger
manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a trajectory optimization algorithm for free-floating space manipulator systems, leveraging dynamic coupling for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how dynamic coupling between the manipulator arms and the base could be leveraged in trajectory planning, rather than minimized as in most prior studies.

Method: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the dynamic coupling matrix is used to identify dominant coupling behaviors. A quantitative metric is developed to characterize coupling and incorporated into a trajectory optimization framework, supported by a sliding mode control-based tracking controller.

Result: Simulation results show that accounting for dynamic coupling during trajectory planning enables more informed and efficient operation of free-floating space manipulator systems.

Conclusion: Dynamic coupling can be leveraged rather than minimized for trajectory planning in space manipulators, presenting new opportunities for efficient control strategies.

Abstract: This study proposes a dynamic coupling-informed trajectory optimization
algorithm for free-floating space manipulator systems (SMSs). Dynamic coupling
between the base and the manipulator arms plays a critical role in influencing
the system's behavior. While prior research has predominantly focused on
minimizing this coupling, often overlooking its potential advantages, this work
investigates how dynamic coupling can instead be leveraged to improve
trajectory planning. Singular value decomposition (SVD) of the dynamic coupling
matrix is employed to identify the dominant components governing coupling
behavior. A quantitative metric is then formulated to characterize the strength
and directionality of the coupling and is incorporated into a trajectory
optimization framework. To assess the feasibility of the optimized trajectory,
a sliding mode control-based tracking controller is designed to generate the
required joint torque inputs. Simulation results demonstrate that explicitly
accounting for dynamic coupling in trajectory planning enables more informed
and potentially more efficient operation, offering new directions for the
control of free-floating SMSs.

Method: The authors introduce NeRD, a robot-specific dynamics model that predicts future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact constraints. It uses a robot-centric, spatially-invariant simulation state representation and integrates as a backend for a robotics simulator.

Result: NeRD demonstrates stability and accuracy over long simulations, generalizes across various tasks and environments, allows policy learning in a neural-only engine, and can adapt to real-world data to reduce the sim-to-real gap.

Conclusion: NeRD offers a robust and adaptable solution for robot simulation by replacing traditional dynamics solvers with neural models, showing promise for generalization, stability, and real-world adaptability.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of modern robots remains challenging due to
their high degrees of freedom and intricate mechanisms. Neural simulators have
emerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators,
capable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world
data; however, existing neural simulators typically require
application-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or
environments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state.
In this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural
simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We
propose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models
for predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact
constraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers
in an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant
simulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an
interchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We
conduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and
accurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and
environment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural
engine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from
real-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.

### [263] [On the need to perform comprehensive evaluations of automated program repair benchmarks: Sorald case study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15135)
*Sumudu Liyanage,Sherlock A. Licorish,Markus Wagner,Stephen G. MacDonell*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Sorald, an automated program repair (APR) tool, revealing that while it fixes certain coding violations, it also introduces significant new faults, functional issues, and structural degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive evaluation frameworks that consider both the benefits and side effects of automated program repair (APR) tools.

Method: The study assesses Sorald, a state-of-the-art APR tool, using 3,529 SonarQube violations from 2,393 Java code snippets, examining its effectiveness in solving issues and identifying associated side effects.

Result: Sorald successfully fixed some rule violations but introduced 2,120 new faults, including 32 bugs, 2,088 code smells, a 24% unit test failure rate, and structural degradation in code.

Conclusion: Current evaluation methods are insufficient; comprehensive frameworks that account for both improvements and negative impacts of APR tools are critical for their reliable adoption.

Abstract: In supporting the development of high-quality software, especially necessary
in the era of LLMs, automated program repair (APR) tools aim to improve code
quality by automatically addressing violations detected by static analysis
profilers. Previous research tends to evaluate APR tools only for their ability
to clear violations, neglecting their potential introduction of new (sometimes
severe) violations, changes to code functionality and degrading of code
structure. There is thus a need for research to develop and assess
comprehensive evaluation frameworks for APR tools. This study addresses this
research gap, and evaluates Sorald (a state-of-the-art APR tool) as a proof of
concept. Sorald's effectiveness was evaluated in repairing 3,529 SonarQube
violations across 30 rules within 2,393 Java code snippets extracted from Stack
Overflow. Outcomes show that while Sorald fixes specific rule violations, it
introduced 2,120 new faults (32 bugs, 2088 code smells), reduced code
functional correctness--as evidenced by a 24% unit test failure rate--and
degraded code structure, demonstrating the utility of our framework. Findings
emphasize the need for evaluation methodologies that capture the full spectrum
of APR tool effects, including side effects, to ensure their safe and effective
adoption.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a GenAI-native system design framework to address GenAI's inefficiencies and unpredictabilities, integrating AI and software engineering principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges of inefficiency and unpredictability in Generative AI and push the development of reliable, adaptive, and efficient AI-powered systems.

Method: Introducing design principles and architectural patterns (like GenAI-native cells, organic substrates, programmable routers) and explaining software stack composition.

Result: Outlined the conceptual framework and provided insights into the technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives of GenAI-native systems.

Conclusion: The work advocates a shift to GenAI-native systems to inspire further research and practical implementations of robust GenAI-driven designs.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology,
demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse application domains.
However, GenAI faces several major challenges in developing reliable and
efficient GenAI-empowered systems due to its unpredictability and inefficiency.
This paper advocates for a paradigm shift: future GenAI-native systems should
integrate GenAI's cognitive capabilities with traditional software engineering
principles to create robust, adaptive, and efficient systems.
  We introduce foundational GenAI-native design principles centered around five
key pillars -- reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and
assurance -- and propose architectural patterns such as GenAI-native cells,
organic substrates, and programmable routers to guide the creation of resilient
and self-evolving systems. Additionally, we outline the key ingredients of a
GenAI-native software stack and discuss the impact of these systems from
technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives, underscoring the
need for further validation and experimentation. Our work aims to inspire
future research and encourage relevant communities to implement and refine this
conceptual framework.

### [265] [An Empirical Study of Knowledge Distillation for Code Understanding Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15423)
*Ruiqi Wang,Zezhou Yang,Cuiyun Gao,Xin Xia,Qing Liao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores the effectiveness of knowledge distillation (KD) in pre-trained language models (PLMs) for code understanding, highlighting consistent performance boosts in student models, with the latest feature-based KD methods achieving up to 98% of teacher model performance with just 5% of parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While knowledge distillation has shown success in NLP and computer vision, its application in code understanding remains unexplored. This paper aims to investigate KD's effectiveness for addressing computational challenges in PLMs used in code understanding tasks.

Method: The authors systematically evaluate logit-based and feature-based KD methods with eight student models and two teacher PLMs across three downstream code understanding tasks, analyzing performance, efficiency, and architecture interactions.

Result: KD consistently boosts student model performance compared to standard fine-tuning. Feature-based KD achieves top results, with student models retaining up to 98% teacher performance using minimal parameters. Code-specific PLMs serve as more effective teacher models.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation improves code model efficiency and performance effectively, with remarkable results from feature-based KD. The study also challenges assumptions regarding student-teacher architectural similarity and offers insights for future research directions.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for code
understanding. However, deploying these PLMs in large-scale applications faces
practical challenges due to their computational intensity and inference
latency. Knowledge distillation (KD), a promising model compression and
acceleration technique, addresses these limitations by transferring knowledge
from large teacher models to compact student models, enabling efficient
inference while preserving most of the teacher models' capabilities. While this
technique has shown remarkable success in natural language processing and
computer vision domains, its potential for code understanding tasks remains
largely underexplored.
  In this paper, we systematically investigate the effectiveness and usage of
KD in code understanding tasks. Our study encompasses two popular types of KD
methods, i.e., logit-based and feature-based KD methods, experimenting across
eight student models and two teacher PLMs from different domains on three
downstream tasks. The experimental results indicate that KD consistently offers
notable performance boosts across student models with different sizes compared
with standard fine-tuning. Notably, code-specific PLM demonstrates better
effectiveness as the teacher model. Among all KD methods, the latest
feature-based KD methods exhibit superior performance, enabling student models
to retain up to 98% teacher performance with merely 5% parameters. Regarding
student architecture, our experiments reveal that similarity with teacher
architecture does not necessarily lead to better performance. We further
discuss the efficiency and behaviors in the KD process and inference, summarize
the implications of findings, and identify promising future directions.

*Dongjun Yu,Xiao Yan,Zhenrui Li,Jipeng Xiao,Haochuan He,Yongda Yu,Hao Zhang,Guoping Rong,Xiaobo Huang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SynthCoder, a model aimed at state-of-the-art performance in code completion, overcoming common limitations seen with current optimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code completion models often face performance trade-offs across datasets and metrics, with some exceeding and others falling below baseline performance.

Method: SynthCoder integrates diverse dataset construction using AST and heuristics, enriches training corpus with BM25 and call graphs, and employs a two-stage training with Curriculum Learning and Direct Preference Optimization.

Result: SynthCoder achieves high performance on repository-level code completion benchmarks (aiXcoder, ExecRepoBench, CrossCodeEval, CoLT) while reducing repetitive code generation issues.

Conclusion: SynthCoder effectively blends industry practices with innovative methods to advance code completion performance across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Code completion is a prominent application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
software engineering. Due to the near real-time response requirements of this
task, base models with small to medium-sized parameters are typically employed,
supplemented by various optimization and post-training techniques. However,
these optimization methods often have trade-offs, leading to a seesaw effect
where performance improvements on certain datasets or metrics are accompanied
by degradations on others -- sometimes even falling below the baseline model's
performance. This paper proposes SynthCoder, a model that integrates leading
industry practices to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion task. In specific, we first construct
a diverse dataset by combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node extraction with
heuristics that simulate developer behavior. Then we enrich our training corpus
with cross-file contextual information using the BM25 algorithm and call
graphs, enhancing the model's ability to perform code completion in both
file-level and repository-level scenarios. As the last step, we employ a
two-stage training process using the Seed-Coder-8B-Base as the base model.
First, we fine-tune the model using Curriculum Learning technology. Following
this, we perform alignment using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
preference pairs generated through Rejection Sampling. Experimental results
demonstrate that our final model excels on mainstream repository-level code
completion benchmarks, including aiXcoder, ExecRepoBench, CrossCodeEval, and
CoLT. Furthermore, our carefully curated training set effectively mitigates the
model's tendency to just repeat existing code, a common issue existing in
various code completion models.

*Elena Masserini,Diego Clerissi,Daniela Micucci,João R. Campos,Leonardo Mariani*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces two datasets, TOFU-R and BRASATO, to support research on task-based chatbot reliability and provide tools for dataset creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating chatbot reliability and robustness is difficult due to the lack of high-quality, large-scale datasets and dependence on outdated or limited examples.

Method: Developed two datasets—TOFU-R, capturing Rasa chatbots on GitHub, and BRASATO, a curated set of functionally complex chatbots—to aid evaluation and reproducibility.

Result: The provided datasets represent open-source chatbot practices and ease reproducibility for future research on chatbot reliability and testing.

Conclusion: TOFU-R and BRASATO contribute to advancing the research of task-based chatbot assessment by offering meaningful datasets and tool support, enabling robust evaluations.

Abstract: Task-based chatbots are increasingly being used to deliver real services, yet
assessing their reliability, security, and robustness remains underexplored,
also due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets. The emerging
automated quality assessment techniques targeting chatbots often rely on
limited pools of subjects, such as custom-made toy examples, or outdated, no
longer available, or scarcely popular agents, complicating the evaluation of
such techniques. In this paper, we present two datasets and the tool support
necessary to create and maintain these datasets. The first dataset is RASA
TASK-BASED CHATBOTS FROM GITHUB (TOFU-R), which is a snapshot of the Rasa
chatbots available on GitHub, representing the state of the practice in
open-source chatbot development with Rasa. The second dataset is BOT RASA
COLLECTION (BRASATO), a curated selection of the most relevant chatbots for
dialogue complexity, functional complexity, and utility, whose goal is to ease
reproducibility and facilitate research on chatbot reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in reproducing and replicating studies involving LLMs due to their non-determinism, opaque training data, and evolving architectures.

Method: The authors propose a taxonomy of study types and a set of eight guidelines that include essential and desired criteria targeting transparency during research involving LLMs.

Result: The paper introduces comprehensive recommendations for declaring LLM usage, documenting configurations, validating through human involvement, using open models as baselines, and disclosing limitations.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes improving open science practices in LLM-based research by enabling transparency and reproducibility through clearly defined guidelines and taxonomy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into software
engineering (SE) research and practice, yet their non-determinism, opaque
training data, and evolving architectures complicate the reproduction and
replication of empirical studies. We present a community effort to scope this
space, introducing a taxonomy of LLM-based study types together with eight
guidelines for designing and reporting empirical studies involving LLMs. The
guidelines present essential (must) criteria as well as desired (should)
criteria and target transparency throughout the research process. Our
recommendations, contextualized by our study types, are: (1) to declare LLM
usage and role; (2) to report model versions, configurations, and fine-tuning;
(3) to document tool architectures; (4) to disclose prompts and interaction
logs; (5) to use human validation; (6) to employ an open LLM as a baseline; (7)
to report suitable baselines, benchmarks, and metrics; and (8) to openly
articulate limitations and mitigations. Our goal is to enable reproducibility
and replicability despite LLM-specific barriers to open science. We maintain
the study types and guidelines online as a living resource for the community to
use and shape (llm-guidelines.org).

*Markus Borg,Martin Larsson,Philip Breid,Nadim Hagatulah*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes improving maintainability in software engineering through targeted requirements practices and introduces QUPER-MAn to achieve explicit maintainability goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintainability in software projects is often undervalued despite its significant role in sustainable development.

Method: An exploratory study on maintainability requirements practices and the design of QUPER-MAn, an adaptation of the QUPER model incorporating benchmarks and target settings.

Result: The study reveals maintainability is frequently treated as a secondary concern with implicit references, leading to a proposed tool QUPER-MAn for structured improvements.

Conclusion: QUPER-MAn offers a pathway for software organizations to actively prioritize and manage maintainability as a key requirement through informed decision-making.

Abstract: Maintainable source code is essential for sustainable development in any
software organization. Unfortunately, many studies show that maintainability
often receives less attention than its importance warrants. We argue that
requirements engineering can address this gap the problem by fostering
discussions and setting appropriate targets in a responsible manner. In this
preliminary work, we conducted an exploratory study of industry practices
related to requirements engineering for maintainability. Our findings confirm
previous studies: maintainability remains a second-class quality concern.
Explicit requirements often make sweeping references to coding conventions.
Tools providing maintainability proxies are common but typically only used in
implicit requirements related to engineering practices. To address this, we
propose QUPER-MAn, a maintainability adaption of the QUPER model, which was
originally developed to help organizations set targets for performance
requirements. Developed using a design science approach, QUPER-MAn, integrates
maintainability benchmarks and supports target setting. We posit that it can
shift maintainability from an overlooked development consequence to an actively
managed goal driven by informed and responsible engineering decisions.

### [270] [A Novel Mutation Based Method for Detecting FPGA Logic Synthesis Tool Bugs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15536)
*Yi Zhang,He Jiang,Xiaochen Li,Shikai Guo,Peiyu Zou,Zun Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes VERMEI, a method for testing FPGA logic synthesis tools, to identify bugs through preprocessing, equivalent mutation, and differential testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Defects in FPGA logic synthesis tools can lead to security risks and unexpected behaviors, making effective testing crucial.

Method: VERMEI combines preprocessing for inactive code detection, equivalent mutation using Bayesian sampling to create complex test programs, and bug identification through differential testing.

Result: Experiments on tools such as Yosys, Vivado, and Quartus showed VERMEI surpassed existing methods, revealing 15 bugs in five months, with 9 confirmed as new.

Conclusion: VERMEI is an effective approach to enhance the robustness of FPGA logic synthesis tools by identifying previously undetected defects.

Abstract: FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) logic synthesis tools are key components
in the EDA (Electronic Design Automation) toolchain. They convert hardware
designs written in description languages such as Verilog into gate-level
representations for FPGAs. However, defects in these tools may lead to
unexpected behaviors and pose security risks. Therefore, it is crucial to
harden these tools through testing. Although several methods have been proposed
to automatically test FPGA logic synthesis tools, the challenge remains of
insufficient semantic and logical complexity in test programs. In this paper,
we propose VERMEI, a new method for testing FPGA logic synthesis tools. VERMEI
consists of three modules: preprocessing, equivalent mutation, and bug
identification. The preprocessing module identifies zombie logic (inactive code
with no impact on the circuit output) in seed programs through simulation and
coverage analysis. The equivalent mutation module generates equivalent variants
of seed programs by pruning or inserting logic fragments in zombie areas. It
uses Bayesian sampling to extract logic fragments from historical Verilog
designs, making the generated variants have complex control flows and
structures. The bug identification module, based on differential testing,
compares the synthesized outputs of seed and variant programs to identify bugs.
Experiments on Yosys, Vivado, and Quartus demonstrate that VERMEI outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods. Within five months, VERMEI reported 15 bugs to
vendors, 9 of which were confirmed as new.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper implements a workshop-driven approach for technical debt management (TDM) in a software company, leading to better awareness and sustainable processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how to establish an effective TDM process in IT companies and foster long-term TD awareness while examining the practicality of research-backed techniques.

Method: The researchers used action research over 16 months, incorporating workshops, decision-making measures, and backlog analysis while working with an IT signal processing team.

Result: Practitioners prioritized addressing low-effort, high-impact TD items, and reminders integrated into workflows significantly improved TD awareness over the long term.

Conclusion: The workshop-based TDM approach is effective and sustainable, and it generated innovative techniques for broader applicability in managing technical debt.

Abstract: Context. Technical debt (TD) items are constructs in a software system
providing short-term benefits but hindering future changes. TD management (TDM)
is frequently researched but rarely adopted in practice. Goal. This study aimed
to establish a TDM process in an IT company based on a predefined workshop
concept. We analyzed which research approaches practitioners adopted for each
TD activity and the TDM's long-term effect on TD awareness. Method. We used
action research (five action cycles in 16 months) with an IT team that creates
IT solutions for signal processing. To examine TD awareness, we (1) analyzed
questionnaires completed during each workshop, (2) observed team meetings, (3)
adopted a method from psychology for measuring awareness in decision-making
situations called TD-SAGAT, and (4) evaluated the backlog data. Results.
Practitioners preferred TD repayment and prioritization based on the system's
evolution and cost calculations, i.e., repayment of so-called low-hanging
fruits. Reminders in the backlog items, such as checkboxes or text templates,
led to a sustainable rise in TD awareness. Conclusions. We showed that a
workshop-based approach is feasible and leads to sustainable process changes.
New ideas for TDM applicable to other IT teams emerged, e.g., using a
re-submission date, using a Talked about TD checkbox, and using visualizations
for TD prioritization.

*Yijin Ni,Xiaoming Huo*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a kernel-based formulation of the Equalized Odds criterion, denoted as $EO_k$, for fair representation learning, ensuring fairness while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address discrimination in supervised learning concerning sensitive attributes, seeking to balance fairness measures with predictive accuracy in representation learning.

Method: It formulates a kernel-based fairness criterion, $EO_k$, and its empirical counterpart $
EO_k$, with mathematical guarantees for fairness and error bounds through rigorous analytical characterization.

Result: The paper demonstrates that $EO_k$ satisfies fairness objectives like independence and equalized odds under unbiased settings and balances predictive accuracy with fairness criteria under biased conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed kernel-based approach provides a unified framework for analyzing tradeoffs between fairness criteria and lays the foundation for future provably fair algorithms.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel kernel-based formulation of the Equalized Odds
(EO) criterion, denoted as $EO_k$, for fair representation learning (FRL) in
supervised settings. The central goal of FRL is to mitigate discrimination
regarding a sensitive attribute $S$ while preserving prediction accuracy for
the target variable $Y$. Our proposed criterion enables a rigorous and
interpretable quantification of three core fairness objectives: independence
(prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent of $S$), separation (also known as
equalized odds; prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent with $S$ conditioned on
target attribute $Y$), and calibration ($Y$ is independent of $S$ conditioned
on the prediction $\hat{Y}$). Under both unbiased ($Y$ is independent of $S$)
and biased ($Y$ depends on $S$) conditions, we show that $EO_k$ satisfies both
independence and separation in the former, and uniquely preserves predictive
accuracy while lower bounding independence and calibration in the latter,
thereby offering a unified analytical characterization of the tradeoffs among
these fairness criteria. We further define the empirical counterpart,
$\hat{EO}_k$, a kernel-based statistic that can be computed in quadratic time,
with linear-time approximations also available. A concentration inequality for
$\hat{EO}_k$ is derived, providing performance guarantees and error bounds,
which serve as practical certificates of fairness compliance. While our focus
is on theoretical development, the results lay essential groundwork for
principled and provably fair algorithmic design in future empirical studies.

*Björn Volkmann,Jan-Hendrik Ewering,Michael Meindl,Simon F. G. Ehlers,Thomas Seel*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a versatile system identification tool for blending data-driven learning with diverse prior knowledge using Bayesian inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning models for dynamical systems with limited data is challenging, necessitating fusion of prior knowledge like equations and smoothness assumptions with data insights.

Method: The authors propose a framework for online and offline Bayesian inference and learning, combining known dynamics with approximations for unknown system parts and deriving efficient parameter marginalization without needing custom transformations.

Result: The framework demonstrates its utility across three case studies, including experimental data, highlighting applicability and efficiency.

Conclusion: This general-purpose tool simplifies the integration of data and prior system knowledge, offering a consistent solution for Bayesian inference and learning.

Abstract: Accuracy and generalization capabilities are key objectives when learning
dynamical system models. To obtain such models from limited data, current works
exploit prior knowledge and assumptions about the system. However, the fusion
of diverse prior knowledge, e. g. partially known system equations and
smoothness assumptions about unknown model parts, with information contained in
the data remains a challenging problem, especially in input-output settings
with latent system state. In particular, learning functions that are nested
inside known system equations can be a laborious and error-prone expert task.
This paper considers inference of latent states and learning of unknown model
parts for fusion of data information with different sources of prior knowledge.
The main contribution is a general-purpose system identification tool that, for
the first time, provides a consistent solution for both, online and offline
Bayesian inference and learning while allowing to incorporate explicit and
implicit prior system knowledge. We propose a novel interface for combining
known dynamics functions with a learning-based approximation of unknown system
parts. Based on the proposed model structure, closed-form densities for
efficient parameter marginalization are derived. No user-tailored coordinate
transformations or model inversions are needed, making the presented framework
a general-purpose tool for inference and learning. The broad applicability of
the devised framework is illustrated in three distinct case studies, including
an experimental data set.

*Jingyi Wang,Haowei Wang,Szu Hui Ng,Cosmin G. Petra*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the cumulative regret upper bounds for the Gaussian process expected improvement (GP-EI) algorithm in Bayesian optimization, considering three types of incumbents for the current best value.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the open question regarding the cumulative regret upper bound of the widely used Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function in Bayesian optimization, and to provide theoretical insights into the choice of incumbents under noise.

Method: The authors analyze the GP-EI algorithm under noisy conditions using three incumbents (BPMI, BSPMI, and BOI) and study its cumulative regret for popular kernel choices like squared exponential and Matérn.

Result: The study proves that GP-EI with BPMI and BSPMI is no-regret for SE and Matérn kernels. GP-EI with BOI either achieves sublinear cumulative regret or fast-converging noisy simple regret bounds.

Conclusion: The paper provides the first theoretical results on cumulative regret bounds for GP-EI with different incumbents, offering practitioners guidance on selecting incumbents in noisy Bayesian optimization settings.

Abstract: Expected improvement (EI) is one of the most widely used acquisition
functions in Bayesian optimization (BO). Despite its proven empirical success
in applications, the cumulative regret upper bound of EI remains an open
question. In this paper, we analyze the classic noisy Gaussian process expected
improvement (GP-EI) algorithm. We consider the Bayesian setting, where the
objective is a sample from a GP. Three commonly used incumbents, namely the
best posterior mean incumbent (BPMI), the best sampled posterior mean incumbent
(BSPMI), and the best observation incumbent (BOI) are considered as the choices
of the current best value in GP-EI. We present for the first time the
cumulative regret upper bounds of GP-EI with BPMI and BSPMI. Importantly, we
show that in both cases, GP-EI is a no-regret algorithm for both squared
exponential (SE) and Mat\'ern kernels. Further, we present for the first time
that GP-EI with BOI either achieves a sublinear cumulative regret upper bound
or has a fast converging noisy simple regret bound for SE and Mat\'ern kernels.
Our results provide theoretical guidance to the choice of incumbent when
practitioners apply GP-EI in the noisy setting. Numerical experiments are
conducted to validate our findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately modeling feature interactions in tabular data, a challenge in predictive modeling tasks like insurance pricing, remains critical and requires both high predictive accuracy and interpretability.

Method: PIN is a neural network that explicitly models pairwise feature interactions using a structure inspired by decision trees. It incorporates a shared feed-forward architecture and supports efficient SHAP computations.

Result: PIN demonstrated superior predictive accuracy compared to traditional and modern benchmarks on the French motor insurance dataset. It also provides clear insights into feature interactions and their contribution to predictions.

Conclusion: PIN improves predictive modeling in tabular data while enhancing interpretability, benefiting tasks like insurance pricing by showing feature interaction effects and providing actionable insights.

Abstract: Modeling feature interactions in tabular data remains a key challenge in
predictive modeling, for example, as used for insurance pricing. This paper
proposes the Tree-like Pairwise Interaction Network (PIN), a novel neural
network architecture that explicitly captures pairwise feature interactions
through a shared feed-forward neural network architecture that mimics the
structure of decision trees. PIN enables intrinsic interpretability by design,
allowing for direct inspection of interaction effects. Moreover, it allows for
efficient SHapley's Additive exPlanation (SHAP) computations because it only
involves pairwise interactions. We highlight connections between PIN and
established models such as GA2Ms, gradient boosting machines, and graph neural
networks. Empirical results on the popular French motor insurance dataset show
that PIN outperforms both traditional and modern neural networks benchmarks in
predictive accuracy, while also providing insight into how features interact
with each another and how they contribute to the predictions.

### [277] [Robust Symbolic Reasoning for Visual Narratives via Hierarchical and Semantically Normalized Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14941)
*Yi-Chun Chen*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semantic normalization framework for narrative knowledge graphs to address annotation inconsistencies and redundancy in visual narratives using methods such as lexical similarity and clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing narrative graphs for visual storytelling lack consistency and suffer from redundancy, hindering effective reasoning and generalization.

Method: The authors introduce a framework to normalize hierarchical narrative graphs by consolidating semantically-related actions and events through lexical similarity and embedding-based clustering techniques.

Result: They applied their framework to Manga109 dataset, demonstrating improved coherence and robustness in tasks such as action retrieval, character grounding, and event summarization.

Conclusion: Semantic normalization enhances narrative graph consistency and scalability, advancing multimodal narrative understanding from a cognitively inspired perspective.

Abstract: Understanding visual narratives such as comics requires structured
representations that capture events, characters, and their relations across
multiple levels of story organization. However, symbolic narrative graphs often
suffer from inconsistency and redundancy, where similar actions or events are
labeled differently across annotations or contexts. Such variance limits the
effectiveness of reasoning and generalization.
  This paper introduces a semantic normalization framework for hierarchical
narrative knowledge graphs. Building on cognitively grounded models of
narrative comprehension, we propose methods that consolidate semantically
related actions and events using lexical similarity and embedding-based
clustering. The normalization process reduces annotation noise, aligns symbolic
categories across narrative levels, and preserves interpretability.
  We demonstrate the framework on annotated manga stories from the Manga109
dataset, applying normalization to panel-, event-, and story-level graphs.
Preliminary evaluations across narrative reasoning tasks, such as action
retrieval, character grounding, and event summarization, show that semantic
normalization improves coherence and robustness, while maintaining symbolic
transparency. These findings suggest that normalization is a key step toward
scalable, cognitively inspired graph models for multimodal narrative
understanding.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving the visualization of real-time event video transcode processes using the adder-viz software.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address limitations in flexibility, speed, and compressibility in neuromorphic event video representations.

Method: The authors propose enhancements to adder-viz software, which helps visualize real-time event transcode processes.

Result: The improved adder-viz software provides better support for real-time visualization of neuromorphic event data.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the enhancements provide meaningful progress in visualizing and working with event video data in real-time applications.

Abstract: Recent years have brought about a surge in neuromorphic ``event'' video
research, primarily targeting computer vision applications. Event video eschews
video frames in favor of asynchronous, per-pixel intensity samples. While much
work has focused on a handful of representations for specific event cameras,
these representations have shown limitations in flexibility, speed, and
compressibility. We previously proposed the unified AD{\Delta}ER representation
to address these concerns. This paper introduces numerous improvements to the
\textit{adder-viz} software for visualizing real-time event transcode processes
and applications in-the-loop. The MIT-licensed software is available from a

### [279] [On the Effectiveness of Graph Reordering for Accelerating Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search on GPU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15436)
*Yutaro Oguri,Mai Nishimura,Yusuke Matsui*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper investigates how graph reordering can improve the performance of graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search on GPUs, achieving up to 15% efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of focus on memory layout optimization in graph-based ANNS, despite its significant influence on execution time in modern AI applications.

Method: The study uses a unified evaluation framework with a graph adapter to standardize graph topologies, coupled with a GPU-optimized traversal engine, to assess various reordering strategies and their impacts.

Result: Experiments show that GPU-targeted reordering strategies improve Query Per Second (QPS) by up to 15%, maintaining search accuracy across different datasets and graph indices.

Conclusion: Memory layout optimization offers complementary benefits to algorithmic advancements for graph-based ANNS on GPUs, and the authors encourage further research by releasing their code.

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of graph reordering effects for
graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) on a GPU. While
graph-based ANNS has become the dominant paradigm for modern AI applications,
recent approaches focus on algorithmic innovations while neglecting memory
layout considerations that significantly affect execution time. Our unified
evaluation framework enables comprehensive evaluation of diverse reordering
strategies across different graph indices through a graph adapter that converts
arbitrary graph topologies into a common representation and a GPU-optimized
graph traversal engine. We conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse
datasets and state-of-the-art graph indices, introducing analysis metrics that
quantify the relationship between structural properties and memory layout
effectiveness. Our GPU-targeted reordering achieves up to 15$\%$ QPS
improvements while preserving search accuracy, demonstrating that memory layout
optimization operates orthogonally to existing algorithmic innovations. We will
release all code upon publication to facilitate reproducibility and foster
further research.

### [280] [Privacy Preserving Inference of Personalized Content for Out of Matrix Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14905)
*Michael Sun,Tai Vu,Andrew Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DeepNaniNet is a deep recommendation framework that addresses challenges like cold start and privacy in niche and dynamic communities, delivering significant improvements over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Niche and dynamic communities face challenges such as cold start problems, data sparsity, and privacy concerns, where traditional recommender systems like collaborative filtering are ineffective.

Method: The authors propose DeepNaniNet, which uses an inductive graph-based architecture combining user-item interactions, item relations, and BERT-based textual review embeddings. They also employ a content basket representation and an autoencoder for handling unseen users.

Result: DeepNaniNet achieves improved performance on both CiteULike and AnimeULike benchmarks, significantly outperforming competitors like Weighted Matrix Factorization and DropoutNet, especially in cold and warm start scenarios.

Conclusion: DeepNaniNet demonstrates the ability to provide privacy-preserving, high-quality recommendations in challenging settings with sparse data and cold start users, integrating various content forms effectively.

Abstract: Recommender systems for niche and dynamic communities face persistent
challenges from data sparsity, cold start users and items, and privacy
constraints. Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based approaches
underperform in these settings, either requiring invasive user data or failing
when preference histories are absent. We present DeepNaniNet, a deep neural
recommendation framework that addresses these challenges through an inductive
graph-based architecture combining user-item interactions, item-item relations,
and rich textual review embeddings derived from BERT. Our design enables cold
start recommendations without profile mining, using a novel "content basket"
user representation and an autoencoder-based generalization strategy for unseen
users. We introduce AnimeULike, a new dataset of 10,000 anime titles and 13,000
users, to evaluate performance in realistic scenarios with high proportions of
guest or low-activity users. DeepNaniNet achieves state-of-the-art cold start
results on the CiteULike benchmark, matches DropoutNet in user recall without
performance degradation for out-of-matrix users, and outperforms Weighted
Matrix Factorization (WMF) and DropoutNet on AnimeULike warm start by up to 7x
and 1.5x in Recall@100, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that DeepNaniNet
delivers high-quality, privacy-preserving recommendations in data-sparse, cold
start-heavy environments while effectively integrating heterogeneous content
sources.

### [281] [Collaborative Filtering using Variational Quantum Hopfield Associative Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14906)
*Amir Kermanshahani,Ebrahim Ardeshir-Larijani,Rakesh Saini,Saif Al-Kuwari*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid quantum-classical recommendation system using Quantum Hopfield Associative Memory (QHAM) and deep learning to process and classify data efficiently, achieving robust metrics in both ideal and noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage quantum computing's speed and machine learning techniques for improving recommendation systems on real-world datasets.

Method: The system clusters users using K-Means, converts groups into polar patterns, integrates variational QHAM-based recommendation models, and trains using MSE loss in both ideal and noisy environments with a Qiskit AER noise model.

Result: Achieved ROC values of 0.9795 and 0.9177, accuracies of 0.8841 and 0.8013, and F-1 Scores of 0.8786 and 0.7866 in ideal and noisy environments respectively, while reducing qubit overhead.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework shows promising performance comparable to classical systems, validates robustness in noisy quantum environments, and optimizes QHAM architectures for practical applications.

Abstract: Quantum computing, with its ability to do exponentially faster computation
compared to classical systems, has found novel applications in various fields
such as machine learning and recommendation systems. Quantum Machine Learning
(QML), which integrates quantum computing with machine learning techniques,
presents powerful new tools for data processing and pattern recognition. This
paper proposes a hybrid recommendation system that combines Quantum Hopfield
Associative Memory (QHAM) with deep neural networks to improve the extraction
and classification on the MovieLens 1M dataset. User archetypes are clustered
into multiple unique groups using the K-Means algorithm and converted into
polar patterns through the encoder's activation function. These polar patterns
are then integrated into the variational QHAM-based hybrid recommendation
model. The system was trained using the MSE loss over 35 epochs in an ideal
environment, achieving an ROC value of 0.9795, an accuracy of 0.8841, and an
F-1 Score of 0.8786. Trained with the same number of epochs in a noisy
environment using a custom Qiskit AER noise model incorporating bit-flip and
readout errors with the same probabilities as in real quantum hardware, it
achieves an ROC of 0.9177, an accuracy of 0.8013, and an F-1 Score equal to
0.7866, demonstrating consistent performance.
  Additionally, we were able to optimize the qubit overhead present in previous
QHAM architectures by efficiently updating only one random targeted qubit. This
research presents a novel framework that combines variational quantum computing
with deep learning, capable of dealing with real-world datasets with comparable
performance compared to purely classical counterparts. Additionally, the model
can perform similarly well in noisy configurations, showcasing a steady
performance and proposing a promising direction for future usage in
recommendation systems.

### [282] [Adversarial Attacks against Neural Ranking Models via In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15283)
*Amin Bigdeli,Negar Arabzadeh,Ebrahim Bagheri,Charles L. A. Clarke*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FSAP, a new black-box attack method, uses few-shot prompting with Large Language Models to generate adversarial documents that mislead while maintaining high rankings in neural retrieval systems, presenting a new threat.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the susceptibility of neural ranking models (NRMs) to adversarial manipulation and explore novel black-box attack strategies that do not require traditional token-level perturbations or manual intervention.

Method: FSAP constructs adversarial attacks using few-shot prompting of large language models. It synthesizes harmful yet credible-looking documents based on prior harmful examples and operates in two modes—FSAP-IntraQ (query-specific) and FSAP-InterQ (cross-query generalization).

Result: Experiments confirm that FSAP can consistently create adversarial documents capable of outranking accurate ones across diverse NRMs, demonstrating strong stance alignment, low detectability, and cross-model generalizability.

Conclusion: FSAP highlights significant vulnerabilities in neural ranking systems, indicating the need for improved defenses against adversarial document generation strategies.

Abstract: While neural ranking models (NRMs) have shown high effectiveness, they remain
susceptible to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we introduce Few-Shot
Adversarial Prompting (FSAP), a novel black-box attack framework that leverages
the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
generate high-ranking adversarial documents. Unlike previous approaches that
rely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents,
FSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting,
requiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning
the LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP
synthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly
embed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic
content. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful
examples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which
enables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across
unrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health
Misinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that
FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate
documents. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that these adversarial
outputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability, posing a
realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also
effectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

### [283] [Closing the Performance Gap in Generative Recommenders with Collaborative Tokenization and Efficient Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14910)
*Simon Lepage,Jeremie Mary,David Picard*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper critiques common generative recommender systems, identifies key limitations, and introduces two novel approaches—COSETTE and MARIUS—that enhance item tokenization and modeling efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the shortcomings of generative recommender systems, including inadequate collaborative signals in item tokenization and inefficiencies in common encoder-decoder architectures, which have led these systems to underperform compared to ID-based baselines.

Method: The authors propose COSETTE, a contrastive tokenization method that incorporates collaborative signals into item representations, and MARIUS, a lightweight generative model inspired by audio modeling, which decouples timeline modeling from item decoding for higher efficiency.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that COSETTE and MARIUS improve recommendation accuracy and reduce inference costs. These methods either narrow or eliminate the performance gap with modern ID-based models while retaining the advantages of the generative approach.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that incorporating collaborative signals and optimizing architectures in generative models can successfully bridge the performance gap between generative and traditional recommender systems, marking a step forward in recommending effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Recent work has explored generative recommender systems as an alternative to
traditional ID-based models, reframing item recommendation as a sequence
generation task over discrete item tokens. While promising, such methods often
underperform in practice compared to well-tuned ID-based baselines like SASRec.
In this paper, we identify two key limitations holding back generative
approaches: the lack of collaborative signal in item tokenization, and
inefficiencies in the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture. To address
these issues, we introduce COSETTE, a contrastive tokenization method that
integrates collaborative information directly into the learned item
representations, jointly optimizing for both content reconstruction and
recommendation relevance. Additionally, we propose MARIUS, a lightweight,
audio-inspired generative model that decouples timeline modeling from item
decoding. MARIUS reduces inference cost while improving recommendation
accuracy. Experiments on standard sequential recommendation benchmarks show
that our approach narrows, or even eliminates, the performance gap between
generative and modern ID-based models, while retaining the benefits of the
generative paradigm.

### [284] [Personalized Recommendations via Active Utility-based Pairwise Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14911)
*Bahar Boroomand,James R. Wright*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a model-agnostic framework for recommender systems that utilizes pairwise comparisons instead of traditional rating systems. It aligns recommendations with task-specific utility functions and employs an active sampling strategy based on the Plackett-Luce model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommender systems face challenges due to the subjective interpretation of ratings and the impracticality of eliciting full rankings. The paper aims to address these limitations by designing an intuitive and efficient preference elicitation method using pairwise comparisons.

Method: The authors propose a generalized utility-based framework utilizing pairwise comparisons for learning preferences. They implement this with matrix factorization and neural networks, and introduce an active sampling strategy leveraging the probabilistic Plackett-Luce framework.

Result: Experiments conducted in movie recommendations and university admissions tasks show the framework is more accurate, data-efficient, and user-centric compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed framework fosters a more personalized ranking paradigm by aligning system objectives with task-specific utility measures and using active sampling strategies for preference elicitation.

Abstract: Recommender systems play a critical role in enhancing user experience by
providing personalized suggestions based on user preferences. Traditional
approaches often rely on explicit numerical ratings or assume access to fully
ranked lists of items. However, ratings frequently fail to capture true
preferences due to users' behavioral biases and subjective interpretations of
rating scales, while eliciting full rankings is demanding and impractical. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a generalized utility-based framework
that learns preferences from simple and intuitive pairwise comparisons. Our
approach is model-agnostic and designed to optimize for arbitrary,
task-specific utility functions, allowing the system's objective to be
explicitly aligned with the definition of a high-quality outcome in any given
application. A central contribution of our work is a novel utility-based active
sampling strategy for preference elicitation. This method selects queries that
are expected to provide the greatest improvement to the utility of the final
recommended outcome. We ground our preference model in the probabilistic
Plackett-Luce framework for pairwise data. To demonstrate the versatility of
our approach, we present two distinct experiments: first, an implementation
using matrix factorization for a classic movie recommendation task, and second,
an implementation using a neural network for a complex candidate selection
scenario in university admissions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
framework provides a more accurate, data-efficient, and user-centric paradigm
for personalized ranking.

*Lining Chen,Qingwen Zeng,Huaming Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper proposes M-$LLM^3$REC, a recommendation system using large language models to account for user motivations and improve performance in challenging scenarios like the cold-start issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing recommendation systems struggle with cold-start and sparse-data scenarios due to redundant pseudo-interactions or reliance on static semantic similarity, failing to capture dynamic user motivations.

Method: The framework M-$LLM^3$REC combines three modules: MOPE (Motivation-Oriented Profile Extractor), MOTE (Motivation-Oriented Trait Encoder), and MAR (Motivational Alignment Recommender), leveraging large language models for motivation-centered recommendation.

Result: M-$LLM^3$REC delivers robust and personalized recommendations, especially excelling in cold-start scenarios, and outperforms state-of-the-art solutions.

Conclusion: M-$LLM^3$REC proves the effectiveness of leveraging motivation-driven semantic modeling for personalized and generalizable recommendations, addressing major challenges in recommendation systems.

Abstract: Recommendation systems have been essential for both user experience and
platform efficiency by alleviating information overload and supporting
decision-making. Traditional methods, i.e., content-based filtering,
collaborative filtering, and deep learning, have achieved impressive results in
recommendation systems. However, the cold-start and sparse-data scenarios are
still challenging to deal with. Existing solutions either generate
pseudo-interaction sequence, which often introduces redundant or noisy signals,
or rely heavily on semantic similarity, overlooking dynamic shifts in user
motivation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel
recommendation framework, termed M-$LLM^3$REC, which leverages large language
models for deep motivational signal extraction from limited user interactions.
M-$LLM^3$REC comprises three integrated modules: the Motivation-Oriented
Profile Extractor (MOPE), Motivation-Oriented Trait Encoder (MOTE), and
Motivational Alignment Recommender (MAR). By emphasizing motivation-driven
semantic modeling, M-$LLM^3$REC demonstrates robust, personalized, and
generalizable recommendations, particularly boosting performance in cold-start
situations in comparison with the state-of-the-art frameworks.

*Mandeep Rathee,Venktesh V,Sean MacAvaney,Avishek Anand*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper surveys advancements in making Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems more dynamic by integrating feedback into retrieval and ranking processes, moving beyond static designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional RAG systems, which treat retrieval and reasoning as isolated processes, and explore how adaptive feedback mechanisms can improve performance on complex tasks.

Method: The paper categorizes advanced retrieval and ranking methods that utilize feedback signals, based on their source and purpose, to improve different aspects of the RAG pipeline.

Result: A structured overview consolidating various developments in adaptive feedback methods is presented, highlighting the integration of IR and NLP perspectives.

Conclusion: Retrieval should be viewed as a dynamic, learnable component to enhance the end-to-end performance of RAG systems, especially for complex or high-precision tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard framework for
knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, combining large language models (LLMs) with
document retrieval from external corpora. Despite its widespread use, most RAG
pipelines continue to treat retrieval and reasoning as isolated components,
retrieving documents once and then generating answers without further
interaction. This static design often limits performance on complex tasks that
require iterative evidence gathering or high-precision retrieval. Recent work
in both the information retrieval (IR) and NLP communities has begun to close
this gap by introducing adaptive retrieval and ranking methods that incorporate
feedback. In this survey, we present a structured overview of advanced
retrieval and ranking mechanisms that integrate such feedback. We categorize
feedback signals based on their source and role in improving the query,
retrieved context, or document pool. By consolidating these developments, we
aim to bridge IR and NLP perspectives and highlight retrieval as a dynamic,
learnable component of end-to-end RAG systems.

*Yi Xu,Moyu Zhang,Chenxuan Li,Zhihao Liao,Haibo Xing,Hao Deng,Jinxin Hu,Yu Zhang,Xiaoyi Zeng,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMQ, a new framework overcoming limitations in traditional recommender systems by using multimodal content to create better semantic representations for scalable and efficient recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommender systems using ItemIDs struggle with scalability and generalization due to sparse and dynamic item data; the paper aims to improve these with semantic-based approaches.

Method: Authors propose MMQ, a framework consisting of two stages: a multi-expert tokenizer integrating modality-specific and shared experts for leveraging multimodal content; and behavior-aware fine-tuning for aligning semantic IDs with user preferences.

Result: Experiments, both offline and online, confirm MMQ's efficacy in unifying multimodal synergy, specificity, and behavioral adaptations for improved recommendation tasks.

Conclusion: MMQ provides a scalable, versatile solution for addressing challenges in recommender systems through its integration of multimodal content and adaptive behaviors towards user preferences.

Abstract: Recommender systems traditionally represent items using unique identifiers
(ItemIDs), but this approach struggles with large, dynamic item corpora and
sparse long-tail data, limiting scalability and generalization. Semantic IDs,
derived from multimodal content such as text and images, offer a promising
alternative by mapping items into a shared semantic space, enabling knowledge
transfer and improving recommendations for new or rare items. However, existing
methods face two key challenges: (1) balancing cross-modal synergy with
modality-specific uniqueness, and (2) bridging the semantic-behavioral gap,
where semantic representations may misalign with actual user preferences. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Mixture-of-Quantization (MMQ),
a two-stage framework that trains a novel multimodal tokenizer. First, a
shared-specific tokenizer leverages a multi-expert architecture with
modality-specific and modality-shared experts, using orthogonal regularization
to capture comprehensive multimodal information. Second, behavior-aware
fine-tuning dynamically adapts semantic IDs to downstream recommendation
objectives while preserving modality information through a multimodal
reconstruction loss. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests
demonstrate that MMQ effectively unifies multimodal synergy, specificity, and
behavioral adaptation, providing a scalable and versatile solution for both
generative retrieval and discriminative ranking tasks.

TL;DR: The paper explores a variety of two-dimensional many-body memory systems capable of long-term information retention, revealing new dynamics beyond the established Toom's rule.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand the understanding of two-dimensional many-body memory systems and explore methods to retain information despite perturbations.

Method: The authors use a combination of rigorous mathematical proofs and machine learning techniques to analyze 2D memory dynamics.

Result: The study identifies several new types of memory systems that retain information through mechanisms distinct from Toom's rule, including error correction, stabilization by fluctuations, and dependence on noise.

Conclusion: The findings reveal that robust information storage is achievable in diverse ways, highlighting a richer landscape for many-body memory systems than previously recognized.

Abstract: We investigate the landscape of many-body memories: families of local
non-equilibrium dynamics that retain information about their initial conditions
for thermodynamically long time scales, even in the presence of arbitrary
perturbations. In two dimensions, the only well-studied memory is Toom's rule.
Using a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show
that the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories
that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have
ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the
presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can
perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that
the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Flow Matching-based machine learning framework for efficient sampling in lattice models, exemplified by the 2D XY model, demonstrating scalability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the computational limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in scaling to larger system sizes and exploring continuous temperature ranges.

Method: Flow Matching framework combined with CNN architecture, trained on a smaller lattice ($32×32$), to generalize across larger lattices ($128×128$) and temperatures without retraining.

Result: Generated configurations exhibit strong alignment with thermodynamic observables and effectively capture the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition.

Conclusion: The method establishes a scalable and computationally efficient approach for studying critical phenomena, applicable to various classical or quantum many-body systems on lattices.

Abstract: We propose a machine learning framework based on Flow Matching to overcome
the scaling limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We
demonstrate its capability in the 2D XY model, where a single network, trained
only on configurations from a small ($32\times 32$) lattice at sparse
temperature points, generates reliable samples for a significantly larger
system ($128\times 128$) across a continuous temperature range without
retraining. The generated configurations show strong agreement with key
thermodynamic observables and correctly capture the signatures of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This dual generalization is
enabled by the Flow Matching framework, which allows us to learn a continuous,
temperature-conditioned mapping. At the same time, the inductive biases of the
underlying CNN architecture ensure that the learned local physical rules are
scale-invariant. This "train-small, generate-large" capability establishes a
new paradigm for efficiently studying critical phenomena, offering a
significant computational advantage for exploring the thermodynamic limit. The
method can be directly applied to other classical or quantum many-body systems
described by continuous fields on a lattice.

Conclusion: This work supports the development of scalable quantum communication networks and addresses integration challenges within quantum systems engineering.

Abstract: Realisation of significant advances in capabilities of sensors, computing,

with respect to increasing stakeholder expectations. The result contributes to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in phase contrast imaging, where conventional methods require prior knowledge, manual tuning, or specific approximations that may limit their applicability in diverse experimental setups.

Method: The paper employs a physics-informed generative adversarial network (GAN) that reconstructs both phase and absorbance information from a single hologram, eliminating the need for paired or unpaired training data.

Result: The technique provided consistent and robust phase retrieval across various sample types and conditions, showing high-quality reconstruction capabilities on both simulated and experimental datasets.

Conclusion: This approach broadens the applicability of phase retrieval in X-ray imaging, demonstrating its utility for varied experimental setups, eliminating the need for prior training data, and maintaining quantitative accuracy for both simulated and real-world cases.

Abstract: X-ray phase contrast imaging significantly improves the visualization of
structures with weak or uniform absorption, broadening its applications across
a wide range of scientific disciplines. Propagation-based phase contrast is
particularly suitable for time- or dose-critical in vivo/in situ/operando
(tomography) experiments because it requires only a single intensity
measurement. However, the phase information of the wave field is lost during
the measurement and must be recovered. Conventional algebraic and iterative
methods often rely on specific approximations or boundary conditions that may
not be met by many samples or experimental setups. In addition, they require
manual tuning of reconstruction parameters by experts, making them less
adaptable for complex or variable conditions. Here we present a self-learning
approach for solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval in the near-field
regime of Fresnel theory using a single intensity measurement (hologram). A
physics-informed generative adversarial network is employed to reconstruct both
the phase and absorbance of the unpropagated wave field in the sample plane
from a single hologram. Unlike most deep learning approaches for phase
retrieval, our approach does not require paired, unpaired, or simulated
training data. This significantly broadens the applicability of our approach,
as acquiring or generating suitable training data remains a major challenge due
to the wide variability in sample types and experimental configurations. The
algorithm demonstrates robust and consistent performance across diverse imaging
conditions and sample types, delivering quantitative, high-quality
reconstructions for both simulated data and experimental datasets acquired at
beamline P05 at PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg), operated by Helmholtz-Zentrum
Hereon. Furthermore, it enables the simultaneous retrieval of both phase and
absorption information.

### [292] [Inference Time Debiasing Concepts in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14933)
*Lucas S. Kupssinskü,Marco N. Bochernitsan,Jordan Kopper,Otávio Parraga,Rodrigo C. Barros*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeCoDi, a method to reduce biases in text-to-image diffusion models without compromising quality or requiring intensive computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the biases (e.g., gender, ethnicity, age) inherent in text-to-image diffusion models and make debiasing methods accessible to more practitioners.

Method: DeCoDi alters the inference process of diffusion-based models to avoid biased latent dimensions, requiring minimal computation changes.

Result: The method was manually evaluated on 1,200 images and automatically by GPT4o, showing success in mitigating biases while maintaining inter-evaluator agreement and diversity.

Conclusion: DeCoDi is effective and accessible for debiasing diffusion-based image generation models, enhancing diversity and fairness in generated content.

Abstract: We propose DeCoDi, a debiasing procedure for text-to-image diffusion-based
models that changes the inference procedure, does not significantly change
image quality, has negligible compute overhead, and can be applied in any
diffusion-based image generation model. DeCoDi changes the diffusion process to
avoid latent dimension regions of biased concepts. While most deep learning
debiasing methods require complex or compute-intensive interventions, our
method is designed to change only the inference procedure. Therefore, it is
more accessible to a wide range of practitioners. We show the effectiveness of
the method by debiasing for gender, ethnicity, and age for the concepts of
nurse, firefighter, and CEO. Two distinct human evaluators manually inspect
1,200 generated images. Their evaluation results provide evidence that our
method is effective in mitigating biases based on gender, ethnicity, and age.
We also show that an automatic bias evaluation performed by the GPT4o is not
significantly statistically distinct from a human evaluation. Our evaluation
shows promising results, with reliable levels of agreement between evaluators
and more coverage of protected attributes. Our method has the potential to
significantly improve the diversity of images it generates by diffusion-based
text-to-image generative models.

*Zhongjun Ding,Yin Lin,Tianjing Zeng*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: AmbiSQL is an interactive system aimed at addressing query ambiguities in Text-to-SQL systems, improving their accuracy by leveraging user feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper targets the issue of query ambiguity in Text-to-SQL systems, which can lead to misinterpretations and inaccurate SQL generation, hindering broader usability.

Method: A fine-grained ambiguity taxonomy is proposed to detect ambiguities affecting database element mapping and LLM reasoning. The system uses interactive multiple-choice questions for user clarification and rewrites queries based on feedback.

Result: AmbiSQL achieves 87.2% precision in detecting ambiguities and boosts SQL exact match accuracy by 50%, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing Text-to-SQL system performance.

Conclusion: AmbiSQL substantially enhances the usability and accuracy of Text-to-SQL systems by addressing query ambiguity issues. The system integrates detection, user clarification, and feedback incorporation successfully.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into SQL queries,
providing substantial value for non-expert users. While large language models
(LLMs) show promising results for this task, they remain error-prone. Query
ambiguity has been recognized as a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL
systems, leading to misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL
generation. We demonstrate AmbiSQL, an interactive system that automatically
detects query ambiguities and guides users through intuitive multiple-choice
questions to clarify their intent. Our approach introduces a fine-grained
ambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities that affect database element
mapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous
questions. Evaluation on an ambiguous query dataset shows that AmbiSQL achieves
87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by
50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems. Our demonstration showcases the
significant performance gains and highlights the system's practical usability.

*Hadrien Pujol,Matteo Bevillacqua,Christophe Thirard,Thierry Mazoyer*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Acoem developed a lightweight neural network-based gunshot detection system for noisy moving military vehicle environments, which significantly improves detection rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance gunshot detection and localization accuracy in noisy battlefield environments, especially when mounted on moving vehicles.

Method: Utilized a lightweight neural network architecture (two hidden layer perceptron) combined with effective signal processing to mitigate noise effects.

Result: The detection rate of muzzle blast waveforms more than doubled under noisy conditions using the proposed method.

Conclusion: The lightweight neural network effectively improves gunshot detection performance while ensuring compatibility with resource-limited hardware.

Abstract: Acoem develops gunshot detection systems, consisting of a microphone array
and software that detects and locates shooters on the battlefield. The
performance of such systems is obviously affected by the acoustic environment
in which they are operating: in particular, when mounted on a moving military
vehicle, the presence of noise reduces the detection performance of the
software. To limit the influence of the acoustic environment, a neural network
has been developed. Instead of using a heavy convolutional neural network, a
lightweight neural network architecture was chosen to limit the computational
resources required to embed the algorithm on as many hardware platforms as
possible. Thanks to the combination of a two hidden layer perceptron and
appropriate signal processing techniques, the detection rate of impulsive
muzzle blast waveforms (the wave coming from the detonation and indicating the
position of the shooter) is significantly increased. With a rms value of noise
of the same order as the muzzle blast peak amplitude, the detect rate is more
than doubled with this denoising processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance dynamic speech emotion recognition by accounting for sequences of emotions and to improve emotional 3D avatar animation quality using better modeling techniques.

Method: The proposed method involves training a classical speech emotion recognition model, generating synthetic emotional sequences, improving the model via human feedback, and introducing the Dirichlet distribution to model emotional mixtures.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the Dirichlet-based approach is effective in modeling emotional mixtures. Human feedback further refines the model and simplifies the annotation process.

Conclusion: The combination of the Dirichlet-based model and human feedback improves the performance of dynamic speech emotion recognition methods, particularly for animating emotional 3D avatars.

Abstract: This work proposes to explore a new area of dynamic speech emotion
recognition. Unlike traditional methods, we assume that each audio track is
associated with a sequence of emotions active at different moments in time. The
study particularly focuses on the animation of emotional 3D avatars. We propose
a multi-stage method that includes the training of a classical speech emotion
recognition model, synthetic generation of emotional sequences, and further
model improvement based on human feedback. Additionally, we introduce a novel
approach to modeling emotional mixtures based on the Dirichlet distribution.
The models are evaluated based on ground-truth emotions extracted from a
dataset of 3D facial animations. We compare our models against the sliding
window approach. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of
Dirichlet-based approach in modeling emotional mixtures. Incorporating human
feedback further improves the model quality while providing a simplified
annotation procedure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve interpretability and diagnostic capabilities in analyzing cough sounds for respiratory disease management using AI.

Method: Utilizes occlusion maps in conjunction with CNN to identify key spectral regions in cough spectrograms and performs spectral analysis on those regions.

Result: Significant spectral differences found among disease groups, especially for COPD patients, showcasing variability in specific spectral regions highlighted by occlusion maps.

Conclusion: XAI techniques enhance cough sound analysis by offering interpretable results that uncover disease-specific acoustic signatures and potentially aid diagnostics.

Abstract: This paper proposes an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-driven
methodology to enhance the understanding of cough sound analysis for
respiratory disease management. We employ occlusion maps to highlight relevant
spectral regions in cough spectrograms processed by a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN). Subsequently, spectral analysis of spectrograms weighted by
these occlusion maps reveals significant differences between disease groups,
particularly in patients with COPD, where cough patterns appear more variable
in the identified spectral regions of interest. This contrasts with the lack of
significant differences observed when analyzing raw spectrograms. The proposed
approach extracts and analyzes several spectral features, demonstrating the
potential of XAI techniques to uncover disease-specific acoustic signatures and
improve the diagnostic capabilities of cough sound analysis by providing more
interpretable results.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new audio feature and a parameter-free feature enhancement approach to improve Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD) in machines, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of uncertain anomaly locations and redundant noise in machine sounds that hinder ASD system performance.

Method: Proposing a novel audio feature based on evenly spaced filter banks and introducing a parameter-free feature enhancement technique leveraging pre-trained models for effective knowledge transfer.

Result: The proposed methods significantly improved ASD performance on the DCASE 2024 Challenge dataset.

Conclusion: The methods proposed overcome key challenges in ASD by enhancing anomaly detection and leveraging pre-trained knowledge, marking a notable advancement in the field.

Abstract: Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD) aims at identifying anomalous sounds from
machines and has gained extensive research interests from both academia and
industry. However, the uncertainty of anomaly location and much redundant
information such as noise in machine sounds hinder the improvement of ASD
system performance. This paper proposes a novel audio feature of filter banks
with evenly distributed intervals, ensuring equal attention to all frequency
ranges in the audio, which enhances the detection of anomalies in machine
sounds. Moreover, based on pre-trained models, this paper presents a
parameter-free feature enhancement approach to remove redundant information in
machine audio. It is believed that this parameter-free strategy facilitates the
effective transfer of universal knowledge from pre-trained tasks to the ASD
task during model fine-tuning. Evaluation results on the Detection and
Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2024 Challenge dataset
demonstrate significant improvements in ASD performance with our proposed
methods.

Motivation: To identify the most effective machine learning techniques for accurately predicting hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs) using a binary classification framework.

Method: The paper evaluates six machine learning classifiers — RFC, GBC, SVC, LDA, LR, and KNN — through preprocessing steps like data scaling, power transformation, and cross-validation, and compares their performances using metrics like F2-score and confusion matrices.

Result: RFC and GBC showed the highest F2-scores (0.987 and 0.986) and outstanding accuracy rates (99.7% and 99.6%), while SVC performed moderately well, and LDA, LR, and KNN underperformed.

Conclusion: Ensemble methods such as RFC and GBC demonstrate superior performance for NEO hazard prediction, emphasizing the importance of tailored model selection and the potential for further improvement through hyperparameter optimization and feature engineering.

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of several machine learning models for
predicting hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs) through a binary classification
framework, including data scaling, power transformation, and cross-validation.
Six classifiers were compared, namely Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Gradient
Boosting Classifier (GBC), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). RFC
and GBC performed the best, both with an impressive F2-score of 0.987 and
0.986, respectively, with very small variability. SVC followed, with a lower
but reasonable score of 0.896. LDA and LR had a moderate performance with
scores of around 0.749 and 0.748, respectively, while KNN had a poor
performance with a score of 0.691 due to difficulty in handling complex data
patterns. RFC and GBC also presented great confusion matrices with a negligible
number of false positives and false negatives, which resulted in outstanding
accuracy rates of 99.7% and 99.6%, respectively. These findings highlight the
power of ensemble methods for high precision and recall and further point out
the importance of tailored model selection with regard to dataset
characteristics and chosen evaluation metrics. Future research could focus on
the optimization of hyperparameters with advanced features engineering to
further the accuracy and robustness of the model on NEO hazard predictions.

TL;DR: The study explored the use of speech, specifically Chinese syllables, for identifying heart failure (HF) and validated their utility using a new database of HF patient recordings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to explore whether Chinese syllables exhibit heart failure-related features like those found in other languages, using speech as a non-intrusive diagnostic tool.

Method: This study introduced a Chinese speech database of HF patients with recordings captured before and after hospitalization, and employed both patient-wise and pair-wise classification methods. An Adaptive Frequency Filter (AFF) was also proposed to analyze frequency importance.

Result: The findings demonstrate that the Chinese language is effective for HF detection, with pair-wise classification showing promising potential for minimizing speaker-related variability. Statistical tests identified individual differences as notable sources of inaccuracy.

Conclusion: The study confirms Chinese speech's potential in HF detection and introduces the pair-wise classification alongside AFF for future research, contributing to improving speaker-independent diagnostic methods.

Abstract: Speech is a cost-effective and non-intrusive data source for identifying
acute and chronic heart failure (HF). However, there is a lack of research on
whether Chinese syllables contain HF-related information, as observed in other
well-studied languages. This study presents the first Chinese speech database
of HF patients, featuring paired recordings taken before and after
hospitalisation. The findings confirm the effectiveness of the Chinese language
in HF detection using both standard 'patient-wise' and personalised 'pair-wise'
classification approaches, with the latter serving as an ideal
speaker-decoupled baseline for future research. Statistical tests and
classification results highlight individual differences as key contributors to
inaccuracy. Additionally, an adaptive frequency filter (AFF) is proposed for
frequency importance analysis. The data and demonstrations are published at

TL;DR: The paper presents GOAT, a post-training framework for LM-based TTS systems, that reduces hallucinations efficiently without heavy resource requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LM-based TTS systems often produce hallucinated speech not aligned with input text, and existing solutions are resource-intensive or slow.

Method: GOAT addresses hallucinations by analyzing the link between hallucinations and model uncertainty, and reformulating TTS generation as trajectory flow optimization using enhanced objectives and refined internal rewards.

Result: GOAT achieves a 50% reduction in character error rates on difficult cases and reduces uncertainty by 58%, showcasing improved performance.

Conclusion: GOAT is a resource-efficient and highly effective approach for minimizing hallucinations in LM-based TTS systems, with strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Language Model (LM)-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems often generate
hallucinated speech that deviates from input text. Existing mitigation
strategies either demand excessive training resources or introduce significant
inference latency. In this paper, we propose GFlOwNet-guided distribution
AlignmenT (GOAT) for LM-based TTS, a post-training framework that mitigates
hallucinations without relying on massive resources or inference cost.
Specifically, we first conduct an uncertainty analysis, revealing a strong
positive correlation between hallucination and model uncertainty. Based on
this, we reformulate TTS generation as a trajectory flow optimization problem
and introduce an enhanced Subtrajectory Balance objective together with a
sharpened internal reward as target distribution. We further integrate reward
temperature decay and learning rate optimization for stability and performance
balance. Extensive experiments show that GOAT reduce over 50% character error
rates on challenging test cases and lowering uncertainty by up to 58%,
demonstrating its strong generalization ability and effectiveness.

TL;DR: HEAS is a Python framework combining layered agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization in a reproducible workflow, focusing on cross-disciplinary applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify agent-based modeling, optimization, and evaluative processes in a reproducible and efficient approach.

Method: HEAS employs deterministic layered processes, a shared context, compact APIs, and a standardized evaluation framework with various tools for analysis and plotting.

Result: The framework demonstrates adaptability to diverse use cases such as ecological systems and enterprise decision-making, emphasizing reproducible and reliable results.

Conclusion: HEAS serves as a robust platform for multi-level, cross-disciplinary research, enhancing comparability and reducing code overhead for studies.

Abstract: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation (HEAS) is a Python framework that
unifies layered agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and
tournament evaluation in a single, reproducible workflow. HEAS represents
models as hierarchies of lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in
deterministic layers that read and write a shared context, making cross-scale
couplings explicit and auditable. A compact API and CLI-simulate, optimize,
evaluate-expose single- and multi-objective evolution, PyTorch policy
integration via parameter flattening/unflattening, and general tournament
tooling with user-defined scoring and voting rules. The framework standardizes
evaluation through uniform per-step and episode metrics, persists seeds,
logbooks, and hall-of-fame archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces,
Pareto fronts, and comparative outcomes, reducing glue code and improving
comparability across studies. HEAS emphasizes separation of mechanism from
orchestration, allowing exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators
to be composed and swapped without refactoring, while the same model can be
used for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison. We
illustrate usage with two compact examples-an ecological system and an
enterprise decision-making setting. HEAS offers a practical foundation for
cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry, yielding reliable, reproducible
results.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEN2, a novel framework using prediction and ML correction to efficiently model climate extreme statistics, outperforming Earth System Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome computational challenges in modeling climate extremes due to large ensemble requirements across emissions scenarios using traditional Earth System Models.

Method: Developing GEN2, a two-step model combining conditional Gaussian prediction and non-Gaussian machine learning correction trained on nudged emulations and reference data for accuracy under chaotic systems.

Result: GEN2 was validated on ERA5 historical data, proving accurate in predicting extreme event statistics and capable of generalizing to future climate scenarios based on limited training data.

Conclusion: GEN2 offers an efficient and effective solution to quantify climate extremes, achieving reliable extrapolation beyond training data distributions.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying the increased risks of climate extremes requires
generating large ensembles of climate realization across a wide range of
emissions scenarios, which is computationally challenging for conventional
Earth System Models. We propose GEN2, a generative prediction-correction
framework for an efficient and accurate forecast of the extreme event
statistics. The prediction step is constructed as a conditional Gaussian
emulator, followed by a non-Gaussian machine-learning (ML) correction step. The
ML model is trained on pairs of the reference data and the emulated fields
nudged towards the reference, to ensure the training is robust to chaos. We
first validate the accuracy of our model on historical ERA5 data and then
demonstrate the extrapolation capabilities on various future climate change
scenarios. When trained on a single realization of one warming scenario, our
model accurately predicts the statistics of extreme events in different
scenarios, successfully extrapolating beyond the distribution of training data.

Motivation: The lack of efficient methods to map quantum programs onto distributed quantum computing systems, particularly in the context of heterogeneous quantum processing units with varied structures, creates challenges that limit the practicality and scalability of DQC.

Method: The proposed framework incorporates three main strategies: leveraging structural patterns in quantum circuits, employing clustering techniques for qubit placement, and optimizing qubit mapping using annealing algorithms.

Result: The presented framework outperforms baseline methods, reducing the objective value by up to 88.40%, showcasing its ability to efficiently handle complex and heterogeneous DQC systems.

Conclusion: The framework addresses critical challenges in DQC by promoting more efficient quantum program mapping, facilitating the utilization of heterogeneous QPUs, and yielding promising experimental results.

Abstract: Efficiently mapping quantum programs onto Distributed quantum computing (DQC)
are challenging, particularly when considering the heterogeneous quantum

comprehensive compilation framework that addresses these challenges with three
key insights: exploiting structural patterns within quantum circuits, using
clustering for initial qubit placement, and adjusting qubit mapping with
annealing algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
methods and the capability to handle complex heterogeneous distributed quantum

Motivation: To explore the unexplored mathematical equivalence between SVM kernels and quantum propagators to enhance machine learning models in physical systems.

Method: The authors demonstrate kernel-Green function correspondence using operator theory and propose a Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) for designing new kernels aligned with Green's functions.

Result: Numerical experiments validate that positive-semidefinite kernels based on Green's functions enhance SVM predictive accuracy in physical systems.

Conclusion: Aligning SVM kernels with Green's functions offers a novel approach that improves predictive performance for physical systems while expanding kernel design possibilities.

Abstract: We establish a mathematical equivalence between Support Vector Machine (SVM)
kernel functions and quantum propagators represented by time-dependent Green's
functions, which has remained largely unexplored.
  We demonstrate that many common SVM kernels correspond naturally to Green's
functions via operator inversion theory. The sigmoid kernel does not always
satisfy Mercer's theorem, and therefore the corresponding Green's function may
also fail to perform optimally.
  We further introduce a Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) for designing
customized kernels that align with Green's functions.
  Our numerical experiments confirm that employing positive-semidefinite
kernels that correspond to Green's functions significantly improves predictive
accuracy of SVM models in physical systems.

Abstract: The rapid development of machine learning and quantum computing has placed
quantum machine learning at the forefront of research. However, existing
quantum machine learning algorithms based on quantum variational algorithms
face challenges in trainability and noise robustness. In order to address these
challenges, we introduce a gradient-free, noise-robust quantum reservoir
computing algorithm that harnesses discrete time crystal dynamics as a
reservoir. We first calibrate the memory, nonlinear, and information scrambling
capacities of the quantum reservoir, revealing their correlation with dynamical
phases and non-equilibrium phase transitions. We then apply the algorithm to
the binary classification task and establish a comparative quantum kernel
advantage. For ten-class classification, both noisy simulations and
experimental results on superconducting quantum processors match ideal
simulations, demonstrating the enhanced accuracy with increasing system size
and confirming the topological noise robustness. Our work presents the first
experimental demonstration of quantum reservoir computing for image
classification based on digital quantum simulation. It establishes the
correlation between quantum many-body non-equilibrium phase transitions and
quantum machine learning performance, providing new design principles for
quantum reservoir computing and broader quantum machine learning algorithms in
the NISQ era.

### [308] [Computational Resolution of Hadamard Product Factorization for $4 \times 4$ Matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14901)
*Igor Rivin*

Main category: math.RA

TL;DR: The paper resolves an open problem of representing full-rank $4 \times 4$ matrices as Hadamard products of rank-2 matrices, finding that 26.3% of the matrices are counterexamples and identifying underlying algebraic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate whether full-rank $4 \times 4$ matrices can universally be expressed as Hadamard products of two rank-2 matrices, addressing known open mathematical problems.

Method: The authors conduct exhaustive computational searches over finite fields ($\mathbb{F}_2$), verify results over integers ($\mathbb{Z}$) and provide numerical evidence for real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$). Machine learning techniques are used to study patterns.

Result: Out of 20,160 binary matrices, 5,304 are found to be counterexamples (26.3%). The study identifies an emergent low-dimensional variety in expressible matrices, contrasting the naive expectation of higher-dimensional parameterization.

Conclusion: The findings reveal that matrix density and deep algebraic constraints dictate Hadamard factorizability, suggesting a lower-dimensional structure rather than random high-dimensional characteristics.

Abstract: We computationally resolve an open problem concerning the expressibility of
$4 \times 4$ full-rank matrices as Hadamard products of two rank-2 matrices.
Through exhaustive search over $\mathbb{F}_2$, we identify 5,304
counterexamples among the 20,160 full-rank binary matrices (26.3\%). We verify
that these counterexamples remain valid over $\mathbb{Z}$ through sign
enumeration and provide strong numerical evidence for their validity over
$\mathbb{R}$.
  Remarkably, our analysis reveals that matrix density (number of ones) is
highly predictive of expressibility, achieving 95.7\% classification accuracy.
Using modern machine learning techniques, we discover that expressible matrices
lie on an approximately 10-dimensional variety within the 16-dimensional
ambient space, despite the naive parameter count of 24 (12 parameters each for
two $4 \times 4$ rank-2 matrices). This emergent low-dimensional structure
suggests deep algebraic constraints governing Hadamard factorizability.

### [309] [A U-Statistic-based random forest approach for genetic interaction study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14924)
*Ming Li,Ruo-Sin Peng,Changshuai Wei,Qing Lu*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Forest U-Test, a novel U-Statistic-based random forest method for identifying genetic interactions in complex traits, demonstrating its effectiveness and replicability in cannabis dependence studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of identifying gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in studying complex traits, which is limited due to high-dimensional feature spaces and computational demands.

Method: The authors propose a U-Statistic-based random forest method, known as Forest U-Test, and validate its performance through simulations and real-world cannabis dependence datasets.

Result: Forest U-Test outperforms existing methods in simulation studies and reveals significant joint associations with cannabis dependence, replicable across independent datasets.

Conclusion: Forest U-Test is effective for detecting genetic associations in high-dimensional data, making progress in understanding complex traits and interactions.

Abstract: Variations in complex traits are influenced by multiple genetic variants,
environmental risk factors, and their interactions. Though substantial progress
has been made in identifying single genetic variants associated with complex
traits, detecting the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions remains a
great challenge. When a large number of genetic variants and environmental risk
factors are involved, searching for interactions is limited to pair-wise
interactions due to the exponentially increased feature space and computational
intensity. Alternatively, recursive partitioning approaches, such as random
forests, have gained popularity in high-dimensional genetic association
studies. In this article, we propose a U-Statistic-based random forest
approach, referred to as Forest U-Test, for genetic association studies with
quantitative traits. Through simulation studies, we showed that the Forest
U-Test outperformed existing methods. The proposed method was also applied to
study Cannabis Dependence CD, using three independent datasets from the Study
of Addiction: Genetics and Environment. A significant joint association was
detected with an empirical p-value less than 0.001. The finding was also
replicated in two independent datasets with p-values of 5.93e-19 and 4.70e-17,
respectively.

*Manuel Serna-Aguilera,Fiona L. Goggin,Aranyak Goswami,Alexander Bucksch,Suxing Liu,Khoa Luu*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Arabidopsis Genomics-Phenomics (AGP) Dataset, a multi-modal dataset linking gene expression profiles with phenotypic trait measurements in Arabidopsis thaliana. This dataset addresses limitations in current datasets by integrating multi-modal genetic and phenotype data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the gene-to-trait linkage in organisms, which remains a fundamental challenge in biology, necessitated the development of an integrated dataset. Current datasets lack genetic and phenotypic interplay and operate on disjoint data, limiting machine learning models' predictive ability.

Method: The authors created the AGP dataset by curating and integrating multi-modal gene expression and phenotypic trait data for Arabidopsis thaliana specimens. They benchmarked various models, including conventional regression and graph-based approaches, to validate the dataset's efficacy in predicting phenotypes.

Result: The AGP dataset provides linked genetic and phenotype data for Arabidopsis thaliana, supporting advanced predictive tasks such as phenotype prediction and graph learning. Their benchmarks demonstrate the dataset's potential to improve gene-trait association validation.

Conclusion: AGP is the first dataset to present multi-modal genetic and phenotypic data for Arabidopsis thaliana. It aims to advance machine learning algorithms for genome-to-phenome challenges by fostering better understanding of gene-trait links using integrated biological data.

Abstract: Understanding which genes control which traits in an organism remains one of
the central challenges in biology. Despite significant advances in data
collection technology, our ability to map genes to traits is still limited.
This genome-to-phenome (G2P) challenge spans several problem domains, including
plant breeding, and requires models capable of reasoning over high-dimensional,
heterogeneous, and biologically structured data. Currently, however, many
datasets solely capture genetic information or solely capture phenotype
information. Additionally, phenotype data is very heterogeneous, which many
datasets do not fully capture. The critical drawback is that these datasets are
not integrated, that is, they do not link with each other to describe the same
biological specimens. This limits machine learning models' ability to be
informed on the various aspects of these specimens, impacting the breadth of
correlations learned, and therefore their ability to make more accurate
predictions. To address this gap, we present the Arabidopsis Genomics-Phenomics
(AGP) Dataset, a curated multi-modal dataset linking gene expression profiles
with phenotypic trait measurements in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism in
plant biology. AGP supports tasks such as phenotype prediction and
interpretable graph learning. In addition, we benchmark conventional regression
and explanatory baselines, including a biologically-informed hypergraph
baseline, to validate gene-trait associations. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first dataset that provides multi-modal gene information and
heterogeneous trait or phenotype data for the same Arabidopsis thaliana
specimens. With AGP, we aim to foster the research community towards accurately
understanding the connection between genotypes and phenotypes using gene
information, higher-order gene pairings, and trait data from several sources.

### [311] [GenTune: Toward Traceable Prompts to Improve Controllability of Image Refinement in Environment Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15227)
*Wen-Fan Wang,Ting-Ying Lee,Chien-Ting Lu,Che-Wei Hsu,Nil Ponsa Campany,Yu Chen,Mike Y. Chen,Bing-Yu Chen*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenTune, a system that simplifies human-AI collaboration in designing 2D and 3D scenes by enabling designers to trace and revise AI-generated prompts for image refinement, addressing local and global consistency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designers face challenges of understanding and refining lengthy AI-generated prompts for text-to-image designs, as well as ensuring both localized edits and global visual consistency in their creative workflows.

Method: The GenTune system allows designers to select elements in an image, trace back corresponding prompt labels, and revise labels to achieve precise and globally consistent refinements. User studies with 10 formative and 20 summative participants validate this approach.

Result: GenTune improved prompt-to-image comprehension, refinement quality, efficiency, and designer satisfaction (all with statistical significance, $p < .01$), and was effective in real-world settings during a studio field study.

Conclusion: GenTune significantly enhances the creative workflow of designers in entertainment industries by addressing key pain points, promoting better human-AI collaboration, and aiding in the creation of consistent and refined visual content.

Abstract: Environment designers in the entertainment industry create imaginative 2D and
3D scenes for games, films, and television, requiring both fine-grained control
of specific details and consistent global coherence. Designers have
increasingly integrated generative AI into their workflows, often relying on
large language models (LLMs) to expand user prompts for text-to-image
generation, then iteratively refining those prompts and applying inpainting.
However, our formative study with 10 designers surfaced two key challenges: (1)
the lengthy LLM-generated prompts make it difficult to understand and isolate
the keywords that must be revised for specific visual elements; and (2) while
inpainting supports localized edits, it can struggle with global consistency
and correctness. Based on these insights, we present GenTune, an approach that
enhances human--AI collaboration by clarifying how AI-generated prompts map to
image content. Our GenTune system lets designers select any element in a
generated image, trace it back to the corresponding prompt labels, and revise
those labels to guide precise yet globally consistent image refinement. In a
summative study with 20 designers, GenTune significantly improved prompt--image
comprehension, refinement quality, and efficiency, and overall satisfaction
(all $p < .01$) compared to current practice. A follow-up field study with two
studios further demonstrated its effectiveness in real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interactive maps are limited to structured GIS data, and there is a need for solutions to handle nuanced visual-spatial questions based on real-world imagery.

Method: The paper discusses multimodal AI agents capable of leveraging geospatial image repositories, such as streetscapes, place-based photos, aerial images, and GIS data to answer geo-visual questions.

Result: Three use cases for Geo-Visual Agents are highlighted, along with sensing and interaction approaches and challenges specific to this vision.

Conclusion: Geo-Visual Agents represent a future direction for enhancing geographic understanding, enabling richer inquiries into the visual and spatial aspects of the world.

Abstract: Interactive digital maps have revolutionized how people travel and learn
about the world; however, they rely on pre-existing structured data in GIS
databases (e.g., road networks, POI indices), limiting their ability to address
geo-visual questions related to what the world looks like. We introduce our
vision for Geo-Visual Agents--multimodal AI agents capable of understanding and
responding to nuanced visual-spatial inquiries about the world by analyzing
large-scale repositories of geospatial images, including streetscapes (e.g.,
Google Street View), place-based photos (e.g., TripAdvisor, Yelp), and aerial
imagery (e.g., satellite photos) combined with traditional GIS data sources. We
define our vision, describe sensing and interaction approaches, provide three
exemplars, and enumerate key challenges and opportunities for future work.

*Hongqi Li,Yitong Chen,Yujuan Wang,Weihang Ni,Haodong Zhang*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a taxonomy for applying foundation models to EEG analysis, categorizing methods based on their output modalities and highlighting associated research, challenges, and opportunities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The surge in foundation model applications to EEG analysis has created a fragmented landscape in terms of roles, architectures, and categorizations, necessitating a unified framework.

Method: The authors propose a modality-oriented taxonomy that organizes EEG foundation model research into categories such as native EEG decoding, EEG-text, EEG-vision, EEG-audio, and multimodal frameworks. They analyze theoretical foundations, innovations, and challenges in each category.

Result: The taxonomy provides insights into research advances, identifies critical challenges like model interpretability and real-world applicability, and organizes the field for better understanding.

Conclusion: The study establishes a comprehensive framework to unify EEG foundation model research, enabling further advancements and facilitating their real-world deployment.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis stands at the forefront of neuroscience
and artificial intelligence research, where foundation models are reshaping the
traditional EEG analysis paradigm by leveraging their powerful representational
capacity and cross-modal generalization. However, the rapid proliferation of
these techniques has led to a fragmented research landscape, characterized by
diverse model roles, inconsistent architectures, and a lack of systematic
categorization. To bridge this gap, this study presents the first comprehensive
modality-oriented taxonomy for foundation models in EEG analysis,
systematically organizing research advances based on output modalities of the
native EEG decoding, EEG-text, EEG-vision, EEG-audio, and broader multimodal
frameworks. We rigorously analyze each category's research ideas, theoretical
foundations, and architectural innovations, while highlighting open challenges
such as model interpretability, cross-domain generalization, and real-world
applicability in EEG-based systems. By unifying this dispersed field, our work
not only provides a reference framework for future methodology development but
accelerates the translation of EEG foundation models into scalable,
interpretable, and online actionable solutions.

### [314] [Multiply Robust Conformal Risk Control with Coarsened Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15489)
*Manit Paul,Arun Kumar Kuchibhotla,Eric J. Tchetgen Tchetgen*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper extends Conformal Prediction (CP) methods to handle coarsened training data, integrating semiparametric theory and machine learning to create valid and robust prediction intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing Conformal Prediction methods, which assume complete training data, despite real-world scenarios often involving missing or censored data.

Method: The authors derive the efficient influence function for predicting outcome quantiles within a semiparametric model for coarsened data, combined with a novel conformal risk control procedure.

Result: The framework enables valid prediction intervals for coarsened data, performs well under covariate shifts, and supports robust predictions in monotone missingness cases.

Conclusion: The proposed approach achieves well-calibrated prediction intervals even with coarsened data, leveraging machine learning for practical applications and showing strong performance in simulations.

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) has recently received a tremendous amount of
interest, leading to a wide range of new theoretical and methodological results
for predictive inference with formal theoretical guarantees. However, the vast
majority of CP methods assume that all units in the training data have fully
observed data on both the outcome and covariates of primary interest, an
assumption that rarely holds in practice. In reality, training data are often
missing the outcome, a subset of covariates, or both on some units. In
addition, time-to-event outcomes in the training set may be censored due to
dropout or administrative end-of-follow-up. Accurately accounting for such
coarsened data in the training sample while fulfilling the primary objective of
well-calibrated conformal predictive inference, requires robustness and
efficiency considerations. In this paper, we consider the general problem of
obtaining distribution-free valid prediction regions for an outcome given
coarsened training data. Leveraging modern semiparametric theory, we achieve
our goal by deriving the efficient influence function of the quantile of the
outcome we aim to predict, under a given semiparametric model for the coarsened
data, carefully combined with a novel conformal risk control procedure. Our
principled use of semiparametric theory has the key advantage of facilitating
flexible machine learning methods such as random forests to learn the
underlying nuisance functions of the semiparametric model. A straightforward
application of the proposed general framework produces prediction intervals
with stronger coverage properties under covariate shift, as well as the
construction of multiply robust prediction sets in monotone missingness
scenarios. We further illustrate the performance of our methods through various
simulation studies.

*Guilherme V. Moura,André P. Santos,Hudson S. Torrent*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: This paper examines the use of machine learning to select relevant variables for creating minimum-variance portfolios, finding substantial benefits in risk reduction and potential improvements in returns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether machine learning can identify relevant variables for optimal portfolio choice, given the success of ML methods in predicting equity premiums.

Method: The authors parameterized minimum-variance portfolio weights using firm-level characteristics, second-order transformations, and cross-product transformations, amounting to 4,610 predictors.

Result: Employing machine learning to select predictors significantly lowers portfolio risk compared to sparsity-based methods, and in some cases, improves returns and Sharpe ratios.

Conclusion: Ad-hoc sparsity in predictor selection can harm the performance of minimum-variance portfolios, highlighting the advantages of utilizing machine learning.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) methods have been successfully employed in identifying
variables that can predict the equity premium of individual stocks. In this
paper, we investigate if ML can also be helpful in selecting variables relevant
for optimal portfolio choice. To address this question, we parameterize
minimum-variance portfolio weights as a function of a large pool of firm-level
characteristics as well as their second-order and cross-product
transformations, yielding a total of 4,610 predictors. We find that the gains
from employing ML to select relevant predictors are substantial:
minimum-variance portfolios achieve lower risk relative to sparse
specifications commonly considered in the literature, especially when
non-linear terms are added to the predictor space. Moreover, some of the
selected predictors that help decreasing portfolio risk also increase returns,
leading to minimum-variance portfolios with good performance in terms of Shape
ratios in some situations. Our evidence suggests that ad-hoc sparsity can be
detrimental to the performance of minimum-variance characteristics-based
portfolios.

### [316] [A Practical Guideline and Taxonomy to LLVM's Control Flow Integrity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15386)
*Sabine Houy,Bruno Kreyssig,Timothee Riom,Alexandre Bartel,Patrick McDaniel*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Control Flow Integrity (CFI) implementation in real-world software vulnerabilities, offering a taxonomy and guidelines for informed and improved integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory corruption vulnerabilities enable severe exploitation like arbitrary code execution, and Control Flow Integrity (CFI) has emerged as an approach to mitigate such risks. However, developers lack clear guidelines to apply CFI effectively to real-world software.

Method: The authors created a taxonomy linking LLVM's CFI variants to memory corruption vulnerabilities, evaluated CFI's effectiveness against four high-impact CVEs based on the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) list, and analyzed cases where CFI succeeds or fails.

Result: CFI successfully blocked exploitation for two of the studied CVEs but failed for the other two. This reveals both the strengths and current limitations of applying CFI to real-world systems.

Conclusion: CFI has potential for mitigating memory corruption vulnerabilities but requires improvements and tailored deployment strategies to address its limitations for broader and effective usage in production environments.

Abstract: Memory corruption vulnerabilities remain one of the most severe threats to
software security. They often allow attackers to achieve arbitrary code
execution by redirecting a vulnerable program's control flow. While Control
Flow Integrity (CFI) has gained traction to mitigate this exploitation path,
developers are not provided with any direction on how to apply CFI to
real-world software. In this work, we establish a taxonomy mapping LLVM's
forward-edge CFI variants to memory corruption vulnerability classes, offering
actionable guidance for developers seeking to deploy CFI incrementally in
existing codebases. Based on the Top 10 Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)
list, we identify four high-impact vulnerability categories and select one
representative CVE for each. We evaluate LLVM's CFI against each CVE and
explain why CFI blocks exploitation in two cases while failing in the other
two, illustrating its potential and current limitations. Our findings support
informed deployment decisions and provide a foundation for improving the
practical use of CFI in production systems.

TL;DR: The paper surveys Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs) on Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) platforms, categorizing attack/defense mechanisms and analyzing implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLaaS platforms simplify access to complex ML models but create vulnerabilities such as MEAs, necessitating evaluation and defense strategies.

Method: The paper proposes a taxonomy of MEAs, categorizes attack/defense mechanisms, evaluates challenges, and assesses implications across computing paradigms.

Result: The analysis highlights trade-offs in MEA defense strategies, effectiveness of attacks, and gaps in ensuring security while preserving model utility.

Conclusion: This work provides a systematic understanding of MEAs, defense approaches, and implications, aiming to guide AI security efforts and enable informed policymaking.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have significantly grown in complexity and
utility, driving advances across multiple domains. However, substantial
computational resources and specialized expertise have historically restricted
their wide adoption. Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) platforms have
addressed these barriers by providing scalable, convenient, and affordable
access to sophisticated ML models through user-friendly APIs. While this
accessibility promotes widespread use of advanced ML capabilities, it also
introduces vulnerabilities exploited through Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs).
Recent studies have demonstrated that adversaries can systematically replicate
a target model's functionality by interacting with publicly exposed interfaces,
posing threats to intellectual property, privacy, and system security. In this
paper, we offer a comprehensive survey of MEAs and corresponding defense
strategies. We propose a novel taxonomy that classifies MEAs according to
attack mechanisms, defense approaches, and computing environments. Our analysis
covers various attack techniques, evaluates their effectiveness, and highlights
challenges faced by existing defenses, particularly the critical trade-off
between preserving model utility and ensuring security. We further assess MEAs
within different computing paradigms and discuss their technical, ethical,
legal, and societal implications, along with promising directions for future
research. This systematic survey aims to serve as a valuable reference for
researchers, practitioners, and policymakers engaged in AI security and
privacy. Additionally, we maintain an online repository continuously updated

*Ruyi Ding,Tianhong Xu,Xinyi Shen,Aidong Adam Ding,Yunsi Fei*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'MoEcho,' identifying novel security vulnerabilities in Mixture of Experts (MoE) systems, and demonstrates their potential for privacy breaches in modern AI architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling modern AI systems while maintaining implementation efficiency is crucial, but security risks associated with MoE models have been underexplored.

Method: The authors unveiled four architectural side channels in MoE systems across CPUs and GPUs, exploiting these vulnerabilities to design four specific privacy-focused attacks.

Result: The identified side channels enable attackers to infer sensitive user data and compromise privacy in MoE systems utilized by large language models and vision-language models.

Conclusion: MoEcho underscores significant architectural security concerns in MoE-based systems, urging the need for safeguards to prevent privacy vulnerabilities in AI services.

Abstract: The transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern AI, fueling
remarkable progress across applications in natural language processing,
computer vision, and multimodal learning. As these models continue to scale
explosively for performance, implementation efficiency remains a critical
challenge. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, selectively activating
specialized subnetworks (experts), offer a unique balance between model
accuracy and computational cost. However, the adaptive routing in MoE
architectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized
experts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack
surface for privacy breaches. These input-dependent activation patterns leave
distinctive temporal and spatial traces in hardware execution, which
adversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data. In this work, we
propose MoEcho, discovering a side channel analysis based attack surface that
compromises user privacy on MoE based systems. Specifically, in MoEcho, we
introduce four novel architectural side channels on different computing
platforms, including Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and
Performance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs, respectively. Exploiting
these vulnerabilities, we propose four attacks that effectively breach user
privacy in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) based
on MoE architectures: Prompt Inference Attack, Response Reconstruction Attack,
Visual Inference Attack, and Visual Reconstruction Attack. MoEcho is the first
runtime architecture level security analysis of the popular MoE structure
common in modern transformers, highlighting a serious security and privacy
threat and calling for effective and timely safeguards when harnessing MoE
based models for developing efficient large scale AI services.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes RAGAN, a framework using multimodal foundation models to generate highly effective and imperceptible fake user profiles for poisoning attacks on recommender systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks with limited attacker knowledge, requiring profiles that are transferable and imperceptible.

Method: The paper leverages in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, augmented by a demonstration retrieval algorithm and text style transfer, to create high-quality fake user profiles optimized by collaborative agents.

Result: RAGAN shows state-of-the-art performance in poisoning attacks on various real-world datasets, achieving high effectiveness and imperceptibility.

Conclusion: The study advances the understanding of recommender system vulnerabilities by providing a novel framework to enhance attack quality and transferability.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that recommender systems (RSs) are highly
vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious actors inject fake user
profiles, including a group of well-designed fake ratings, to manipulate
recommendations. Due to security and privacy constraints in practice, attackers
typically possess limited knowledge of the victim system and thus need to craft
profiles that have transferability across black-box RSs. To maximize the attack
impact, the profiles often remains imperceptible. However, generating such
high-quality profiles with the restricted resources is challenging. Some works
suggest incorporating fake textual reviews to strengthen the profiles; yet, the
poor quality of the reviews largely undermines the attack effectiveness and
imperceptibility under the practical setting.
  To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose to enhance the
quality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities
of multimodal foundation models. To this end, we introduce a demonstration
retrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the navie
ICL. Specifically, we propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to
generate high-quality fake user profiles, which can gain insights into the
robustness of RSs. The profiles are generated by a jailbreaker and
collaboratively optimized on an instructional agent and a guardian to improve
the attack transferability and imperceptibility. Comprehensive experiments on
various real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAN achieves the
state-of-the-art poisoning attack performance.

### [320] [IPIGuard: A Novel Tool Dependency Graph-Based Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15310)
*Hengyu An,Jinghuai Zhang,Tianyu Du,Chunyi Zhou,Qingming Li,Tao Lin,Shouling Ji*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses threats from Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) in LLM agents using tools and introduces IPIGuard, a model based on Tool Dependency Graphs to improve security against malicious tool invocations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the vulnerabilities in LLM agents when interacting with untrusted data sources, specifically addressing security risks posed by Indirect Prompt Injection.

Method: The proposed method, IPIGuard, uses a Tool Dependency Graph (TDG) to separate action planning from external data interactions, reducing the risk of unintended tool invocations.

Result: Experiments using the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard enhances robustness against IPI attacks while maintaining effectiveness in task execution.

Conclusion: IPIGuard provides a more secure framework for task execution in LLM agents, ensuring safer operations in environments with untrusted data sources.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are widely deployed in real-world
applications, where they leverage tools to retrieve and manipulate external
data for complex tasks. However, when interacting with untrusted data sources
(e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain
injected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to
malicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI).
Existing defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary
detection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness,
they fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security,
which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents
still retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable
to stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the
model. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel
defensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents'
task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph
(TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external
data, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by
injected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks.
Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior
balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the
development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.

### [321] [MCPTox: A Benchmark for Tool Poisoning Attack on Real-World MCP Servers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14925)
*Zhiqiang Wang,Yichao Gao,Yanting Wang,Suyuan Liu,Haifeng Sun,Haoran Cheng,Guanquan Shi,Haohua Du,Xiangyang Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces MCPTox, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate AI agent vulnerability to "Tool Poisoning" within the Model Context Protocol (MCP) setting, using real-world MCP servers and tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the novel attack surfaces created by MCP's interaction with untrusted external tools, particularly the lack of systematic evaluation for "Tool Poisoning" vulnerabilities.

Method: The authors build MCPTox, using 45 MCP servers and 353 tools, and design 1312 malicious test cases covering 10 risk categories using three attack templates.

Result: Testing on 20 LLM agents reveals a high vulnerability to Tool Poisoning, with an attack success rate of up to 72.8%, and existing safety features proving largely ineffective.

Conclusion: The findings highlight critical safety flaws in existing AI systems and provide a benchmark (MCPTox) to mitigate these vulnerabilities, aiding the development of safer AI agents.

Abstract: By providing a standardized interface for LLM agents to interact with
external tools, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is quickly becoming a
cornerstone of the modern autonomous agent ecosystem. However, it creates novel
attack surfaces due to untrusted external tools. While prior work has focused
on attacks injected through external tool outputs, we investigate a more
fundamental vulnerability: Tool Poisoning, where malicious instructions are
embedded within a tool's metadata without execution. To date, this threat has
been primarily demonstrated through isolated cases, lacking a systematic,
large-scale evaluation.
  We introduce MCPTox, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate agent
robustness against Tool Poisoning in realistic MCP settings. MCPTox is
constructed upon 45 live, real-world MCP servers and 353 authentic tools. To
achieve this, we design three distinct attack templates to generate a
comprehensive suite of 1312 malicious test cases by few-shot learning, covering
10 categories of potential risks. Our evaluation on 20 prominent LLM agents
setting reveals a widespread vulnerability to Tool Poisoning, with o1-mini,
achieving an attack success rate of 72.8\%. We find that more capable models
are often more susceptible, as the attack exploits their superior
instruction-following abilities. Finally, the failure case analysis reveals
that agents rarely refuse these attacks, with the highest refused rate
(Claude-3.7-Sonnet) less than 3\%, demonstrating that existing safety alignment
is ineffective against malicious actions that use legitimate tools for
unauthorized operation. Our findings create a crucial empirical baseline for
understanding and mitigating this widespread threat, and we release MCPTox for
the development of verifiably safer AI agents. Our dataset is available at an
anonymized repository: \textit{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AAAI26-7C02}.

*Ehssan Mousavipour,Andrey Dimanchev,Majid Ghaderi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: NetSight is a supervised framework for anomaly detection in network data that adapts to distribution shifts online, without requiring manual labeling, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by distribution shifts in data, which disrupt the performance of anomaly detection systems. Current methods require expensive labeling or clean data and are impractical for real-world scenarios.

Method: NetSight employs a pseudo-labeling technique to eliminate manual intervention and a knowledge distillation-based strategy to adapt to distribution shifts while preventing catastrophic forgetting.

Result: NetSight outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving F1-scores by up to 11.72% on three long-term network datasets, proving its effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: NetSight is a practical and effective solution for anomaly detection in dynamic networks, enabling continuous adaptation to distribution shifts without manual labeling.

Abstract: Distribution shift, a change in the statistical properties of data over time,
poses a critical challenge for deep learning anomaly detection systems.
Existing anomaly detection systems often struggle to adapt to these shifts.
Specifically, systems based on supervised learning require costly manual
labeling, while those based on unsupervised learning rely on clean data, which
is difficult to obtain, for shift adaptation. Both of these requirements are
challenging to meet in practice. In this paper, we introduce NetSight, a
framework for supervised anomaly detection in network data that continually
detects and adapts to distribution shifts in an online manner. NetSight
eliminates manual intervention through a novel pseudo-labeling technique and
uses a knowledge distillation-based adaptation strategy to prevent catastrophic
forgetting. Evaluated on three long-term network datasets, NetSight
demonstrates superior adaptation performance compared to state-of-the-art
methods that rely on manual labeling, achieving F1-score improvements of up to
11.72%. This proves its robustness and effectiveness in dynamic networks that
experience distribution shifts over time.

### [323] [BadFU: Backdoor Federated Learning through Adversarial Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15541)
*Bingguang Lu,Hongsheng Hu,Yuantian Miao,Shaleeza Sohail,Chaoxiang He,Shuo Wang,Xiao Chen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative learning without sharing local data, but integrating machine unlearning into FL poses security risks. The paper introduces BadFU, a backdoor attack exploiting the unlearning process to inject backdoors into models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing importance of machine unlearning in the federated learning context due to privacy, legal, and ethical demands, while highlighting vulnerabilities associated with integrating unlearning.

Method: BadFU attack strategy involves using malicious clients to inject backdoors by combining normal training with camouflage sample injections and later triggering unlearning requests to alter the global model.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the BadFU attack under diverse federated learning frameworks and unlearning strategies.

Conclusion: The study exposes critical vulnerabilities in current federated unlearning practices, emphasizing the need for more secure and robust mechanisms in federated learning.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has been widely adopted as a decentralized training
paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared model
without exposing their local data. As concerns over data privacy and regulatory
compliance grow, machine unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of
specific data from trained models, has become increasingly important in the
federated setting to meet legal, ethical, or user-driven demands. However,
integrating unlearning into FL introduces new challenges and raises largely
unexplored security risks. In particular, adversaries may exploit the
unlearning process to compromise the integrity of the global model. In this
paper, we present the first backdoor attack in the context of federated
unlearning, demonstrating that an adversary can inject backdoors into the
global model through seemingly legitimate unlearning requests. Specifically, we
propose BadFU, an attack strategy where a malicious client uses both backdoor
and camouflage samples to train the global model normally during the federated
training process. Once the client requests unlearning of the camouflage
samples, the global model transitions into a backdoored state. Extensive
experiments under various FL frameworks and unlearning strategies validate the
effectiveness of BadFU, revealing a critical vulnerability in current federated
unlearning practices and underscoring the urgent need for more secure and
robust federated unlearning mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving active learning techniques in quantum chemical predictions by leveraging fidelity trade-offs between computational accuracy and cost.

Method: Introducing a novel uncertainty quantification approach informed by low-fidelity computations to optimize active learning in quantum chemistry applications.

Result: The study demonstrates better empirical accuracy and reduced iterations for models utilizing the proposed method, compared to existing alternatives, through computational experiments.

Conclusion: Low-fidelity informed uncertainty quantification enhances active learning workflows for quantum chemical predictions, providing efficient and accurate outcomes while benchmarking fidelity choices for optimization.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is an important scheme in active learning
techniques, including applications in predicting quantum chemical properties.
In quantum chemical calculations, there exists the notion of a fidelity, a less

TL;DR: The paper discusses the importance of considering strategic reasoning in AI testing and evaluation, and highlights game-theoretic analysis as a useful tool for improving evaluation design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure that AI testing and evaluation reflect realistic deployment behavior, including the potential for AI systems to reason strategically.

Method: The authors use examples from existing AI systems, review relevant research, and conduct formal game-theoretic analysis of a stylized evaluation scenario.

Result: The paper presents evidence supporting the value of game-theoretic methods for informing AI evaluation design.

Conclusion: Evaluations for AI systems must consider strategic reasoning, and game-theoretic approaches offer a valuable framework for enhancing evaluation processes.

Abstract: This position paper argues for two claims regarding AI testing and
evaluation. First, to remain informative about deployment behaviour,
evaluations need account for the possibility that AI systems understand their
circumstances and reason strategically. Second, game-theoretic analysis can
inform evaluation design by formalising and scrutinising the reasoning in
evaluation-based safety cases. Drawing on examples from existing AI systems, a
review of relevant research, and formal strategic analysis of a stylised

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for incorporating radiologists' confidence levels into AI model training for lung ultrasound (LUS) segmentation, leading to better performance in clinical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lung ultrasound imaging lacks consistent annotations due to inter-observer variability and subjective interpretation, necessitating a framework that accounts for label uncertainty.

Method: The authors propose a data annotation protocol incorporating per-pixel confidence values from radiologists and demonstrate how using these confidence levels during training improves segmentation and downstream tasks. A 60% confidence threshold is identified as optimal for binarizing labels.

Result: Incorporating confidence levels resulted in improved segmentation quality, better performance in predicting downstream tasks like S/F ratio estimation, and 30-day readmission forecasting. Specifically, higher confidence thresholds outperformed naive methods.

Conclusion: Label confidence is a critical signal that can enhance AI reliability and clinical utility when effectively leveraged in medical imaging applications.

Abstract: In medical imaging, inter-observer variability among radiologists often
introduces label uncertainty, particularly in modalities where visual
interpretation is subjective. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it
frequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly
discernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for
experienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both
labeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence
values. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a
data annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in
each labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in
real-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence
values during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More
importantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into
better performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically,
estimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and
predicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many
methods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a
simple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%)
confidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better
than a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very
confident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates
the impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only
segmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results
suggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly
leveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI
in medical imaging.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robust tongue image segmentation model (TOM) using multi-teacher knowledge distillation and diffusion-based data augmentation, achieving high performance and reducing parameter size significantly. It is publicly available as an online/offline tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing tongue image segmentation tools, which hinder the accuracy of intelligent tongue diagnosis systems and are not user-friendly, especially for TCM practitioners and researchers without programming expertise.

Method: The authors utilized a multi-teacher knowledge distillation approach combined with a novel diffusion-based data augmentation method to develop a more compact and generalizable segmentation model. They reduced the model's parameters by 96.6% without sacrificing performance and packaged the tool for accessible deployment.

Result: The resulting student model achieved 95.22% mIoU in segmentation performance despite a significant reduction in parameter count. Additionally, a case study demonstrated that segmented tongue patches improved TCM constitution classification performance and interpretability.

Conclusion: The paper provides a high-performing and compact tongue image segmentation tool that is both open-source and user-friendly. This represents a significant contribution to TCM research and intelligent tongue diagnosis systems.

Abstract: Tongue imaging serves as a valuable diagnostic tool, particularly in
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The quality of tongue surface segmentation
significantly affects the accuracy of tongue image classification and
subsequent diagnosis in intelligent tongue diagnosis systems. However, existing
research on tongue image segmentation faces notable limitations, and there is a
lack of robust and user-friendly segmentation tools. This paper proposes a
tongue image segmentation model (TOM) based on multi-teacher knowledge
distillation. By incorporating a novel diffusion-based data augmentation
method, we enhanced the generalization ability of the segmentation model while
reducing its parameter size. Notably, after reducing the parameter count by
96.6% compared to the teacher models, the student model still achieves an
impressive segmentation performance of 95.22% mIoU. Furthermore, we packaged
and deployed the trained model as both an online and offline segmentation tool
(available at https://itongue.cn/), allowing TCM practitioners and researchers
to use it without any programming experience. We also present a case study on
TCM constitution classification using segmented tongue patches. Experimental
results demonstrate that training with tongue patches yields higher
classification performance and better interpretability than original tongue
images. To our knowledge, this is the first open-source and freely available
tongue image segmentation tool.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional lossy compression and streaming technologies do not suit the unique asynchronous pixel samples recorded by neuromorphic "event" sensors, which require new solutions for efficient transmission.

Method: The authors analyze current event-based video systems, address issues in their scalable event streaming work, and design a low-latency streaming format leveraging Media Over QUIC features.

Result: A novel event streaming format based on Media Over QUIC is proposed to address latency and scalability concerns in transmitting event-based video data.

Conclusion: The new streaming protocol has the potential to advance event-based video systems by overcoming key transmission challenges and enhancing low-latency performance.

Abstract: Lossy compression and rate-adaptive streaming are a mainstay in traditional
video steams. However, a new class of neuromorphic ``event'' sensors records
video with asynchronous pixel samples rather than image frames. These sensors
are designed for computer vision applications, rather than human video
consumption. Until now, researchers have focused their efforts primarily on
application development, ignoring the crucial problem of data transmission. We
survey the landscape of event-based video systems, discuss the technical issues
with our recent scalable event streaming work, and propose a new low-latency
event streaming format based on the latest additions to the Media Over QUIC
protocol draft.

*Jeonghyun Noh,Hyun-Jic Oh,Byungju Chae,Won-Ki Jeong*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a zero-shot 3D CT super-resolution (SR) method that leverages diffusion-generated 2D X-ray priors to enhance detail recovery and avoid relying on paired datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of obtaining high-resolution CT from low-resolution inputs without relying on large-scale paired datasets, while improving anatomical detail recovery.

Method: The approach trains a diffusion model on large-scale 2D X-ray data, uses adaptive sampling for generating HR projections, and employs 3D Gaussian splatting with negative alpha blending (NAB-GS) for reconstructing enhanced 3D CT volumes.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior quantitative and qualitative performance in 3D CT super-resolution on two benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses limitations of zero-shot SR methods by leveraging external 2D X-ray priors and novel reconstruction techniques, providing a robust solution for HR CT reconstruction.

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is widely used in clinical diagnosis, but acquiring
high-resolution (HR) CT is limited by radiation exposure risks. Deep
learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have been studied to reconstruct
HR from low-resolution (LR) inputs. While supervised SR approaches have shown
promising results, they require large-scale paired LR-HR volume datasets that
are often unavailable. In contrast, zero-shot methods alleviate the need for
paired data by using only a single LR input, but typically struggle to recover
fine anatomical details due to limited internal information. To overcome these,
we propose a novel zero-shot 3D CT SR framework that leverages upsampled 2D
X-ray projection priors generated by a diffusion model. Exploiting the
abundance of HR 2D X-ray data, we train a diffusion model on large-scale 2D
X-ray projection and introduce a per-projection adaptive sampling strategy. It
selects the generative process for each projection, thus providing HR
projections as strong external priors for 3D CT reconstruction. These
projections serve as inputs to 3D Gaussian splatting for reconstructing a 3D CT
volume. Furthermore, we propose negative alpha blending (NAB-GS) that allows
negative values in Gaussian density representation. NAB-GS enables residual
learning between LR and diffusion-based projections, thereby enhancing
high-frequency structure reconstruction. Experiments on two datasets show that
our method achieves superior quantitative and qualitative results for 3D CT SR.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel unsupervised anomaly detection method in digital pathology using a vision-language and diffusion model-driven approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised learning models in digital pathology require extensively annotated datasets, which are scarce. This limitation motivates the exploration of unsupervised anomaly detection methods that do not rely heavily on annotations, addressing this scarcity while still accurately identifying abnormalities.

Method: The paper integrates denoising diffusion probabilistic models with vision-language models to facilitate anomaly detection in digital pathology. Keywords related to normal tissue are used as prompts to guide image reconstruction, distinguishing normal tissue from abnormalities.

Result: The proposed method was tested on a gastric lymph node dataset from a local hospital. Its generalization ability was further evaluated under domain shift using a public breast lymph node dataset, showcasing promising results in detecting anomalies.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates the potential of combining diffusion models and vision-language models for unsupervised anomaly detection across different organ datasets in digital pathology, mitigating the need for extensively annotated datasets.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is an emerging approach in digital pathology for its
ability to efficiently and effectively utilize data for disease diagnosis.
While supervised learning approaches deliver high accuracy, they rely on
extensively annotated datasets, suffering from data scarcity in digital
pathology. Unsupervised anomaly detection, however, offers a viable alternative
by identifying deviations from normal tissue distributions without requiring
exhaustive annotations. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have
gained popularity in unsupervised anomaly detection, achieving promising
performance in both natural and medical imaging datasets. Building on this, we
incorporate a vision-language model with a diffusion model for unsupervised
anomaly detection in digital pathology, utilizing histopathology prompts during
reconstruction. Our approach employs a set of pathology-related keywords
associated with normal tissues to guide the reconstruction process,
facilitating the differentiation between normal and abnormal tissues. To
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on a
gastric lymph node dataset from a local hospital and assess its generalization
ability under domain shift using a public breast lymph node dataset. The
experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed method for
unsupervised anomaly detection across various organs in digital pathology.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study introduces DoSReMC, a batch normalization adaptation framework to improve cross-domain generalization in mammography classification using CNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts in mammography data make deep learning models less effective, creating challenges for their safe and equitable deployment in clinical settings.

Method: The paper proposes fine-tuning only batch normalization and fully connected layers of CNNs, while preserving convolutional filters, paired with adversarial training.

Result: Experiments using three large-scale datasets showed batch normalization layers are key to domain dependence and DoSReMC enhances generalization performance.

Conclusion: DoSReMC can improve the robustness and adaptability of AI-driven mammography classification systems across varied clinical environments.

Abstract: Numerous deep learning-based solutions have been developed for the automatic
recognition of breast cancer using mammography images. However, their
performance often declines when applied to data from different domains,
primarily due to domain shift - the variation in data distributions between
source and target domains. This performance drop limits the safe and equitable
deployment of AI in real-world clinical settings. In this study, we present
DoSReMC (Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification), a batch
normalization (BN) adaptation framework designed to enhance cross-domain
generalization without retraining the entire model. Using three large-scale
full-field digital mammography (FFDM) datasets - including HCTP, a newly
introduced, pathologically confirmed in-house dataset - we conduct a systematic
cross-domain evaluation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our results
demonstrate that BN layers are a primary source of domain dependence: they
perform effectively when training and testing occur within the same domain, and
they significantly impair model generalization under domain shift. DoSReMC
addresses this limitation by fine-tuning only the BN and fully connected (FC)
layers, while preserving pretrained convolutional filters. We further integrate
this targeted adaptation with an adversarial training scheme, yielding
additional improvements in cross-domain generalizability. DoSReMC can be
readily incorporated into existing AI pipelines and applied across diverse
clinical environments, providing a practical pathway toward more robust and
generalizable mammography classification systems.

### [334] [Deep Equilibrium Convolutional Sparse Coding for Hyperspectral Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15553)
*Jin Ye,Jingran Wang,Fengchao Xiong,Jingzhou Chen,Yuntao Qian*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Deep Equilibrium Convolutional Sparse Coding (DECSC) framework for hyperspectral image denoising, leveraging physical consistency, spatial correlations, and self-similarities using convolutional and transformer-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral images are crucial for remote sensing but are often affected by complex noise patterns. Current denoising methods lack guarantees in convergence and optimization consistency, prompting the need for enhanced frameworks.

Method: Under the Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) framework, the paper proposes a DECSC model that unifies 2D convolutional sparse representations for global spatial consistency and 3D convolutional representations for local details. Additionally, a transformer block and a detail enhancement module address nonlocal self-similarities and detail preservation respectively.

Result: The DECSC model demonstrated superior denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: By leveraging the DEQ framework and a unified approach for spatial-spectral correlations, the DECSC framework efficiently addresses HSI denoising challenges and establishes a new benchmark in denoising performance.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) play a crucial role in remote sensing but are
often degraded by complex noise patterns. Ensuring the physical property of the
denoised HSIs is vital for robust HSI denoising, giving the rise of deep
unfolding-based methods. However, these methods map the optimization of a
physical model to a learnable network with a predefined depth, which lacks
convergence guarantees. In contrast, Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) models treat the
hidden layers of deep networks as the solution to a fixed-point problem and
models them as infinite-depth networks, naturally consistent with the
optimization. Under the framework of DEQ, we propose a Deep Equilibrium
Convolutional Sparse Coding (DECSC) framework that unifies local
spatial-spectral correlations, nonlocal spatial self-similarities, and global
spatial consistency for robust HSI denoising. Within the convolutional sparse
coding (CSC) framework, we enforce shared 2D convolutional sparse
representation to ensure global spatial consistency across bands, while
unshared 3D convolutional sparse representation captures local spatial-spectral
details. To further exploit nonlocal self-similarities, a transformer block is
embedded after the 2D CSC. Additionally, a detail enhancement module is
integrated with the 3D CSC to promote image detail preservation. We formulate
the proximal gradient descent of the CSC model as a fixed-point problem and
transform the iterative updates into a learnable network architecture within
the framework of DEQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our DECSC method
achieves superior denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [335] [Are Virtual DES Images a Valid Alternative to the Real Ones?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15594)
*Ana C. Perre,Luís A. Alexandre,Luís C. Freire*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study explores generating dual-energy subtracted (DES) mammography images using low-energy (LE) mammography images through deep learning methods, aiming to reduce radiation exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce radiation exposure by developing methods for generating DES images from LE images in contrast-enhanced spectral mammography.

Method: Three deep learning models—pre-trained U-Net, an end-to-end trained U-Net, and a CycleGAN—were used to generate virtual DES images, followed by evaluation of their impact on lesion classification.

Result: The pre-trained U-Net demonstrated the best performance for virtual DES image generation with an F1 score of 85.59%, compared to 90.35% for real DES images.

Conclusion: Virtual DES image generation shows promise despite a performance gap relative to real DES images. Refinement of the techniques may lead to clinically viable alternatives to real DES imaging.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is an imaging modality that
provides two types of images, commonly known as low-energy (LE) and dual-energy
subtracted (DES) images. In many domains, particularly in medicine, the
emergence of image-to-image translation techniques has enabled the artificial
generation of images using other images as input. Within CESM, applying such
techniques to generate DES images from LE images could be highly beneficial,
potentially reducing patient exposure to radiation associated with high-energy
image acquisition. In this study, we investigated three models for the
artificial generation of DES images (virtual DES): a pre-trained U-Net model, a
U-Net trained end-to-end model, and a CycleGAN model. We also performed a
series of experiments to assess the impact of using virtual DES images on the
classification of CESM examinations into malignant and non-malignant
categories. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of
virtual DES images on CESM lesion classification. The results demonstrate that
the best performance was achieved with the pre-trained U-Net model, yielding an
F1 score of 85.59% when using the virtual DES images, compared to 90.35% with
the real DES images. This discrepancy likely results from the additional
diagnostic information in real DES images, which contributes to a higher
classification accuracy. Nevertheless, the potential for virtual DES image
generation is considerable and future advancements may narrow this performance
gap to a level where exclusive reliance on virtual DES images becomes
clinically viable.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for super-resolution in 4D Flow MRI, addressing near-wall velocity recovery and low SNR, and highlights the importance of selecting appropriate adversarial strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in 4D Flow MRI caused by low spatial resolution and noise, particularly for near-wall velocity measurements.

Method: GAN-based super-resolution was tested on synthetic images derived from patient-specific cerebrovascular models. Three adversarial loss functions—Vanilla, Relativistic, and Wasserstein—were evaluated for their performance and stability.

Result: The Wasserstein GAN showed superior stability and improved recovery of near-wall velocities (vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 9.6%) and outperformed the generator-only baseline in low-SNR scenarios.

Conclusion: The findings reveal the potential of GAN-based super-resolution to enhance 4D Flow MRI, but emphasize the critical role of optimizing adversarial loss strategies for stable performance.

Abstract: 4D Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (4D Flow MRI) enables non-invasive
quantification of blood flow and hemodynamic parameters. However, its clinical
application is limited by low spatial resolution and noise, particularly
affecting near-wall velocity measurements. Machine learning-based
super-resolution has shown promise in addressing these limitations, but
challenges remain, not least in recovering near-wall velocities. Generative
adversarial networks (GANs) offer a compelling solution, having demonstrated
strong capabilities in restoring sharp boundaries in non-medical
super-resolution tasks. Yet, their application in 4D Flow MRI remains
unexplored, with implementation challenged by known issues such as training
instability and non-convergence. In this study, we investigate GAN-based
super-resolution in 4D Flow MRI. Training and validation were conducted using
patient-specific cerebrovascular in-silico models, converted into synthetic
images via an MR-true reconstruction pipeline. A dedicated GAN architecture was
implemented and evaluated across three adversarial loss functions: Vanilla,
Relativistic, and Wasserstein. Our results demonstrate that the proposed GAN
improved near-wall velocity recovery compared to a non-adversarial reference
(vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 9.6%); however, that implementation specifics are critical
for stable network training. While Vanilla and Relativistic GANs proved
unstable compared to generator-only training (vNRMSE: 8.1% and 7.8% vs. 7.2%),
a Wasserstein GAN demonstrated optimal stability and incremental improvement
(vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 7.2%). The Wasserstein GAN further outperformed the
generator-only baseline at low SNR (vNRMSE: 8.7% vs. 10.7%). These findings
highlight the potential of GAN-based super-resolution in enhancing 4D Flow MRI,
particularly in challenging cerebrovascular regions, while emphasizing the need
for careful selection of adversarial strategies.

### [337] [Hessian-based lightweight neural network for brain vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15660)
*Alexandra Bernadotte,Elfimov Nikita,Mikhail Shutov,Ivan Menshikov*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HessNet, a lightweight neural network designed for accurate brain vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) images, and provides a newly annotated public dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate vessel segmentation in brain MRA is crucial for surgeries like aneurysm repair, but current methods (manual and classical) lack precision. Despite the potential of neural networks, their application is hindered by the lack of annotated datasets.

Method: The paper proposes HessNet, a semi-supervised lightweight neural network with only 6000 parameters, leveraging Hessian matrices. HessNet enables 3D segmentation of tubular structures with high accuracy, even on minimal training data.

Result: HessNet achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in vessel segmentation and allowed for the semi-manual annotation of 200 brain MRA images from the IXI dataset. These annotations were validated by experts and are now publicly available.

Conclusion: HessNet provides an efficient, resource-light solution for brain vessel segmentation and addresses the lack of annotated MRA datasets, offering a useful tool for both research and clinical application.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of blood vessels in brain magnetic resonance
angiography (MRA) is essential for successful surgical procedures, such as
aneurysm repair or bypass surgery. Currently, annotation is primarily performed
through manual segmentation or classical methods, such as the Frangi filter,
which often lack sufficient accuracy. Neural networks have emerged as powerful
tools for medical image segmentation, but their development depends on
well-annotated training datasets. However, there is a notable lack of publicly
available MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning lightweight
neural network with Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of complex
structures such as tubular structures, which we named HessNet. The solution is
a Hessian-based neural network with only 6000 parameters. HessNet can run on
the CPU and significantly reduces the resource requirements for training neural
networks. The accuracy of vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset
reaches state-of-the-art results. It helps us create a large, semi-manually
annotated brain vessel dataset of brain MRA images based on the IXI dataset
(annotated 200 images). Annotation was performed by three experts under the
supervision of three neurovascular surgeons after applying HessNet. It provides
high accuracy of vessel segmentation and allows experts to focus only on the
most complex important cases. The dataset is available at
https://git.scinalytics.com/terilat/VesselDatasetPartly.

*Paul Fischer,Jan Nikolas Morshuis,Thomas Küstner,Christian Baumgartner*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents a dynamic framework for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that adapts scan times based on patient-specific needs using uncertainty-aware modeling, optimizing efficiency and diagnostic confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MRI protocols are limited by static acceleration factors, leading to either excessively long scans or suboptimal image quality, and they ignore the uncertainty inherent in undersampled data reconstructions.

Method: The proposed method uses a probabilistic reconstruction model to estimate image uncertainties and incorporates conformal prediction to generate calibrated confidence intervals for clinical metrics of interest. An iterative acquisition process ensures that scans meet user-defined precision targets before automatically terminating.

Result: The framework was validated on knee and cardiac MRI datasets, showing reduced scan times compared to fixed protocols while ensuring statistically rigorous guarantees on image precision.

Conclusion: This system represents a significant advance in personalized MRI by enabling adaptive, patient-specific acquisitions that optimize both diagnostic reliability and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers unparalleled soft-tissue contrast but
is fundamentally limited by long acquisition times. While deep learning-based
accelerated MRI can dramatically shorten scan times, the reconstruction from
undersampled data introduces ambiguity resulting from an ill-posed problem with
infinitely many possible solutions that propagates to downstream clinical
tasks. This uncertainty is usually ignored during the acquisition process as
acceleration factors are often fixed a priori, resulting in scans that are
either unnecessarily long or of insufficient quality for a given clinical
endpoint. This work introduces a dynamic, uncertainty-aware acquisition
framework that adjusts scan time on a per-subject basis. Our method leverages a
probabilistic reconstruction model to estimate image uncertainty, which is then
propagated through a full analysis pipeline to a quantitative metric of
interest (e.g., patellar cartilage volume or cardiac ejection fraction). We use
conformal prediction to transform this uncertainty into a rigorous, calibrated
confidence interval for the metric. During acquisition, the system iteratively
samples k-space, updates the reconstruction, and evaluates the confidence
interval. The scan terminates automatically once the uncertainty meets a
user-predefined precision target. We validate our framework on both knee and
cardiac MRI datasets. Our results demonstrate that this adaptive approach
reduces scan times compared to fixed protocols while providing formal
statistical guarantees on the precision of the final image. This framework
moves beyond fixed acceleration factors, enabling patient-specific acquisitions
that balance scan efficiency with diagnostic confidence, a critical step
towards personalized and resource-efficient MRI.

*Aakash Khandelwal,Ranjan Mukherjee*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The study addresses the challenge of achieving vertical propeller motion of a devil-stick using impulsive forces and introduces a new control concept, DVHC, for stabilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of controlling underactuated robotic systems, specifically the propeller motion of a devil-stick in the vertical plane, had not been addressed before. This study seeks innovative methods to solve it.

Method: The researchers introduced the concept of discrete virtual holonomic constraints (DVHC) to establish control conditions, developed discrete zero dynamics (DZD) for stability analysis, and designed both a DVHC and an orbit stabilizing controller.

Result: Simulations confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed DVHC-based controllers and their ability to stabilize and design desired trajectories for the devil-stick's motion.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates that DVHC and related control techniques are effective for solving the underactuated motion problem of the devil-stick, paving the way for advancements in robotic juggling dynamics.

Abstract: The control problem of realizing propeller motion of a devil-stick in the
vertical plane using impulsive forces applied normal to the stick is
considered. This problem is an example of underactuated robotic juggling and
has not been considered in the literature before. Inspired by virtual holonomic
constraints, the concept of discrete virtual holonomic constraints (DVHC) is
introduced for the first time to solve this orbital stabilization problem. At
the discrete instants when impulsive inputs are applied, the location of the
center-of-mass of the devil-stick is specified in terms of its orientation
angle. This yields the discrete zero dynamics (DZD), which provides conditions
for stable propeller motion. In the limiting case, when the rotation angle
between successive applications of impulsive inputs is chosen to be arbitrarily
small, the problem reduces to that of propeller motion under continuous
forcing. A controller that enforces the DVHC, and an orbit stabilizing
controller based on the impulse controlled Poincar\'e map approach are
presented. The efficacy of the approach to trajectory design and stabilization
is validated through simulations.

*Tobias Sebastian Finn,Marc Bocquet,Pierre Rampal,Charlotte Durand,Flavia Porro,Alban Farchi,Alberto Carrassi*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents GenSIM, a generative AI model for predicting Arctic sea ice dynamics with improved efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately modeling sea ice dynamics is crucial but computationally demanding in Earth system models.

Method: GenSIM, an AI-based model, predicts sea ice properties like concentration, thickness, and drift using generative techniques, trained on simulation data.

Result: GenSIM achieves accurate sea ice predictions over 12 hours, reproduces observed dynamics, and identifies long-term trends with computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Generative models like GenSIM hold promise for efficient and accurate climate modeling, capturing hidden physics and generalizing to unseen states.

Abstract: Sea ice is governed by highly complex, scale-invariant, and anisotropic
processes that are challenging to represent in Earth system models. While
advanced numerical models have improved our understanding of the sea-ice
dynamics, their computational costs often limit their application in ensemble
forecasting and climate simulations. Here, we introduce GenSIM, the first
generative AI-based pan-Arctic model that predicts the evolution of all
relevant key properties, including concentration, thickness, and drift, in a
12-hour window with improved accuracy over deterministic predictions and high
computational efficiency, while remaining physically consistent. Trained on a
long simulation from a state-of-the-art sea-ice--ocean system, GenSIM robustly
reproduces statistics as observed in numerical models and observations,
exhibiting brittle-like short-term dynamics while also depicting the long-term
sea-ice decline. Driven solely by atmospheric forcings, we attribute GenSIM's
emergent extrapolation capabilities to patterns that reflect the long-term
impact of the ocean: it seemingly has learned an internal ocean emulator. This
ability to infer slowly evolving climate-relevant dynamics from short-term
predictions underlines the large potential of generative models to generalise
for unseen climates and to encode hidden physics.

*Zhongwei Zhang,Erich Fischer,Jakob Zscheischler,Sebastian Engelke*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: AI models are advancing in weather forecasting but still lag behind traditional numerical models like HRES when predicting record-breaking weather extremes. AI models show higher errors, underestimate extreme events, and may struggle in high-stakes applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to evaluate whether AI-based weather models can reliably forecast unprecedented extreme weather events, which are crucial in a rapidly warming climate.

Method: Comparison of forecasting performance between AI models (GraphCast, Pangu-Weather, Fuxi) and the numerical HRES model, focusing on their ability to predict record-breaking weather extremes such as heat, cold, and wind.

Result: The HRES model outperforms AI models in accuracy for extreme weather events. AI models underestimate the frequency and intensity of extremes, with growing errors for record exceedance.

Conclusion: Current AI weather models are limited in extrapolating beyond their training data and forecasting high-impact extreme events. Further development and validation are necessary before their use in critical applications like disaster management.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models are revolutionizing weather
forecasting and have surpassed leading numerical weather prediction systems on
various benchmark tasks. However, their ability to extrapolate and reliably
forecast unprecedented extreme events remains unclear. Here, we show that for
record-breaking weather extremes, the numerical model High RESolution forecast
(HRES) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts still
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AI models GraphCast, GraphCast
operational, Pangu-Weather, Pangu-Weather operational, and Fuxi. We demonstrate
that forecast errors in AI models are consistently larger for record-breaking
heat, cold, and wind than in HRES across nearly all lead times. We further find
that the examined AI models tend to underestimate both the frequency and
intensity of record-breaking events, and they underpredict hot records and
overestimate cold records with growing errors for larger record exceedance. Our
findings underscore the current limitations of AI weather models in
extrapolating beyond their training domain and in forecasting the potentially
most impactful record-breaking weather events that are particularly frequent in
a rapidly warming climate. Further rigorous verification and model development
is needed before these models can be solely relied upon for high-stakes
applications such as early warning systems and disaster management.

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel method (adversarial random forests, ARF) for generating synthetic epidemiological data efficiently and with high quality, aiming to reproduce key findings from epidemiological research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often produce low-quality synthetic data, are computationally demanding, and are difficult for non-experts to use. Evaluation strategies also lack effective measures of statistical utility and reliability in reproducing key epidemiological findings.

Method: The study introduces adversarial random forests (ARF) for synthesizing tabular epidemiological data. It evaluates the method's performance by replicating statistical analyses from six epidemiological studies and comparing synthetic data results with original ones.

Result: The synthetic data generated using ARF closely matched the original findings across multiple studies, showing high reproducibility even under challenging conditions like low sample size-to-dimensionality ratios.

Conclusion: ARF demonstrated effectiveness, efficiency, and quality in synthetic data generation, with results aligning closely with original findings. Reducing dimensional complexity further improved synthesis quality and stability, making ARF promising for epidemiological applications.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence for synthetic data generation holds
substantial potential to address practical challenges in epidemiology. However,
many current methods suffer from limited quality, high computational demands,
and complexity for non-experts. Furthermore, common evaluation strategies for
synthetic data often fail to directly reflect statistical utility. Against this
background, a critical underexplored question is whether synthetic data can
reliably reproduce key findings from epidemiological research. We propose the
use of adversarial random forests (ARF) as an efficient and convenient method
for synthesizing tabular epidemiological data. To evaluate its performance, we
replicated statistical analyses from six epidemiological publications and
compared original with synthetic results. These publications cover blood
pressure, anthropometry, myocardial infarction, accelerometry, loneliness, and
diabetes, based on data from the German National Cohort (NAKO
Gesundheitsstudie), the Bremen STEMI Registry U45 Study, and the Guelph Family
Health Study. Additionally, we assessed the impact of dimensionality and
variable complexity on synthesis quality by limiting datasets to variables
relevant for individual analyses, including necessary derivations. Across all
replicated original studies, results from multiple synthetic data replications
consistently aligned with original findings. Even for datasets with relatively
low sample size-to-dimensionality ratios, the replication outcomes closely
matched the original results across various descriptive and inferential
analyses. Reducing dimensionality and pre-deriving variables further enhanced
both quality and stability of the results.

Motivation: To improve the prediction accuracy of glaucoma progression risk in PACG patients by integrating structural and functional parameters.

Method: The study used AI-segmented OCT-derived ONH structural features and sector-based VF functional sensitivities, combined in machine learning models, to classify progression rates.

Result: The Random Forest model integrating structural and functional data achieved the best performance, with an AUC of 0.87. Key predictors were primarily ONH structural features.

Conclusion: Integrating structural and functional data significantly enhances progression risk classification in PACG, emphasizing the importance of ONH morphology in disease monitoring.

Abstract: Purpose: To classify eyes as slow or fast glaucoma progressors in patients
with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) using an integrated approach
combining optic nerve head (ONH) structural features and sector-based visual
field (VF) functional parameters. Methods: PACG patients with >5 reliable VF
tests over >5 years were included. Progression was assessed in Zeiss Forum,
with baseline VF within six months of OCT. Fast progression was VFI decline
<-2.0% per year; slow progression >-2.0% per year. OCT volumes were
AI-segmented to extract 31 ONH parameters. The Glaucoma Hemifield Test defined
five regions per hemifield, aligned with RNFL distribution. Mean sensitivity
per region was combined with structural parameters to train ML classifiers.
Multiple models were tested, and SHAP identified key predictors. Main outcome
measures: Classification of slow versus fast progressors using combined
structural and functional data. Results: We analyzed 451 eyes from 299
patients. Mean VFI progression was -0.92% per year; 369 eyes progressed slowly
and 82 rapidly. The Random Forest model combining structural and functional
features achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.87, 2000 Monte Carlo
iterations). SHAP identified six key predictors: inferior MRW, inferior and
inferior-temporal RNFL thickness, nasal-temporal LC curvature, superior nasal
VF sensitivity, and inferior RNFL and GCL+IPL thickness. Models using only
structural or functional features performed worse with AUC of 0.82 and 0.78,
respectively. Conclusions: Combining ONH structural and VF functional
parameters significantly improves classification of progression risk in PACG.
Inferior ONH features, MRW and RNFL thickness, were the most predictive,
highlighting the critical role of ONH morphology in monitoring disease
progression.

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Equi-mRNA," a codon-level equivariant mRNA language model that encodes synonymous codon symmetries, achieving significant improvements in mRNA-related prediction and generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for models that can effectively capture the latent structure of synonymous codon usage, which impacts translation efficiency and gene expression.

Method: Equi-mRNA incorporates mathematical symmetries as cyclic subgroups of 2D Special Orthogonal matrix (SO(2)) into its language modeling, coupled with an auxiliary equivariance loss and symmetry-aware pooling.

Result: Equi-mRNA outperforms vanilla baselines by approximately 10% in property-prediction tasks, generates more realistic mRNA sequences (up to 4x under Frechet BioDistance), and preserves functional properties better (28% improvement).

Conclusion: Equi-mRNA provides a biologically principled approach to mRNA modeling, yielding improved accuracy and deeper interpretability, with implications for next-gen therapeutics design.

Abstract: The growing importance of mRNA therapeutics and synthetic biology highlights
the need for models that capture the latent structure of synonymous codon
(different triplets encoding the same amino acid) usage, which subtly modulates
translation efficiency and gene expression. While recent efforts incorporate
codon-level inductive biases through auxiliary objectives, they often fall
short of explicitly modeling the structured relationships that arise from the
genetic code's inherent symmetries. We introduce Equi-mRNA, the first
codon-level equivariant mRNA language model that explicitly encodes synonymous
codon symmetries as cyclic subgroups of 2D Special Orthogonal matrix (SO(2)).
By combining group-theoretic priors with an auxiliary equivariance loss and
symmetry-aware pooling, Equi-mRNA learns biologically grounded representations
that outperform vanilla baselines across multiple axes. On downstream
property-prediction tasks including expression, stability, and riboswitch
switching Equi-mRNA delivers up to approximately 10% improvements in accuracy.
In sequence generation, it produces mRNA constructs that are up to
approximately 4x more realistic under Frechet BioDistance metrics and
approximately 28% better preserve functional properties compared to vanilla
baseline. Interpretability analyses further reveal that learned codon-rotation
distributions recapitulate known GC-content biases and tRNA abundance patterns,
offering novel insights into codon usage. Equi-mRNA establishes a new
biologically principled paradigm for mRNA modeling, with significant
implications for the design of next-generation therapeutics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework for efficient sampling from complex distributions by using multiscale dynamics and proposes two algorithms—MultALMC and MultCDiff—offering competitive performance without requiring learned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inefficiencies in existing score-based sampling methods, which either depend on approximations of score functions or involve costly nested MCMC loops.

Method: The framework utilizes stochastic averaging between slow-fast dynamics of stochastic differential equations to estimate scores along diffusion paths. It eliminates the need for training or inner-loop MCMC, proposing two specific algorithms: MultALMC and MultCDiff.

Result: Empirical experiments on synthetic and real-world problems show the proposed methods are competitive with existing approaches in accuracy and efficiency, even without employing learned models.

Conclusion: The proposed multiscale framework and algorithms provide an effective and theoretically sound alternative for sampling complex distributions, combining accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for efficient sampling from complex,
unnormalised target distributions by exploiting multiscale dynamics.
Traditional score-based sampling methods either rely on learned approximations
of the score function or involve computationally expensive nested Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) loops. In contrast, the proposed approach leverages
stochastic averaging within a slow-fast system of stochastic differential
equations (SDEs) to estimate intermediate scores along a diffusion path without
training or inner-loop MCMC. Two algorithms are developed under this framework:
MultALMC, which uses multiscale annealed Langevin dynamics, and MultCDiff,
based on multiscale controlled diffusions for the reverse-time
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Both overdamped and underdamped variants are
considered, with theoretical guarantees of convergence to the desired diffusion
path. The framework is extended to handle heavy-tailed target distributions
using Student's t-based noise models and tailored fast-process dynamics.
Empirical results across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, including
multimodal and high-dimensional distributions, demonstrate that the proposed
methods are competitive with existing samplers in terms of accuracy and
efficiency, without the need for learned models.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to serve as a foundational
capability across the entire lifecycle of 6G networks, spanning design,
deployment, and operation. This article proposes a native AI-driven air
interface architecture built around two core characteristics: compression and
adaptation. On one hand, compression enables the system to understand and
extract essential semantic information from the source data, focusing on task
relevance rather than symbol-level accuracy. On the other hand, adaptation
allows the air interface to dynamically transmit semantic information across
diverse tasks, data types, and channel conditions, ensuring scalability and
robustness. This article first introduces the native AI-driven air interface
architecture, then discusses representative enabling methodologies, followed by
a case study on semantic communication in 6G non-terrestrial networks. Finally,
it presents a forward-looking discussion on the future of native AI in 6G,
outlining key challenges and research opportunities.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper explores the integration of sensing, communication, and computation in an Air-FEEL system, introducing an algorithm to optimize these processes for efficient machine learning model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in federated edge learning systems where sensing data, communication network distortions, and computation interplay significantly affect learning performance.

Method: The paper analyzes convergence behavior by accounting for sensing noise and communication distortions, and designs an ISCC algorithm using alternating optimization approaches to balance batch size control and resource allocation.

Result: The results show that sensing, communication, and computation require coordinated resource management, and the ISCC algorithm effectively enhances performance while respecting constraints.

Conclusion: The study concludes that integrating ISCC processes with optimized resource allocation can maximize learning performance, validated through both theoretical and numerical results.

Abstract: This paper studies an over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) system
with integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC), in which one
edge server coordinates multiple edge devices to wirelessly sense the objects
and use the sensing data to collaboratively train a machine learning model for
recognition tasks. In this system, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is
employed to enable one-shot model aggregation from edge devices. Under this
setup, we analyze the convergence behavior of the ISCC-enabled Air-FEEL in
terms of the loss function degradation, by particularly taking into account the
wireless sensing noise during the training data acquisition and the AirComp
distortions during the over-the-air model aggregation. The result theoretically
shows that sensing, communication, and computation compete for network
resources to jointly decide the convergence rate. Based on the analysis, we
design the ISCC parameters under the target of maximizing the loss function
degradation while ensuring the latency and energy budgets in each round. The
challenge lies on the tightly coupled processes of sensing, communication, and
computation among different devices. To tackle the challenge, we derive a
low-complexity ISCC algorithm by alternately optimizing the batch size control
and the network resource allocation. It is found that for each device, less
sensing power should be consumed if a larger batch of data samples is obtained
and vice versa. Besides, with a given batch size, the optimal computation speed
of one device is the minimum one that satisfies the latency constraint.
Numerical results based on a human motion recognition task verify the
theoretical convergence analysis and show that the proposed ISCC algorithm well
coordinates the batch size control and resource allocation among sensing,
communication, and computation to enhance the learning performance.

*Zhiqiang Que,Chang Sun,Sudarshan Paramesvaran,Emyr Clement,Katerina Karakoulaki,Christopher Brown,Lauri Laatu,Arianna Cox,Alexander Tapper,Wayne Luk,Maria Spiropulu*

Main category: hep-ex

TL;DR: The paper proposes JEDI-linear, a novel GNN design with linear computational complexity optimized for FPGA deployment in HL-LHC trigger systems, achieving higher efficiency, lower latency, and resource use compared to previous designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNN-based solutions for jet tagging at CERN's HL-LHC have high computational complexity and irregular memory access patterns, making them unsuitable for FPGA hardware trigger systems with stringent latency and resource constraints.

Method: The JEDI-linear model eliminates explicit pairwise interactions by using shared transformations and global aggregation. It also employs fine-grained quantization-aware training with optimized bitwidths and replaces multipliers with distributed arithmetic for hardware efficiency.

Result: The JEDI-linear design achieves up to 11.5x lower latency, 150x lower initiation interval, and 6.2x lower LUT usage compared to state-of-the-art solutions. It also eliminates the use of DSP blocks, outperforming prior designs in both efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: JEDI-linear delivers real-time, accurate, and resource-efficient GNN inference suitable for HL-LHC's CMS Level-1 trigger. This marks a significant step in enabling next-generation trigger systems, with open-sourced templates aiding reproducibility and adoption.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly Interaction Networks (INs), have
shown exceptional performance for jet tagging at the CERN High-Luminosity Large
Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). However, their computational complexity and irregular
memory access patterns pose significant challenges for deployment on FPGAs in
hardware trigger systems, where strict latency and resource constraints apply.
In this work, we propose JEDI-linear, a novel GNN architecture with linear
computational complexity that eliminates explicit pairwise interactions by
leveraging shared transformations and global aggregation. To further enhance
hardware efficiency, we introduce fine-grained quantization-aware training with
per-parameter bitwidth optimization and employ multiplier-free
multiply-accumulate operations via distributed arithmetic. Evaluation results
show that our FPGA-based JEDI-linear achieves 3.7 to 11.5 times lower latency,
up to 150 times lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2 times lower LUT usage
compared to state-of-the-art designs while also delivering higher model
accuracy and eliminating the need for DSP blocks entirely. In contrast,
state-of-the-art solutions consume over 8,700 DSPs. This is the first
interaction-based GNN to achieve less than 60~ns latency and currently meets
the requirements for use in the HL-LHC CMS Level-1 trigger system. This work
advances the next-generation trigger systems by enabling accurate, scalable,
and resource-efficient GNN inference in real-time environments. Our
open-sourced templates will further support reproducibility and broader
adoption across scientific applications.

### [350] [Disentangling the Drivers of LLM Social Conformity: An Uncertainty-Moderated Dual-Process Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14918)
*Huixin Zhong,Yanan Liu,Qi Cao,Shijin Wang,Zijing Ye,Zimu Wang,Shiyao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This study explores how large language models (LLMs) exhibit social conformity driven by informational and normative influences, particularly under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether human psychological mechanisms like informational and normative influences under uncertainty apply to LLMs.

Method: The study adapts the information cascade paradigm from behavioral economics to test nine LLMs across different decision-making scenarios, manipulating levels of uncertainty.

Result: LLMs primarily rely on informational influence, with accuracy and confidence increasing with stronger evidence. Uncertainty significantly impacts behavior: low-to-medium uncertainty leads to conservative strategies while high uncertainty triggers normative-like amplification.

Conclusion: LLMs behave similarly to humans in processing information but show distinct amplification tendencies under high uncertainty, signaling a key behavior pattern to consider in collaborative settings.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) integrate into collaborative teams, their
social conformity -- the tendency to align with majority opinions -- has
emerged as a key concern. In humans, conformity arises from informational
influence (rational use of group cues for accuracy) or normative influence
(social pressure for approval), with uncertainty moderating this balance by
shifting from purely analytical to heuristic processing. It remains unclear
whether these human psychological mechanisms apply to LLMs. This study adapts
the information cascade paradigm from behavioral economics to quantitatively
disentangle the two drivers to investigate the moderate effect. We evaluated
nine leading LLMs across three decision-making scenarios (medical, legal,
investment), manipulating information uncertainty (q = 0.667, 0.55, and 0.70,
respectively). Our results indicate that informational influence underpins the
models' behavior across all contexts, with accuracy and confidence consistently
rising with stronger evidence. However, this foundational mechanism is
dramatically modulated by uncertainty. In low-to-medium uncertainty scenarios,
this informational process is expressed as a conservative strategy, where LLMs
systematically underweight all evidence sources. In contrast, high uncertainty
triggers a critical shift: while still processing information, the models
additionally exhibit a normative-like amplification, causing them to overweight
public signals (beta > 1.55 vs. private beta = 0.81).

TL;DR: The study proposes an interdisciplinary approach to AI curriculum development in higher education, using case analysis, curriculum mapping, and focus group interviews to align competencies, assess quality, and explore educator perspectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need to integrate AI-related skills into higher education to meet industry demands, yet research on effective interdisciplinary AI curriculum design is limited.

Method: The research employs a mixed-methods approach involving quantitative curriculum mapping and qualitative focus group interviews to study stakeholders' perspectives on developing an AI-focused undergraduate engineering program.

Result: Findings reveal insights into curriculum alignment with competencies, stakeholder perceptions of quality aspects, and the influence of educator involvement in the development process.

Conclusion: This study enhances understanding of interdisciplinary AI curriculum design and offers practical and theoretical insights for developing programs in alignment with evolving industry needs.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly impacts professional practice,
there is a growing need to AI-related competencies into higher education
curricula. However, research on the implementation of AI education within study
programs remains limited and requires new forms of collaboration across
disciplines. This study addresses this gap and explores perspectives on
interdisciplinary curriculum development through the lens of different
stakeholders. In particular, we examine the case of curriculum development for
a novel undergraduate program in AI in engineering. The research uses a mixed
methods approach, combining quantitative curriculum mapping with qualitative
focus group interviews. In addition to assessing the alignment of the
curriculum with the targeted competencies, the study also examines the
perceived quality, consistency, practicality and effectiveness from both
academic and industry perspectives, as well as differences in perceptions
between educators who were involved in the development and those who were not.
The findings provide a practical understanding of the outcomes of
interdisciplinary AI curriculum development and contribute to a broader
understanding of how educator participation in curriculum development
influences perceptions of quality aspects. It also advances the field of AI
education by providing a reference point and insights for further
interdisciplinary curriculum developments in response to evolving industry
needs.

*Al Amjad Tawfiq Isstaif,Evangelia Kalyvianaki,Richard Mortier*

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: The paper identifies and solves performance degradation caused by CPU context switching in densely packed workloads, proposing modifications to the Linux kernel scheduler that reduce cluster size requirements by 28%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors want to address performance degradation in cluster orchestrators caused by inaccuracies in node capacity/job requirements and how context switching overheads in dense workloads amplify these inefficiencies.

Method: The authors analyze the overhead from increased cost and frequency of CPU context switches in Linux's cgroups scheduling. They then modify the Linux scheduler to prioritize task completion, reducing the impact of high overheads.

Result: The proposed Linux kernel scheduler modifications achieve comparable performance but require a 28% smaller cluster size, showing significant resource optimization.

Conclusion: Optimizing the Linux scheduler by prioritizing task completion over fairness can mitigate context switching inefficiencies, reducing waste and improving performance in densely packed clusters.

Abstract: Cluster orchestrators such as Kubernetes depend on accurate estimates of node
capacity and job requirements. Inaccuracies in either lead to poor placement
decisions and degraded cluster performance. In this paper, we show that in
densely packed workloads, such as serverless applications, CPU context
switching overheads can become so significant that a node's performance is
severely degraded, even when the orchestrator placement is theoretically sound.
In practice this issue is typically mitigated by over-provisioning the cluster,
leading to wasted resources.
  We show that these context switching overhead arise from both an increase in
the average cost of an individual context switch and a higher rate of context
switching, which together amplify overhead multiplicatively when managing large
numbers of concurrent cgroups, Linux's group scheduling mechanism for managing
multi-threaded colocated workloads. We propose and evaluate modifications to
the standard Linux kernel scheduler that mitigate these effects, achieving the
same effective performance with a 28% smaller cluster size. The key insight
behind our approach is to prioritise task completion over low-level per-task
fairness, enabling the scheduler to drain contended CPU run queues more rapidly
and thereby reduce time spent on context switching.

### [353] [A Unified Framework for Inference with General Missingness Patterns and Machine Learning Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15162)
*Xingran Chen,Tyler McCormick,Bhramar Mukherjee,Zhenke Wu*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper develops a method to improve statistical inference when machine learning imputations are used to address missing data, specifically under the realistic Missing-at-Random (MAR) assumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained machine learning predictions are increasingly used for handling incomplete data in scientific analysis, but naive integration can lead to biased results. Existing methods work well under restrictive missing-completely-at-random (MCAR) assumptions but struggle under the more general MAR framework.

Method: The authors propose a method that stratifies observations by missingness patterns, then applies a masking-and-imputation procedure to complete cases, followed by aggregating results with weights. This approach ensures valid Z-estimation under MAR assumptions.

Result: The proposed method is proven to achieve asymptotic normality and greater efficiency over traditional weighted complete-case analyses. Extensive simulations validate these theoretical findings.

Conclusion: This method enables valid inference and provides practical implementation strategies for handling missing data under general MAR assumptions. Limitations, practical implications, and future research directions are discussed.

Abstract: Pre-trained machine learning (ML) predictions have been increasingly used to
complement incomplete data to enable downstream scientific inquiries, but their
naive integration risks biased inferences. Recently, multiple methods have been
developed to provide valid inference with ML imputations regardless of
prediction quality and to enhance efficiency relative to complete-case
analyses. However, existing approaches are often limited to missing outcomes
under a missing-completely-at-random (MCAR) assumption, failing to handle
general missingness patterns under the more realistic missing-at-random (MAR)
assumption. This paper develops a novel method which delivers valid statistical
inference framework for general Z-estimation problems using ML imputations
under the MAR assumption and for general missingness patterns. The core
technical idea is to stratify observations by distinct missingness patterns and
construct an estimator by appropriately weighting and aggregating
pattern-specific information through a masking-and-imputation procedure on the
complete cases. We provide theoretical guarantees of asymptotic normality of
the proposed estimator and efficiency dominance over weighted complete-case
analyses. Practically, the method affords simple implementations by leveraging
existing weighted complete-case analysis software. Extensive simulations are
carried out to validate theoretical results. The paper concludes with a brief
discussion on practical implications, limitations, and potential future
directions.

*Shonosuke Sugasawa,Daichi Mochihashi*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel class of adaptive prior distributions for sequences of orthogonal functions, demonstrating superior performance in Bayesian FPCA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for flexible and adaptive orthogonality in statistical models like FPCA, improving interpretability and efficiency of functional representations.

Method: The paper proposes a hierarchical prior construction using conditionally normal distributions with hyperparameters to control orthogonality and smoothness. This approach adjusts adaptively based on observed data and ensures near orthogonal posterior estimates.

Result: The approach yields interpretable principal functions and efficient low-rank representations in Bayesian FPCA. Simulations and real-world application on Tokyo's human mobility data confirm superior performance in inducing orthogonality and functional component estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive prior method is effective for improving model performance and interpretability in FPCA, proving its utility in practical statistical applications.

Abstract: We propose a novel class of prior distributions for sequences of orthogonal
functions, which are frequently required in various statistical models such as
functional principal component analysis (FPCA). Our approach constructs priors
sequentially by imposing adaptive orthogonality constraints through a
hierarchical formulation of conditionally normal distributions. The
orthogonality is controlled via hyperparameters, allowing for flexible
trade-offs between exactness and smoothness, which can be learned from the
observed data. We illustrate the properties of the proposed prior and show that
it leads to nearly orthogonal posterior estimates. The proposed prior is
employed in Bayesian FPCA, providing more interpretable principal functions and
efficient low-rank representations. Through simulation studies and analysis of
human mobility data in Tokyo, we demonstrate the superior performance of our
approach in inducing orthogonality and improving functional component
estimation.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper provides a theoretical analysis of generalization performance in continual ridge regression using high-dimensional linear models. It derives exact expressions for prediction risk and explores metrics like average risk, backward transfer, and forward transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to better understand generalization performance in continual learning, addressing the gap in theoretical insights compared to practical advancements.

Method: The authors use random matrix theory to derive asymptotic prediction risk for continual ridge regression and analyze evaluation metrics through theoretical risk curves.

Result: The study identifies trends in risk metrics and how model configurations affect generalization performance; findings are supported by simulation validation.

Conclusion: Insights from theoretical frameworks can enhance understanding of continual learning dynamics, highlighting the need for further study on model-specific influences on performance.

Abstract: Continual learning is motivated by the need to adapt to real-world dynamics
in tasks and data distribution while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Despite significant advances in continual learning techniques, the theoretical
understanding of their generalization performance lags behind. This paper
examines the theoretical properties of continual ridge regression in
high-dimensional linear models, where the dimension is proportional to the
sample size in each task. Using random matrix theory, we derive exact
expressions of the asymptotic prediction risk, thereby enabling the
characterization of three evaluation metrics of generalization performance in
continual learning: average risk, backward transfer, and forward transfer.
Furthermore, we present the theoretical risk curves to illustrate the trends in
these evaluation metrics throughout the continual learning process. Our
analysis reveals several intriguing phenomena in the risk curves, demonstrating
how model specifications influence the generalization performance. Simulation
studies are conducted to validate our theoretical findings.

*Philipp Alexander Schwarz,Oliver Schacht,Sven Klaassen,Johannes Oberpriller,Martin Spindler*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of identifying causal effects in multi-threshold decision-making using regression discontinuity design (RDD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of applying causal effect estimation in multidimensional cutoff rules, often encountered in production systems, as traditional methods introduce inaccuracies.

Method: Develops theoretical tools to categorize unit behavior, identify conditions for stable cutoff-effect identification, and propose methods to address non-compliant units in multi-score RDD.

Result: Validated the framework using simulated and real-world data, showing improved estimates and decreased estimation variance, especially in semiconductor manufacturing.

Conclusion: The proposed MRD framework improves causal effect analysis by addressing non-compliance and adding practical value in manufacturing settings.

Abstract: The RDD (regression discontinuity design) is a widely used framework for
identification and estimation of causal effects at a cutoff of a single running
variable. Practical settings, in particular those encountered in production
systems, often involve decision-making defined by multiple thresholds and
criteria. Common MRD (multi-score RDD) approaches transform these to a
one-dimensional design, to employ identification and estimation results.
However, this practice can introduce non-compliant behavior. We develop
theoretical tools to identify and reduce some of this "fuzziness" when
estimating the cutoff-effect on compliers of sub-rules. We provide a sound
definition and categorization of unit behavior types for multi-dimensional
cutoff-rules, extending existing categorizations. We identify conditions for
the existence and identification of the cutoff-effect on complier in multiple
dimensions, and specify when identification remains stable after excluding
nevertaker and alwaystaker. Further, we investigate how decomposing
cutoff-rules into simpler parts alters the unit behavior. This allows
identification and removal of non-compliant units potentially improving
estimates. We validate our framework on simulated and real-world data from
opto-electronic semiconductor manufacturing. Our empirical results demonstrate
the usability for refining production policies. Particularly we show that our
approach decreases the estimation variance, highlighting the practical value of
the MRD framework in manufacturing.
