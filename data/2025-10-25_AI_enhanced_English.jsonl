These discrepancies significantly\nhinder the successful transfer of systems from simulation to the real world.\nClosing this gap remains one of the most pressing challenges in robotics.\nRecent advances in sim-to-real transfer have demonstrated promising results\nacross various platforms, including locomotion, navigation, and manipulation.\nBy leveraging techniques such as domain randomization, real-to-sim transfer,\nstate and action abstractions, and sim-real co-training, many works have\novercome the reality gap. However, challenges persist, and a deeper\nunderstanding of the reality gap's root causes and solutions is necessary.

Specifically, we divide\nthe multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding\nCalibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user\nembedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single\nembedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process\nas a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical\nguarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1. With the two-step\nframework, where Embedding Calibration can be performed in parallel and\nFlexible Combination is flexible and efficient, we address CH2.

Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a\nsupplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth\ninformation of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions\nradar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to\nenable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and\ncamera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a\nradar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration\nto simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)\nthe utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately\nderive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of\nfeature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations\nof mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best\nof our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of\nradar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving\nMOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline\nthe radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced\nby real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual\ntraffic scenarios.
