While RANSAC is a robust strategy with strong probabilistic\nguarantees, the ambiguity of its inlier threshold criterion makes it\nsusceptible to false positive plane detections. This issue is particularly\nprevalent in complex real-world scenes, where the true number of planes is\nunknown and multiple planes coexist. In this paper, we aim to address this\nlimitation by proposing a generalised framework for plane detection based on\nmodel information optimization. Building on previous works, we treat the\nobserved depth readings as discrete random variables, with their probability\ndistributions constrained by the ground truth planes. Various models containing\ndifferent candidate plane constraints are then generated through repeated\nrandom sub-sampling to explain our observations. By incorporating the physics\nand noise model of the depth sensor, we can calculate the information for each\nmodel, and the model with the least information is accepted as the most likely\nground truth. This information optimization process serves as an objective\nmechanism for determining the true number of planes and preventing false\npositive detections. Additionally, the quality of each detected plane can be\nranked by summing the information reduction of inlier points for each plane. We\nvalidate these properties through experiments with synthetic data and find that\nour algorithm estimates plane parameters more accurately compared to the\ndefault Open3D RANSAC plane segmentation.

We aim to create a language model based on\nBadini's speech and evaluate its performance. To cover a conversational aspect,\nhave a proper confidence level of grammatical accuracy, and ready\ntranscriptions, we chose Badini kids' stories, eight books including 78\nstories, as the textual input.

The preprocessing produced nearly 15 hours of speech, including\n19193 segments and 25221 words. We used Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53 and\nWhisper-small to develop the language models. The experiments indicate that the\ntranscriptions process based on the Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53 model provides a\nsignificantly more accurate and readable output than the Whisper-small model,\nwith 90.38% and 65.45% readability, and 82.67% and 53.17% accuracy,\nrespectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "The study focuses on creating and evaluating speech-to-text (STT) systems for the Kurdish dialect of Badini, comparing two models to enhance linguistic accessibility.", "motivation": "Address the gap in STT systems for the underrepresented Kurdish dialect, Badini, to improve technological access and global visibility.", "method": "Used Badini kids' stories as input (15 hours of processed speech), applying the Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53 and Whisper-small models for analysis.", "result": "Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53 outperformed Whisper-small in both readability (90.38% vs. 65.45%) and accuracy (82.67% vs. 53.17%).", "conclusion": "Wav2Vec2 is a more effective model for creating accurate and readable transcriptions of Badini speech, contributing to the development of STT for underrepresented dialects."}}

To address this issue, we introduce BridgeTA, a cost-effective\ndistillation framework to bridge the representation gap between LC fusion and\nCamera-only models through a Teacher Assistant (TA) network while keeping the\nstudent's architecture and inference cost unchanged. A lightweight TA network\ncombines the BEV representations of the teacher and student, creating a shared\nlatent space that serves as an intermediate representation. To ground the\nframework theoretically, we derive a distillation loss using Young's\nInequality, which decomposes the direct teacher-student distillation path into\nteacher-TA and TA-student dual paths, stabilizing optimization and\nstrengthening knowledge transfer.
