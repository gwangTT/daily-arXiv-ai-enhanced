### [2] [Agent WARPP: Workflow Adherence via Runtime Parallel Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19543)
*Maria Emilia Mazzolenis,Ruirui Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces WARPP, a modular framework enhancing LLM task-oriented dialogue systems by combining multi-agent orchestration and runtime personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face issues handling complex workflows requiring external tool calls and personalized user information in task-oriented dialogue systems.

Method: WARPP integrates runtime branch pruning and multi-agent orchestration, using a Personalizer agent alongside domain-specific agents for real-time execution path tailoring.

Result: The framework demonstrated improved workflow adherence, tool accuracy, and reduced token usage across diverse scenarios in three domains: banking, flights, and healthcare.

Conclusion: WARPP shows promise in enhancing LLM-based systems by improving adherence to complex workflows without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in task-oriented
dialogue (TOD) systems but often struggle with long, conditional workflows that
involve external tool calls and depend on user-specific information. We present
Workflow Adherence via Runtime Parallel Personalization, or WARPP, a
training-free, modular framework that combines multi-agent orchestration with
runtime personalization to improve workflow adherence in LLM-based systems. By
dynamically pruning conditional branches based on user attributes, the
framework reduces reasoning overhead and narrows tool selection at runtime.
WARPP deploys a parallelized architecture where a dedicated Personalizer agent
operates alongside modular, domain-specific agents to dynamically tailor
execution paths in real time. The framework is evaluated across five
representative user intents of varying complexity within three domains:
banking, flights, and healthcare. Our evaluation leverages synthetic datasets
and LLM-powered simulated users to test scenarios with conditional
dependencies. Our results demonstrate that WARPP outperforms both the
non-personalized method and the ReAct baseline, achieving increasingly larger
gains in parameter fidelity and tool accuracy as intent complexity grows, while
also reducing average token usage, without any additional training.

### [3] [Hypergames: Modeling Misaligned Perceptions and Nested Beliefs for Multi-agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19593)
*Vince Trencsenyi,Agnieszka Mensfelt,Kostas Stathis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews hypergame theory applications in dynamic multi-agent systems (MAS), analyzing 44 studies across fields such as cybersecurity and robotics, while proposing a future roadmap for model improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical game theory's assumptions about rationality, complete information, and common knowledge often fail in real-world MAS due to uncertainty and misaligned beliefs. Hypergame theory seeks to address these limitations by modeling agents' subjective perceptions.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic review of 44 studies, provided a formal introduction to hypergame theory and its extensions (hierarchical hypergames and HNF), and developed frameworks to assess the applicability of agent-compatible hypergame implementations.

Result: Key findings include the dominance of hierarchical and graph-based hypergame models in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of theoretical frameworks in practical use. Identified gaps include limited use of HNF-based models and no formal languages for hypergame descriptions.

Conclusion: The study highlights trends, challenges, and open research directions for hypergame theory, aiming to better model real-world MAS and improve strategic reasoning under misalignment and uncertainty.

Abstract: Classical game-theoretic models typically assume rational agents, complete
information, and common knowledge of payoffs - assumptions that are often
violated in real-world MAS characterized by uncertainty, misaligned
perceptions, and nested beliefs. To overcome these limitations, researchers
have proposed extensions that incorporate models of cognitive constraints,
subjective beliefs, and heterogeneous reasoning. Among these, hypergame theory
extends the classical paradigm by explicitly modeling agents' subjective
perceptions of the strategic scenario, known as perceptual games, in which
agents may hold divergent beliefs about the structure, payoffs, or available
actions. We present a systematic review of agent-compatible applications of
hypergame theory, examining how its descriptive capabilities have been adapted
to dynamic and interactive MAS contexts. We analyze 44 selected studies from
cybersecurity, robotics, social simulation, communications, and general
game-theoretic modeling. Building on a formal introduction to hypergame theory
and its two major extensions - hierarchical hypergames and HNF - we develop
agent-compatibility criteria and an agent-based classification framework to
assess integration patterns and practical applicability. Our analysis reveals
prevailing tendencies, including the prevalence of hierarchical and graph-based
models in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of extensive theoretical
frameworks in practical applications. We identify structural gaps, including
the limited adoption of HNF-based models, the lack of formal hypergame
languages, and unexplored opportunities for modeling human-agent and
agent-agent misalignment. By synthesizing trends, challenges, and open research
directions, this review provides a new roadmap for applying hypergame theory to
enhance the realism and effectiveness of strategic modeling in dynamic
multi-agent environments.

### [4] [DeltaLLM: A Training-Free Framework Exploiting Temporal Sparsity for Efficient Edge LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19608)
*Jiawen Qi,Chang Gao,Zhaochun Ren,Qinyu Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeltaLLM introduces a training-free method leveraging temporal sparsity for efficient inference of large language models (LLMs) on edge devices, improving computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for deploying LLMs are incompatible with edge devices due to high computational requirements and their focus on long context lengths optimized for GPUs or TPUs.

Method: DeltaLLM introduces a temporal sparsity-aware delta matrix construction strategy and a hybrid attention mechanism combining full attention in local contexts with delta approximation for reduced computation and increased accuracy.

Result: DeltaLLM achieves up to 60% attention sparsity in the prefilling stage and 57% in both prefilling and decoding, with marginal or slight accuracy improvements using BitNet and Llama models across tasks such as WG and SQuAD-v2.

Conclusion: DeltaLLM delivers an efficient solution for LLM inference on edge devices without requiring fine-tuning, showing potential for scalability and integration in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices remains challenging
due to their quadratically increasing computations with the sequence length.
Existing studies for dynamic attention pruning are designed for hardware with
massively parallel computation capabilities, such as GPUs or TPUs, and aim at
long context lengths (e.g., 64K), making them unsuitable for edge scenarios. We
present DeltaLLM, a training-free framework that exploits temporal sparsity in
attention patterns to enable efficient LLM inference across both the prefilling
and decoding stages, on resource-constrained edge devices. DeltaLLM introduces
an accuracy- and memory-aware delta matrix construction strategy that
introduces temporal sparsity, and a context-aware hybrid attention mechanism
that combines full attention in a local context window with delta approximation
outside it to increase accuracy. We evaluate our framework on the
edge-device-friendly BitNet-b1.58-2B-4T model and Llama3.2-1B-Instruct model
across diverse language tasks. The results show that on BitNet, our framework
increases the attention sparsity from 0% to 60% during the prefilling stage
with slight accuracy improvement on the WG task, and 0% to 57% across both the
prefilling and decoding stages, with even higher F1 score from 29.63 to 30.97
on SQuAD-v2 task. On the Llama model, it can also achieve up to 60% sparsity
during the prefilling stage and around 57% across both stages with negligible
accuracy drop. These results demonstrate that DeltaLLM offers a promising
solution for efficient edge deployment, requiring no fine-tuning and seamlessly
integrating with existing inference pipelines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper surveys techniques, protocols, and findings in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, detailing methods, trade-offs, and key challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread use and societal integration of LLMs require ensuring their alignment with human values and intentions to mitigate potential risks.

Method: The authors analyze alignment paradigms, review state-of-the-art techniques like DPO and Constitutional AI, assess evaluation frameworks, and highlight AI lab strategies.

Result: The paper identifies core trade-offs in alignment objectives, discusses the strengths of various alignment methods, and reviews challenges in evaluation and oversight.

Conclusion: While progress has been made, significant open problems remain in oversight, robustness, value pluralism, and continuous alignment, necessitating further research for practical LLM alignment.

Abstract: Due to the remarkable capabilities and growing impact of large language
models (LLMs), they have been deeply integrated into many aspects of society.
Thus, ensuring their alignment with human values and intentions has emerged as
a critical challenge. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
practical alignment techniques, training protocols, and empirical findings in
LLM alignment. We analyze the development of alignment methods across diverse
paradigms, characterizing the fundamental trade-offs between core alignment
objectives. Our analysis shows that while supervised fine-tuning enables basic
instruction-following, preference-based methods offer more flexibility for
aligning with nuanced human intent. We discuss state-of-the-art techniques,
including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Constitutional AI,
brain-inspired methods, and alignment uncertainty quantification (AUQ),
highlighting their approaches to balancing quality and efficiency. We review
existing evaluation frameworks and benchmarking datasets, emphasizing
limitations such as reward misspecification, distributional robustness, and
scalable oversight. We summarize strategies adopted by leading AI labs to
illustrate the current state of practice. We conclude by outlining open
problems in oversight, value pluralism, robustness, and continuous alignment.
This survey aims to inform both researchers and practitioners navigating the
evolving landscape of LLM alignment.

### [6] [The wall confronting large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19703)
*Peter V. Coveney,Sauro Succi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs face fundamental barriers in improving prediction uncertainty due to scaling laws, potentially leading to degenerative behaviors and error accumulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address reliability challenges in LLMs and explores the limitations affecting their suitability for scientific inquiry.

Method: The authors analyze scaling laws and mechanisms fueling LLM learning, emphasizing error accumulation and structural weaknesses in large datasets.

Result: Findings suggest tensions between learning ability and accuracy in LLMs, exacerbated by spurious correlations in large datasets.

Conclusion: Avoiding the degenerative AI pathway requires emphasizing structural insights over purely scaling approaches in LLM development.

Abstract: We show that the scaling laws which determine the performance of large
language models (LLMs) severely limit their ability to improve the uncertainty
of their predictions. As a result, raising their reliability to meet the
standards of scientific inquiry is intractable by any reasonable measure. We
argue that the very mechanism which fuels much of the learning power of LLMs,
namely the ability to generate non-Gaussian output distributions from Gaussian
input ones, might well be at the roots of their propensity to produce error
pileup, ensuing information catastrophes and degenerative AI behaviour. This
tension between learning and accuracy is a likely candidate mechanism
underlying the observed low values of the scaling components. It is
substantially compounded by the deluge of spurious correlations pointed out by
Calude and Longo which rapidly increase in any data set merely as a function of
its size, regardless of its nature. The fact that a degenerative AI pathway is
a very probable feature of the LLM landscape does not mean that it must
inevitably arise in all future AI research. Its avoidance, which we also
discuss in this paper, necessitates putting a much higher premium on insight
and understanding of the structural characteristics of the problems being
investigated.

### [7] [Minding Motivation: The Effect of Intrinsic Motivation on Agent Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19725)
*Leonardo Villalobos-Arias,Grant Forbes,Jianxun Wang,David L Roberts,Arnav Jhala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of Intrinsic Motivation (IM) methods on Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents, examining reward hacking and comparing IM models with GRM in a MiniGrid environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reward-sparsity in RL agents and evaluate the unintended consequences of reward hacking caused by IM methods.

Method: Empirically compare the behavior impact of three IM techniques with GRM in a MiniGrid environment.

Result: IM methods increase initial rewards but cause changes in agent behavior, while GRM mitigated reward hacking in some scenarios.

Conclusion: IM methods can alter agent behavior due to reward hacking, but GRM can help reduce this issue in certain circumstances.

Abstract: Games are challenging for Reinforcement Learning~(RL) agents due to their
reward-sparsity, as rewards are only obtainable after long sequences of
deliberate actions. Intrinsic Motivation~(IM) methods -- which introduce
exploration rewards -- are an effective solution to reward-sparsity. However,
IM also causes an issue known as `reward hacking' where the agent optimizes for
the new reward at the expense of properly playing the game. The larger problem
is that reward hacking itself is largely unknown; there is no answer to
whether, and to what extent, IM rewards change the behavior of RL agents. This
study takes a first step by empirically evaluating the impact on behavior of
three IM techniques on the MiniGrid game-like environment. We compare these IM
models with Generalized Reward Matching~(GRM), a method that can be used with
any intrinsic reward function to guarantee optimality. Our results suggest that
IM causes noticeable change by increasing the initial rewards, but also
altering the way the agent plays; and that GRM mitigated reward hacking in some
scenarios.

### [8] [HypKG: Hypergraph-based Knowledge Graph Contextualization for Precision Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19726)
*Yuzhang Xie,Xu Han,Ran Xu,Xiao Hu,Jiaying Lu,Carl Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HypKG is a framework combining knowledge graphs (KGs) and electronic health records (EHRs) to enhance healthcare predictions using contextualized representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General Knowledge Graphs lack personalization for healthcare contexts, whereas EHRs possess rich individualized data that could enhance predictions.

Method: HypKG links entities in KGs with EHR data using advanced entity-linking techniques and employs hypergraph transformers for learning contextualized representations.

Result: Experiments with biomedical KGs and real-world EHR datasets show enhanced performance in healthcare prediction tasks with improved accuracy and adaptability of learned knowledge.

Conclusion: HypKG effectively integrates external contexts and personal data to improve precision healthcare and boosts the utility of general KGs in real-world healthcare applications.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are important products of the semantic web, which are
widely used in various application domains. Healthcare is one of such domains
where KGs are intensively used, due to the high requirement for knowledge
accuracy and interconnected nature of healthcare data. However, KGs storing
general factual information often lack the ability to account for important
contexts of the knowledge such as the status of specific patients, which are
crucial in precision healthcare. Meanwhile, electronic health records (EHRs)
provide rich personal data, including various diagnoses and medications, which
provide natural contexts for general KGs. In this paper, we propose HypKG, a
framework that integrates patient information from EHRs into KGs to generate
contextualized knowledge representations for accurate healthcare predictions.
Using advanced entity-linking techniques, we connect relevant knowledge from
general KGs with patient information from EHRs, and then utilize a hypergraph
model to "contextualize" the knowledge with the patient information. Finally,
we employ hypergraph transformers guided by downstream prediction tasks to
jointly learn proper contextualized representations for both KGs and patients,
fully leveraging existing knowledge in KGs and patient contexts in EHRs. In
experiments using a large biomedical KG and two real-world EHR datasets, HypKG
demonstrates significant improvements in healthcare prediction tasks across
multiple evaluation metrics. Additionally, by integrating external contexts,
HypKG can learn to adjust the representations of entities and relations in KG,
potentially improving the quality and real-world utility of knowledge.

### [9] [Integrating Activity Predictions in Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19733)
*Alec Scully,Cameron Stockton,Forrest Hare*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to utilize ontology-structured knowledge graphs and Markov chains for predicting future events, demonstrated using fishing vessel data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance predictive accuracy and decision-making by integrating knowledge graphs and Markov chain models, addressing limitations of current probability modeling methods.

Method: The authors organize event data within a knowledge graph using Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and Common Core Ontologies (CCO), then extract structured data to create Markov chain models for prediction. Additionally, they define 'spatiotemporal instant' to refine structural semantics and critique existing ontological probability definitions.

Result: Through integration of Markov chain models with knowledge graphs, the paper achieves prediction of future states based on historical data, proposing improved ontological interpretations of probabilities.

Conclusion: The study supports combining semantic knowledge graphs with advanced modeling techniques for predictive analytics, proposing revised probability interpretations and demonstrating practical applications in decision-making systems.

Abstract: We argue that ontology-structured knowledge graphs can play a crucial role in
generating predictions about future events. By leveraging the semantic
framework provided by Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and Common Core Ontologies
(CCO), we demonstrate how data such as the movements of a fishing vessel can be
organized in and retrieved from a knowledge graph. These query results are then
used to create Markov chain models, allowing us to predict future states based
on the vessel's history. To fully support this process, we introduce the term
`spatiotemporal instant' to complete the necessary structural semantics.
Additionally, we critique the prevailing ontological model of probability,
which conflates probability with likelihood and relies on the problematic
concept of modal measurements: measurements of future entities. We propose an
alternative view, where probabilities are treated as being about process
profiles, which better captures the dynamics of real world phenomena. Finally,
we demonstrate how our Markov chain based probability calculations can be
seamlessly integrated back into the knowledge graph, enabling further analysis
and decision-making. Keywords: predictive analytics, ontology, Markov chains,
probability, Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), knowledge graphs, SPARQL.

### [10] [Can LLMs Solve ASP Problems? Insights from a Benchmarking Study (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19749)
*Lin Ren,Guohui Xiao,Guilin Qi,Yishuai Geng,Haohan Xue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces ASPBench, a benchmark designed to assess large language models (LLMs) on tasks related to Answer Set Programming (ASP), highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in comprehensive ASP solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of LLMs in Answer Set Programming (ASP) are limited due to overly simplified ASP programs and lack of representative benchmarks. The absence of tasks specifically designed for ASP solving further restricts progress in this area.

Method: The authors developed ASPBench, a benchmark containing three tasks specific to ASP: entailment, answer set verification, and answer set computation. They evaluated 14 state-of-the-art LLMs on this benchmark to assess their capabilities.

Result: The evaluations demonstrated that while the LLMs performed well on simpler tasks like entailment and answer set verification, they struggled significantly with answer set computation, the core task in ASP solving.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that current LLMs are inadequate for comprehensive ASP solving and calls for new methods that better integrate symbolic reasoning capabilities. The introduction of ASPBench represents a step toward addressing this gap.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a powerful paradigm for non-monotonic
reasoning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising
capabilities in logical reasoning. Despite this potential, current evaluations
of LLM capabilities in ASP are often limited. Existing works normally employ
overly simplified ASP programs, do not support negation, disjunction, or
multiple answer sets. Furthermore, there is a lack of benchmarks that introduce
tasks specifically designed for ASP solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce
ASPBench, a comprehensive ASP benchmark, including three ASP specific tasks:
ASP entailment, answer set verification, and answer set computation. Our
extensive evaluations on ASPBench reveal that while 14 state-of-the-art LLMs,
including \emph{deepseek-r1}, \emph{o4-mini}, and
\emph{gemini-2.5-flash-thinking}, perform relatively well on the first two
simpler tasks, they struggle with answer set computation, which is the core of
ASP solving. These findings offer insights into the current limitations of LLMs
in ASP solving. This highlights the need for new approaches that integrate
symbolic reasoning capabilities more effectively. The code and dataset are
available at https://github.com/HomuraT/ASPBench.

### [11] [Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Objective Multi-Echelon Supply Chain Optimisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19788)
*Rifny Rachman,Josh Tingey,Richard Allmendinger,Pradyumn Shukla,Wei Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study develops a model for optimizing supply chains across multiple objectives (economic, environmental, and social) using a multi-objective RL method, outperforming other benchmarks in performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of optimizing supply chains in dynamic and complex market scenarios while considering multiple conflicting objectives such as economic, environmental, and social factors.

Method: The authors use a Markov decision process-based supply chain optimization model and evaluate it with a multi-objective reinforcement learning method, making comparisons with a modified single-objective RL approach and a MOEA-based method.

Result: The proposed approach achieves balanced trade-offs, with up to 75% higher hypervolume than MOEA and more robust solutions (11 times denser) compared to the modified single-objective RL method, while ensuring stable supply chain operations.

Conclusion: The developed multi-objective RL method is highly effective for optimizing supply chain networks, enabling superior trade-offs, robustness, and stability compared to alternative methods, making it applicable to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: This study develops a generalised multi-objective, multi-echelon supply chain
optimisation model with non-stationary markets based on a Markov decision
process, incorporating economic, environmental, and social considerations. The
model is evaluated using a multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL) method,
benchmarked against an originally single-objective RL algorithm modified with
weighted sum using predefined weights, and a multi-objective evolutionary
algorithm (MOEA)-based approach. We conduct experiments on varying network
complexities, mimicking typical real-world challenges using a customisable
simulator. The model determines production and delivery quantities across
supply chain routes to achieve near-optimal trade-offs between competing
objectives, approximating Pareto front sets. The results demonstrate that the
primary approach provides the most balanced trade-off between optimality,
diversity, and density, further enhanced with a shared experience buffer that
allows knowledge transfer among policies. In complex settings, it achieves up
to 75\% higher hypervolume than the MOEA-based method and generates solutions
that are approximately eleven times denser, signifying better robustness, than
those produced by the modified single-objective RL method. Moreover, it ensures
stable production and inventory levels while minimising demand loss.

*Xinshu Li,Ruoyu Wang,Erdun Gao,Mingming Gong,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiCap, a diffusion-based counterfactual prompt learning method addressing shortcomings in existing prompt learning approaches through a theoretically grounded framework that enhances generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods lack strong theoretical foundations, struggle with causally invariant prompts, and fail to capture robust features for generalization across categories.

Method: The authors propose DiCap, a diffusion-based framework for counterfactual prompt learning that uses a diffusion process for gradient sampling and a contrastive learning framework to generate and leverage counterfactuals aligned with causal features.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate strong performance of DiCap across various tasks like image classification, image-text retrieval, and visual question answering, especially excelling in unseen categories.

Conclusion: DiCap ensures identifiability of counterfactual outcomes while imposing bounds on estimation errors, achieving robust and generalizable prompts due to its theoretical rigor.

Abstract: Prompt learning has garnered attention for its efficiency over traditional
model training and fine-tuning. However, existing methods, constrained by
inadequate theoretical foundations, encounter difficulties in achieving
causally invariant prompts, ultimately falling short of capturing robust
features that generalize effectively across categories. To address these
challenges, we introduce the $\textit{\textbf{DiCap}}$ model, a theoretically
grounded $\textbf{Di}$ffusion-based $\textbf{C}$ounterf$\textbf{a}$ctual
$\textbf{p}$rompt learning framework, which leverages a diffusion process to
iteratively sample gradients from the marginal and conditional distributions of
the causal model, guiding the generation of counterfactuals that satisfy the
minimal sufficiency criterion. Grounded in rigorous theoretical derivations,
this approach guarantees the identifiability of counterfactual outcomes while
imposing strict bounds on estimation errors. We further employ a contrastive
learning framework that leverages the generated counterfactuals, thereby
enabling the refined extraction of prompts that are precisely aligned with the
causal features of the data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that
our method performs excellently across tasks such as image classification,
image-text retrieval, and visual question answering, with particularly strong
advantages in unseen categories.

### [13] [What Does 'Human-Centred AI' Mean?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19960)
*Olivia Guest*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper discusses AI as a relationship between humans and technology, analyzing its impact on human cognitive labor through displacement, enhancement, and replacement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge superficial understandings of human-centered AI and emphasize the relationship between AI and human cognition.

Method: Utilizes historical and conceptual examples such as abacus vs mental arithmetic and camera vs vision, along with new definitions and sociotechnical analyses.

Result: Finds that AI always implicates human cognition and argues that ignoring this relationship leads to distortion and limited critical engagement.

Conclusion: Calls for a deeper consideration of human cognitive involvement in AI systems to ensure true human-centered engineering.

Abstract: While it seems sensible that human-centred artificial intelligence (AI) means
centring "human behaviour and experience," it cannot be any other way. AI, I
argue, is usefully seen as a relationship between technology and humans where
it appears that artifacts can perform, to a greater or lesser extent, human
cognitive labour. This is evinced using examples that juxtapose technology with
cognition, inter alia: abacus versus mental arithmetic; alarm clock versus
knocker-upper; camera versus vision; and sweatshop versus tailor. Using novel
definitions and analyses, sociotechnical relationships can be analysed into
varying types of: displacement (harmful), enhancement (beneficial), and/or
replacement (neutral) of human cognitive labour. Ultimately, all AI implicates
human cognition; no matter what. Obfuscation of cognition in the AI context --
from clocks to artificial neural networks -- results in distortion, in slowing
critical engagement, perverting cognitive science, and indeed in limiting our
ability to truly centre humans and humanity in the engineering of AI systems.
To even begin to de-fetishise AI, we must look the human-in-the-loop in the

*Ebrahim Rasromani,Stella K. Kang,Yanqi Xu,Beisong Liu,Garvit Luhadia,Wan Fung Chui,Felicia L. Pasadyn,Yu Chih Hung,Julie Y. An,Edwin Mathieu,Zehui Gu,Carlos Fernandez-Granda,Ammar A. Javed,Greg D. Sacks,Tamas Gonda,Chenchan Huang,Yiqiu Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study develops and evaluates fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract pancreatic cystic lesion (PCL) features and assign risk categories from MRI/CT reports, achieving high accuracy and performance comparable to GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual extraction of PCL features is labor-intensive and limits large-scale research. Automating this task using LLMs can address this challenge and advance PCL research.

Method: A dataset of 6,000 radiology reports was labeled using a GPT-4o chain-of-thought prompting. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on this data. These LLMs categorized features into risk categories following 2017 guidelines and were evaluated on 285 human-annotated reports using accuracy, F1 scoring, and inter-reader agreement.

Result: Feature extraction accuracy improved significantly after fine-tuning (97-98%), achieving near-parity with GPT-4o. Risk categorization F1 scores for both models matched GPT-4o. Radiologist-model agreement was high and statistically indistinguishable from radiologist-only agreement.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs are capable of accurate, interpretable PCL feature extraction and risk assessment, facilitating large-scale research and achieving performance comparable to advanced proprietary models like GPT-4o.

Abstract: Background: Manual extraction of pancreatic cystic lesion (PCL) features from
radiology reports is labor-intensive, limiting large-scale studies needed to
advance PCL research. Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models
(LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign
risk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a
training dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134
patients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct
features. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated
CoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline
based on the 2017 ACR White Paper. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out
human-annotated reports. Model outputs for 100 cases were independently
reviewed by three radiologists. Feature extraction was evaluated using exact
match accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and
radiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning
improved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79%
to 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%). Risk categorization F1 scores also improved
(LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), closely matching GPT-4o (0.97), with no
statistically significant differences. Radiologist inter-reader agreement was
high (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.888) and showed no statistically significant difference
with the addition of DeepSeek-FT-CoT (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.893) or GPT-CoT
(Fleiss' Kappa = 0.897), indicating that both models achieved agreement levels
on par with radiologists. Conclusion: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with CoT
supervision enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient phenotyping for
large-scale PCL research, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o.

*Tongjie Li,Jianhua Zhang,Li Yu,Yuxiang Zhang,Yunlong Cai,Fan Xu,Guangyi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework for resource allocation in 6G networks using digital twin channels (DTC) to predict real-time channel state information (CSI), as traditional methods struggle in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emerging technologies like holographic communication and autonomous driving demand flexible, low-latency, and reliable resource allocation in 6G, which traditional methods fail to deliver optimally in dynamic and complex scenarios.

Method: The proposed framework relies on DTC-enabled environmental sensing to predict CSI, followed by game-theoretic algorithms for online and efficient resource allocation.

Result: Simulation results show that the framework surpasses pilot-based ideal CSI schemes, with throughput improvements of up to 11.5%, emphasizing its efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: The study validates that the DTC-enabled framework is effective for low-overhead, environment-aware, and scalable communication in 6G networks, addressing the limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: Emerging applications such as holographic communication, autonomous driving,
and the industrial Internet of Things impose stringent requirements on
flexible, low-latency, and reliable resource allocation in 6G networks.
Conventional methods, which rely on statistical modeling, have proven effective
in general contexts but may fail to achieve optimal performance in specific and
dynamic environments. Furthermore, acquiring real-time channel state
information (CSI) typically requires excessive pilot overhead. To address these
challenges, a digital twin channel (DTC)-enabled online optimization framework
is proposed, in which DTC is employed to predict CSI based on environmental
sensing. The predicted CSI is then utilized by lightweight game-theoretic
algorithms to perform online resource allocation in a timely and efficient
manner. Simulation results based on a digital replica of a realistic industrial
workshop demonstrate that the proposed method achieves throughput improvements
of up to 11.5\% compared with pilot-based ideal CSI schemes, validating its
effectiveness for scalable, low-overhead, and environment-aware communication
in future 6G networks.

### [16] [Matching Game Preferences Through Dialogical Large Language Models: A Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20000)
*Renaud Fabre,Daniel Egret,Patrice Bellot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating Large Language Models with GRAPHYP's network system to create a dialogical reasoning framework that makes AI decision-making more transparent and personalized.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of transparency and traceability in AI reasoning while enabling personalization based on human preferences.

Method: Developing a conceptual framework called D-LLMs, which incorporates reasoning processes, classification systems, and dialogue approaches for better user preference alignment.

Result: The framework outlines how AI could analyze preferences, resolve conflicting inputs, and make reasoning interpretable for users using GRAPHYP's network system.

Conclusion: This approach would enhance transparency, trust, and usability in AI systems by showing users the process behind decision-making and personalized responses.

Abstract: This perspective paper explores the future potential of "conversational
intelligence" by examining how Large Language Models (LLMs) could be combined
with GRAPHYP's network system to better understand human conversations and
preferences. Using recent research and case studies, we propose a conceptual
framework that could make AI rea-soning transparent and traceable, allowing
humans to see and understand how AI reaches its conclusions. We present the
conceptual perspective of "Matching Game Preferences through Dialogical Large
Language Models (D-LLMs)," a proposed system that would allow multiple users to
share their different preferences through structured conversations. This
approach envisions personalizing LLMs by embedding individual user preferences
directly into how the model makes decisions. The proposed D-LLM framework would
require three main components: (1) reasoning processes that could analyze
different search experiences and guide performance, (2) classification systems
that would identify user preference patterns, and (3) dialogue approaches that
could help humans resolve conflicting information. This perspective framework
aims to create an interpretable AI system where users could examine,
understand, and combine the different human preferences that influence AI
responses, detected through GRAPHYP's search experience networks. The goal of
this perspective is to envision AI systems that would not only provide answers
but also show users how those answers were reached, making artificial
intelligence more transparent and trustworthy for human decision-making.

*Müge Fidan,Esra Erdem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the Stable Roommates problem by introducing a method for personalized solutions, accommodating agents' preferences and social networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world Stable Roommates problems often lack stable solutions, prompting the need for "good-enough" matchings considering personalized preferences and social networks.

Method: A novel approach combining agents' habitual preferences and their social networks of preferred friends, leading to personalized matchings.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed personalized solution generation method.

Conclusion: The study concludes that their personalized method enhances solution feasibility and applicability in real-world Stable Roommates problems.

Abstract: The Stable Roommates problems are characterized by the preferences of agents
over other agents as roommates. A solution is a partition of the agents into
pairs that are acceptable to each other (i.e., they are in the preference lists
of each other), and the matching is stable (i.e., there do not exist any two
agents who prefer each other to their roommates, and thus block the matching).
Motivated by real-world applications, and considering that stable roommates
problems do not always have solutions, we continue our studies to compute
"good-enough" matchings. In addition to the agents' habits and habitual
preferences, we consider their networks of preferred friends, and introduce a
method to generate personalized solutions to stable roommates problems. We
illustrate the usefulness of our method with examples and empirical
evaluations.

*Sarat Chandra Bobbili,Ujwal Dinesha,Dheeraj Narasimha,Srinivas Shakkottai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PITA, a framework to align large language models (LLMs) with user preferences during inference without needing a pre-trained reward model or LLM fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current methods, which rely on pre-trained reward models and human preference feedback, leading to unstable processes and increased computational costs.

Method: PITA modifies token probabilities during LLM inference using a small preference-based guidance policy learned through stochastic search and iterative refinement, eliminating reliance on a reward model or LLM fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments demonstrate PITA's effectiveness in aligning LLM outputs with user preferences across diverse tasks like mathematical reasoning and sentiment classification.

Conclusion: PITA provides a computationally efficient and stable alternative to traditional methods, simplifying the incorporation of end-user preferences in LLM output generation.

Abstract: Inference-time alignment enables large language models (LLMs) to generate
outputs aligned with end-user preferences without further training. Recent
post-training methods achieve this by using small guidance models to modify
token generation during inference. These methods typically optimize a reward
function KL-regularized by the original LLM taken as the reference policy. A
critical limitation, however, is their dependence on a pre-trained reward
model, which requires fitting to human preference feedback--a potentially
unstable process. In contrast, we introduce PITA, a novel framework that
integrates preference feedback directly into the LLM's token generation,
eliminating the need for a reward model. PITA learns a small preference-based
guidance policy to modify token probabilities at inference time without LLM
fine-tuning, reducing computational cost and bypassing the pre-trained reward
model dependency. The problem is framed as identifying an underlying preference
distribution, solved through stochastic search and iterative refinement of the
preference-based guidance model. We evaluate PITA across diverse tasks,
including mathematical reasoning and sentiment classification, demonstrating
its effectiveness in aligning LLM outputs with user preferences.

### [19] [Concept Learning for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20143)
*Zhonghan Ge,Yuanyang Zhu,Chunlin Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces CMQ, a value-based method for interpretable multi-agent reinforcement learning through concept bottleneck models, balancing performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of transparency and interpretability in neural networks applied to multi-agent reinforcement learning, particularly in understanding cooperative mechanisms.

Method: The proposed method, CMQ, incorporates concept bottleneck models by conditioning credit assignment on human-like cooperation concepts. It represents these concepts as supervised vectors, enhancing interpretability without sacrificing performance.

Result: CMQ achieves superior performance on StarCraft II micromanagement and level-based foraging challenges compared to state-of-the-art methods. It offers meaningful cooperation concept representation, test-time interventions, and bias detection.

Conclusion: CMQ successfully balances interpretability and performance, advancing multi-agent reinforcement learning by introducing interpretable cooperation concepts and providing insights into cooperative mechanisms.

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in applying neural networks (NN) to multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) areas, they still largely suffer from a lack of
transparency and interoperability. However, its implicit cooperative mechanism
is not yet fully understood due to black-box networks. In this work, we study
an interpretable value decomposition framework via concept bottleneck models,
which promote trustworthiness by conditioning credit assignment on an
intermediate level of human-like cooperation concepts. To address this problem,
we propose a novel value-based method, named Concepts learning for Multi-agent
Q-learning (CMQ), that goes beyond the current performance-vs-interpretability
trade-off by learning interpretable cooperation concepts. CMQ represents each
cooperation concept as a supervised vector, as opposed to existing models where
the information flowing through their end-to-end mechanism is concept-agnostic.
Intuitively, using individual action value conditioning on global state
embeddings to represent each concept allows for extra cooperation
representation capacity. Empirical evaluations on the StarCraft II
micromanagement challenge and level-based foraging (LBF) show that CMQ achieves
superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts. The
results also demonstrate that CMQ provides more cooperation concept
representation capturing meaningful cooperation modes, and supports test-time
concept interventions for detecting potential biases of cooperation mode and
identifying spurious artifacts that impact cooperation.

*Xingcheng Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes reinforcement learning's instability in shaping behaviors of large language models, proposing a unified mathematical framework to address underlying issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the brittleness and safety-critical failures in reinforcement learning for large language models, which undermine their trustworthiness.

Method: Developing a mathematical framework to investigate policy stability and analyzing optimal actions in both single-reward and multi-reward RL scenarios. Entropy regularization is also examined.

Result: The framework explains policy brittleness through non-unique optimal actions and action degeneracy. Perturbation experiments validate findings about RL-induced failures.

Conclusion: Advances RL policy stability analysis through theory over heuristics, providing insights to design safer and more reliable AI systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) plays a crucial role in shaping the behavior of
large language and reasoning models (LLMs/LRMs). However, it often produces
brittle and unstable policies, leading to critical failures such as spurious
reasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that undermine the
trustworthiness and safety of LLMs/LRMs. Currently, these issues lack a unified
theoretical explanation and are typically addressed using ad-hoc heuristics.
This paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the
stability of the mapping from a reward function to the optimal policy. We show
that policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common
occurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This
theoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly
disparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards
that may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action
degeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting
to the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how
stability is governed by an "effective reward" aggregation mechanism. We also
prove that entropy regularization restores policy stability at the cost of
increased stochasticity. Our framework provides a unified explanation for
recent empirical findings on deceptive reasoning, instruction-following
trade-offs, and RLHF-induced sophistry, and is further validated through
perturbation experiments in multi-reward RL. This work advances
policy-stability analysis from empirical heuristics towards a principled
theory, offering essential insights for designing safer and more trustworthy AI
systems.

*Shuyang Guo,Wenjin Xie,Ping Lu,Ting Deng,Richong Zhang,Jianxin Li,Xiangping Huang,Zhongyi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HFrame, a novel graph neural network framework for efficiently addressing subgraph homomorphism problems, achieving high accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subgraph homomorphism is more complex than subgraph isomorphism due to the allowance of multiple vertices from the pattern mapping to the same graph vertex, necessitating new approaches.

Method: HFrame integrates traditional algorithmic techniques and machine learning, leveraging graph neural networks to develop a framework for tackling subgraph homomorphism efficiently.

Result: Experiments demonstrate HFrame's significant performance improvements, being up to 101.91 times faster than exact matching methods and achieving an average accuracy of 0.962.

Conclusion: The HFrame framework not only improves computational efficiency but also enhances the distinction of graph pairs in subgraph homomorphism problems.

Abstract: Homomorphism is a key mapping technique between graphs that preserves their
structure. Given a graph and a pattern, the subgraph homomorphism problem
involves finding a mapping from the pattern to the graph, ensuring that
adjacent vertices in the pattern are mapped to adjacent vertices in the graph.
Unlike subgraph isomorphism, which requires a one-to-one mapping, homomorphism
allows multiple vertices in the pattern to map to the same vertex in the graph,
making it more complex. We propose HFrame, the first graph neural network-based
framework for subgraph homomorphism, which integrates traditional algorithms
with machine learning techniques. We demonstrate that HFrame outperforms
standard graph neural networks by being able to distinguish more graph pairs
where the pattern is not homomorphic to the graph. Additionally, we provide a
generalization error bound for HFrame. Through experiments on both real-world
and synthetic graphs, we show that HFrame is up to 101.91 times faster than
exact matching algorithms and achieves an average accuracy of 0.962.

### [26] [The Blessing and Curse of Dimensionality in Safety Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20333)
*Rachel S. Y. Teo,Laziz U. Abdullaev,Tan M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates how the high-dimensional representations in large language models (LLMs) contribute to their success but also create vulnerabilities in safety alignment. It proposes lower-dimensional projections as a solution to mitigate risks associated with activation engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the increasing adoption of LLMs across domains, ensuring their safety alignment has become crucial. The growth in model dimensions contributes to their abilities but also introduces risks related to activation space exploitation.

Method: The authors analyze linear subspaces in the activation space across varying model scales. They use visualizations and empirical experiments to demonstrate how projecting high-dimensional representations to lower dimensions can address safety vulnerabilities.

Result: Empirical findings show that projecting LLM representations into lower-dimensional subspaces preserves alignment information and significantly reduces susceptibility to jailbreaking attacks through activation engineering.

Conclusion: High-dimensional representations in LLMs are both advantageous and inherently risky for safety alignment. Reducing dimensionality offers an effective pathway to enhancing model safety against exploitation.

Abstract: The focus on safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) has increased
significantly due to their widespread adoption across different domains. The
scale of LLMs play a contributing role in their success, and the growth in
parameter count follows larger hidden dimensions. In this paper, we hypothesize
that while the increase in dimensions has been a key advantage, it may lead to
emergent problems as well. These problems emerge as the linear structures in
the activation space can be exploited, in the form of activation engineering,
to circumvent its safety alignment. Through detailed visualizations of linear
subspaces associated with different concepts, such as safety, across various
model scales, we show that the curse of high-dimensional representations
uniquely impacts LLMs. Further substantiating our claim, we demonstrate that
projecting the representations of the model onto a lower dimensional subspace
can preserve sufficient information for alignment while avoiding those linear
structures. Empirical results confirm that such dimensional reduction
significantly reduces susceptibility to jailbreaking through representation
engineering. Building on our empirical validations, we provide theoretical
insights into these linear jailbreaking methods relative to a model's hidden
dimensions. Broadly speaking, our work posits that the high dimensions of a
model's internal representations can be both a blessing and a curse in safety
alignment.

*Zhipeng Tang,Sha Zhang,Jiajun Deng,Chenjie Wang,Guoliang You,Yuting Huang,Xinrui Lin,Yanyong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces VLMPlanner, a hybrid framework combining a real-time planner with a vision-language model for robust driving motion planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion planning methods lack the ability to fully capture crucial visual context, such as fine-grained road cues and unexpected obstacles, which are essential in complex driving environments.

Method: The authors propose VLMPlanner, integrating a vision-language model that processes multi-view images for visual reasoning and combines it with a learning-based real-time planner. The method includes a Context-Adaptive Inference Gate (CAI-Gate) to optimize inference frequency based on scene complexity.

Result: The framework is tested on the nuPlan benchmark, showing superior performance in handling complex road conditions and dynamic elements.

Conclusion: VLMPlanner demonstrates the potential to enhance autonomous driving by leveraging detailed visual information and adaptive inference mechanisms for improved safety and efficiency.

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into autonomous driving motion
planning has recently emerged as a promising direction, offering enhanced
interpretability, better controllability, and improved generalization in rare
and long-tail scenarios. However, existing methods often rely on abstracted
perception or map-based inputs, missing crucial visual context, such as
fine-grained road cues, accident aftermath, or unexpected obstacles, which are
essential for robust decision-making in complex driving environments. To bridge
this gap, we propose VLMPlanner, a hybrid framework that combines a
learning-based real-time planner with a vision-language model (VLM) capable of
reasoning over raw images. The VLM processes multi-view images to capture rich,
detailed visual information and leverages its common-sense reasoning
capabilities to guide the real-time planner in generating robust and safe
trajectories. Furthermore, we develop the Context-Adaptive Inference Gate
(CAI-Gate) mechanism that enables the VLM to mimic human driving behavior by
dynamically adjusting its inference frequency based on scene complexity,
thereby achieving an optimal balance between planning performance and
computational efficiency. We evaluate our approach on the large-scale,
challenging nuPlan benchmark, with comprehensive experimental results
demonstrating superior planning performance in scenarios with intricate road

### [28] [Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Mobility Resource Allocation with Hierarchical Adaptive Grouping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20377)
*Farshid Nooshi,Suining He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Hierarchical Adaptive Grouping-based Parameter Sharing (HAG-PS) technique to enhance dynamic mobility resource allocation efficiently using multi-agent reinforcement learning, verified with NYC bike-sharing data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address two challenges in mobility resource allocation using multi-agent reinforcement learning: adaptive policy-sharing across agents and memory-efficient parameter sharing in urban-scale environments.

Method: The paper proposes a hierarchical parameter sharing approach, adaptive agent grouping based on trajectory similarity, and learnable identity embeddings for agent specialization.

Result: Evaluation using NYC bike-sharing data shows that HAG-PS improves bike availability and outperforms baseline methods.

Conclusion: HAG-PS offers a promising solution for dynamically allocated mobility resources, effectively addressing scalability and efficiency challenges in urban environments.

Abstract: Allocating mobility resources (e.g., shared bikes/e-scooters, ride-sharing
vehicles) is crucial for rebalancing the mobility demand and supply in the
urban environments. We propose in this work a novel multi-agent reinforcement
learning named Hierarchical Adaptive Grouping-based Parameter Sharing (HAG-PS)
for dynamic mobility resource allocation. HAG-PS aims to address two important
research challenges regarding multi-agent reinforcement learning for mobility
resource allocation: (1) how to dynamically and adaptively share the mobility
resource allocation policy (i.e., how to distribute mobility resources) across
agents (i.e., representing the regional coordinators of mobility resources);
and (2) how to achieve memory-efficient parameter sharing in an urban-scale
setting. To address the above challenges, we have provided following novel
designs within HAG-PS. To enable dynamic and adaptive parameter sharing, we
have designed a hierarchical approach that consists of global and local
information of the mobility resource states (e.g., distribution of mobility
resources). We have developed an adaptive agent grouping approach in order to
split or merge the groups of agents based on their relative closeness of
encoded trajectories (i.e., states, actions, and rewards). We have designed a
learnable identity (ID) embeddings to enable agent specialization beyond simple
parameter copy. We have performed extensive experimental studies based on
real-world NYC bike sharing data (a total of more than 1.2 million trips), and
demonstrated the superior performance (e.g., improved bike availability) of
HAG-PS compared with other baseline approaches.

*Hafsteinn Einarsson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines spatial reasoning in LLMs without visual cues using MazeEval, revealing significant disparities across models and languages, impacting reliability in real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of evaluation on how LLMs perform pure spatial reasoning and navigation without visual information, critical for autonomous systems with limited sensory data.

Method: The paper introduces MazeEval, a benchmark that evaluates spatial reasoning in LLMs through function-calling-based maze navigation with coordinate and distance-to-wall information. It tests eight LLMs in mazes of increasing complexity up to $15\times 15$, in both English and Icelandic.

Result: OpenAI's O3 achieves success in navigating large mazes, while other models fail beyond $9\times 9$ due to looping behavior. Performance in Icelandic lags significantly compared to English, with models solving smaller mazes.

Conclusion: The findings highlight spatial reasoning gaps in LLMs tied to linguistic data patterns, underscoring the need for architectural improvements for reliable, globally applicable autonomous navigation.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power autonomous agents in
robotics and embodied AI, understanding their spatial reasoning capabilities
becomes crucial for ensuring reliable real-world deployment. Despite advances
in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs
perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for
agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this
gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure
spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our
methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of
varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate
feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test
fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across
identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic
transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while
OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$,
other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100%
of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a
cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in
Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English,
suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather
than language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications
for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial
intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability
and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable
navigation across linguistic contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing complexity and data volume in 6G and edge computing environments require innovative solutions to maintain high quality of service while addressing resource constraints.

Method: Federated Layering Techniques are used for small AI model collaboration, incorporating cloud-edge synergy, negotiation mechanisms, and privacy protections.

Result: Experimental findings show improved learning efficiency, reasoning accuracy, and privacy protection for edge nodes.

Conclusion: This approach proves effective for resilient lifelong learning systems in edge computing, significantly enhancing QoS.

Abstract: In the context of the rapidly evolving information technology landscape,
marked by the advent of 6G communication networks, we face an increased data
volume and complexity in network environments. This paper addresses these
challenges by focusing on Quality of Service (QoS) in edge computing
frameworks. We propose a novel approach to enhance QoS through the development
of General Artificial Intelligence Lifelong Learning Systems, with a special
emphasis on Federated Layering Techniques (FLT). Our work introduces a
federated layering-based small model collaborative mechanism aimed at improving
AI models' operational efficiency and response time in environments where
resources are limited. This innovative method leverages the strengths of cloud
and edge computing, incorporating a negotiation and debate mechanism among
small AI models to enhance reasoning and decision-making processes. By
integrating model layering techniques with privacy protection measures, our
approach ensures the secure transmission of model parameters while maintaining
high efficiency in learning and reasoning capabilities. The experimental
results demonstrate that our strategy not only enhances learning efficiency and
reasoning accuracy but also effectively protects the privacy of edge nodes.
This presents a viable solution for achieving resilient large model lifelong
learning systems, with a significant improvement in QoS for edge computing
environments.

*Pritom Ray Nobin,Imran Ahammad Rifat*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents STARN-GAT, a new graph attention network for predicting traffic accident severity with high accuracy across different datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to improve road safety by addressing the difficulty in modeling the complex interdependencies among spatial, temporal, and contextual factors that affect traffic accident severity.

Method: The study introduces STARN-GAT, which employs adaptive graph construction and modality-aware attention mechanisms to integrate road topology, temporal traffic data, and environmental context within a unified spatio-temporal graph framework.

Result: STARN-GAT achieves excellent performance metrics (Macro F1-score, ROC-AUC, and recall) on both the FARS and ARI-BUET datasets, demonstrating generalizability and high accuracy in identifying severe traffic incidents.

Conclusion: STARN-GAT shows promise for real-time traffic management systems by delivering accurate, interpretable accident severity predictions and supporting AI-assisted decision-making in road safety.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of traffic accident severity is critical for improving
road safety, optimizing emergency response strategies, and informing the design
of safer transportation infrastructure. However, existing approaches often
struggle to effectively model the intricate interdependencies among spatial,
temporal, and contextual variables that govern accident outcomes. In this
study, we introduce STARN-GAT, a Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention
Network, which leverages adaptive graph construction and modality-aware
attention mechanisms to capture these complex relationships. Unlike
conventional methods, STARN-GAT integrates road network topology, temporal
traffic patterns, and environmental context within a unified attention-based
framework. The model is evaluated on the Fatality Analysis Reporting System
(FARS) dataset, achieving a Macro F1-score of 85 percent, ROC-AUC of 0.91, and
recall of 81 percent for severe incidents. To ensure generalizability within
the South Asian context, STARN-GAT is further validated on the ARI-BUET traffic
accident dataset, where it attains a Macro F1-score of 0.84, recall of 0.78,
and ROC-AUC of 0.89. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in
identifying high-risk cases and its potential for deployment in real-time,
safety-critical traffic management systems. Furthermore, the attention-based
architecture enhances interpretability, offering insights into contributing
factors and supporting trust in AI-assisted decision-making. Overall, STARN-GAT
bridges the gap between advanced graph neural network techniques and practical
applications in road safety analytics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines the reliability of LLM-powered AI agents in real-world scenarios, especially under adversarial attacks, using results from a large-scale red-teaming event involving sophisticated prompt-injection attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLM-powered AI agents can be trusted to comply with deployment policies under realistic conditions and adversarial attacks.

Method: The authors conducted the largest red-teaming competition so far, involving attacks targeting 22 AI agents across diverse deployment scenarios. They built the ART benchmark from the findings and tested state-of-the-art models.

Result: More than 60,000 successful policy violations were observed, such as unauthorized actions and security breaches. Nearly all agents showed vulnerabilities across various attacks, which often transferred across models and tasks.

Conclusion: AI agents display critical and persistent vulnerabilities, regardless of model size or computational power. The paper releases resources like the ART benchmark to advance security assessments and encourage safer deployments.

Abstract: Recent advances have enabled LLM-powered AI agents to autonomously execute
complex tasks by combining language model reasoning with tools, memory, and web
access. But can these systems be trusted to follow deployment policies in
realistic environments, especially under attack? To investigate, we ran the
largest public red-teaming competition to date, targeting 22 frontier AI agents
across 44 realistic deployment scenarios. Participants submitted 1.8 million
prompt-injection attacks, with over 60,000 successfully eliciting policy
violations such as unauthorized data access, illicit financial actions, and
regulatory noncompliance. We use these results to build the Agent Red Teaming
(ART) benchmark - a curated set of high-impact attacks - and evaluate it across
19 state-of-the-art models. Nearly all agents exhibit policy violations for
most behaviors within 10-100 queries, with high attack transferability across
models and tasks. Importantly, we find limited correlation between agent
robustness and model size, capability, or inference-time compute, suggesting
that additional defenses are needed against adversarial misuse. Our findings
highlight critical and persistent vulnerabilities in today's AI agents. By
releasing the ART benchmark and accompanying evaluation framework, we aim to
support more rigorous security assessment and drive progress toward safer agent
deployment.

*Zishang Qiu,Xinan Chen,Long Chen,Ruibin Bai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MeLA is a novel Metacognitive LLM-Driven Architecture designed to evolve instructional prompts for Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD), outperforming traditional methods by enabling metacognitive refinements via feedback analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional heuristic design in evolutionary methods lacks adaptability and often results in less robust or interpretable solutions. To address this, the paper explores the idea of applying cognitive science principles to create a more intelligent and self-optimizing approach via metacognition.

Method: The paper introduces MeLA, which uses a metacognitive loop incorporating: (1) a problem analyzer for generating initial prompts, (2) an error diagnosis system for fixing heuristics, and (3) a metacognitive search engine to iteratively improve prompts based on feedback.

Result: MeLA demonstrated consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods in experiments, both on benchmark datasets and real-world problems, generating heuristics that are more effective and robust.

Conclusion: The research highlights MeLA's capability to use metacognitive regulation for improved heuristic design, suggesting a paradigm shift in AI architecture by integrating cognitive science principles into problem-solving strategies for enhanced robustness and interpretability.

Abstract: This paper introduces MeLA, a Metacognitive LLM-Driven Architecture that
presents a new paradigm for Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD). Traditional
evolutionary methods operate directly on heuristic code; in contrast, MeLA
evolves the instructional prompts used to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) in
generating these heuristics. This process of "prompt evolution" is driven by a
novel metacognitive framework where the system analyzes performance feedback to
systematically refine its generative strategy. MeLA's architecture integrates a
problem analyzer to construct an initial strategic prompt, an error diagnosis
system to repair faulty code, and a metacognitive search engine that
iteratively optimizes the prompt based on heuristic effectiveness. In
comprehensive experiments across both benchmark and real-world problems, MeLA
consistently generates more effective and robust heuristics, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Ultimately, this research demonstrates
the profound potential of using cognitive science as a blueprint for AI
architecture, revealing that by enabling an LLM to metacognitively regulate its
problem-solving process, we unlock a more robust and interpretable path to AHD.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an ASP-based interactive configuration solver designed for large-scale industrial applications, enhancing performance via new smart expansion functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in guiding users through large-scale industrial configuration problems with effective interactive systems based on ASP.

Method: Enhances multi-shot solving by introducing four smart expansion functions, applying cautious and brave consequences to limit unsatisfiability checks and reduce the search space.

Result: Improves the performance of completing partial configurations and integrates this approach into an ASP-based API-supported user interface.

Conclusion: The enhanced approach effectively minimizes unsatisfiability checks, accelerates solving processes, and supports user-oriented API interfaces for industrial scenarios.

Abstract: Product configuration is a successful application of Answer Set Programming
(ASP). However, challenges are still open for interactive systems to
effectively guide users through the configuration process. The aim of our work
is to provide an ASP-based solver for interactive configuration that can deal
with large-scale industrial configuration problems and that supports intuitive
user interfaces via an API. In this paper, we focus on improving the
performance of automatically completing a partial configuration. Our main
contribution enhances the classical incremental approach for multi-shot solving
by four different smart expansion functions. The core idea is to determine and
add specific objects or associations to the partial configuration by exploiting
cautious and brave consequences before checking for the existence of a complete
configuration with the current objects in each iteration. This approach limits
the number of costly unsatisfiability checks and reduces the search space,
thereby improving solving performance. In addition, we present a user interface
that uses our API and is implemented in ASP.

### [35] [Unlearning of Knowledge Graph Embedding via Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20566)
*Jiajun Liu,Wenjun Ke,Peng Wang,Yao He,Ziyu Shang,Guozheng Li,Zijie Xu,Ke Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphDPO, a novel approach for approximate knowledge unlearning in knowledge graph embeddings, overcoming challenges in forgetting targeted triple information and preserving knowledge integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge graphs contain outdated or erroneous information that must be removed without compromising the integrity of the remaining knowledge. Current methods struggle with inefficiency or inadvertent weakening of remaining knowledge.

Method: The proposed method, GraphDPO, reformulates unlearning as a preference optimization problem, using direct preference optimization to replace forgettable triples with reconstructed alternatives. It also introduces an out-boundary sampling strategy to reduce semantic overlap and a boundary recall mechanism to preserve relevant knowledge.

Result: GraphDPO achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with improvements of up to 10.1% in MRR_Avg and 14.0% in MRR_F1 across datasets.

Conclusion: GraphDPO effectively resolves limitations of approximate unlearning for KGs by ensuring targeted forgetting without compromising the integrity of remaining knowledge, making it a promising framework for managing dynamic knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Existing knowledge graphs (KGs) inevitably contain outdated or erroneous
knowledge that needs to be removed from knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models.
To address this challenge, knowledge unlearning can be applied to eliminate
specific information while preserving the integrity of the remaining knowledge
in KGs. Existing unlearning methods can generally be categorized into exact
unlearning and approximate unlearning. However, exact unlearning requires high
training costs while approximate unlearning faces two issues when applied to
KGs due to the inherent connectivity of triples: (1) It fails to fully remove
targeted information, as forgetting triples can still be inferred from
remaining ones. (2) It focuses on local data for specific removal, which
weakens the remaining knowledge in the forgetting boundary. To address these
issues, we propose GraphDPO, a novel approximate unlearning framework based on
direct preference optimization (DPO). Firstly, to effectively remove forgetting
triples, we reframe unlearning as a preference optimization problem, where the
model is trained by DPO to prefer reconstructed alternatives over the original
forgetting triples. This formulation penalizes reliance on forgettable
knowledge, mitigating incomplete forgetting caused by KG connectivity.
Moreover, we introduce an out-boundary sampling strategy to construct
preference pairs with minimal semantic overlap, weakening the connection
between forgetting and retained knowledge. Secondly, to preserve boundary
knowledge, we introduce a boundary recall mechanism that replays and distills
relevant information both within and across time steps. We construct eight
unlearning datasets across four popular KGs with varying unlearning rates.
Experiments show that GraphDPO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to
10.1% in MRR_Avg and 14.0% in MRR_F1.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive algorithm for compressing large multimodal models (LMMs) by optimizing sparsity and key-value (KV) cache compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMMs are powerful but challenging to deploy on edge devices due to their large size and computational requirements.

Method: An adaptive search algorithm is proposed to dynamically optimize sparsity and KV cache quantization using the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator, along with a fast pruning technique.

Result: Evaluations on LLaVA-1.5 7B and 13B demonstrate better compression performance and memory efficiency compared to SparseGPT and Wanda, without sacrificing much accuracy.

Conclusion: The method sets a new benchmark in LMM optimization, enabling efficient compression while maintaining high performance for edge deployment.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have advanced significantly by integrating
visual encoders with extensive language models, enabling robust reasoning
capabilities. However, compressing LMMs for deployment on edge devices remains
a critical challenge. In this work, we propose an adaptive search algorithm
that optimizes sparsity and KV cache compression to enhance LMM efficiency.
Utilizing the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator, our method dynamically adjusts
pruning ratios and KV cache quantization bandwidth across different LMM layers,
using model performance as the optimization objective. This approach uniquely
combines pruning with key-value cache quantization and incorporates a fast
pruning technique that eliminates the need for additional fine-tuning or weight
adjustments, achieving efficient compression without compromising accuracy.
Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including LLaVA-1.5 7B and
13B, demonstrate our method superiority over state-of-the-art techniques such
as SparseGPT and Wanda across various compression levels. Notably, our
framework automatic allocation of KV cache compression resources sets a new
standard in LMM optimization, delivering memory efficiency without sacrificing
much performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of imbalanced modality distributions in multimodal knowledge graphs, which makes it challenging to effectively utilize multimodal data for robust entity representation.

Method: The proposed framework, MoCME, includes two components: (1) Complementarity-guided Modality Knowledge Fusion (CMKF) to utilize intra-modal and inter-modal complementarity, and (2) Entropy-guided Negative Sampling (EGNS) for dynamically prioritizing important negative samples during training.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets, surpassing existing MMKGC approaches.

Conclusion: MoCME effectively enhances the robustness and effectiveness of entity representation in multimodal knowledge graphs by leveraging complementarity and adaptive sampling techniques, establishing its superiority over prior methods.

Abstract: Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion (MMKGC) aims to uncover hidden world
knowledge in multimodal knowledge graphs by leveraging both multimodal and
structural entity information. However, the inherent imbalance in multimodal
knowledge graphs, where modality distributions vary across entities, poses
challenges in utilizing additional modality data for robust entity
representation. Existing MMKGC methods typically rely on attention or
gate-based fusion mechanisms but overlook complementarity contained in
multi-modal data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Mixture of
Complementary Modality Experts (MoCME), which consists of a
Complementarity-guided Modality Knowledge Fusion (CMKF) module and an
Entropy-guided Negative Sampling (EGNS) mechanism. The CMKF module exploits
both intra-modal and inter-modal complementarity to fuse multi-view and
multi-modal embeddings, enhancing representations of entities. Additionally, we
introduce an Entropy-guided Negative Sampling mechanism to dynamically
prioritize informative and uncertain negative samples to enhance training
effectiveness and model robustness. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our MoCME achieves state-of-the-art performance,
surpassing existing approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel convolutional architecture for improved time series forecasting, focusing on capturing spatio-temporal dependencies using adaptive fuzzified temporal data construction and asymmetric convolutional designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing forecasting models struggle to effectively capture spatio-temporal dependencies and synthesize global information during learning stages.

Method: The method integrates improved fuzzy time series construction, a bilateral Atrous algorithm to reduce redundancy and computational demand, and a partially asymmetric convolutional design for enhanced spatio-temporal feature extraction within sliding windows.

Result: The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across multiple popular time series datasets, outperforming other modern approaches.

Conclusion: The novel approach successfully addresses the limitations of current forecasting models by enhancing spatio-temporal representation and optimizing computational efficiency, proving its efficacy through experimental validation.

Abstract: At present, state-of-the-art forecasting models are short of the ability to
capture spatio-temporal dependency and synthesize global information at the
stage of learning. To address this issue, in this paper, through the adaptive
fuzzified construction of temporal data, we propose a novel convolutional
architecture with partially asymmetric design based on the scheme of sliding
window to realize accurate time series forecasting. First, the construction
strategy of traditional fuzzy time series is improved to further extract short
and long term temporal interrelation, which enables every time node to
automatically possess corresponding global information and inner relationships
among them in a restricted sliding window and the process does not require
human involvement. Second, a bilateral Atrous algorithm is devised to reduce
calculation demand of the proposed model without sacrificing global
characteristics of elements. And it also allows the model to avoid processing
redundant information. Third, after the transformation of time series, a
partially asymmetric convolutional architecture is designed to more flexibly
mine data features by filters in different directions on feature maps, which
gives the convolutional neural network (CNN) the ability to construct
sub-windows within existing sliding windows to model at a more fine-grained
level. And after obtaining the time series information at different levels, the
multi-scale features from different sub-windows will be sent to the
corresponding network layer for time series information fusion. Compared with
other competitive modern models, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
results on most of popular time series datasets, which is fully verified by the
experimental results.

Motivation: The study is motivated by real-world applications, such as warehouses, where dynamic environments necessitate adaptive solutions for safe and efficient agent coordination.

Method: The paper proposes a multi-shot computational framework and an ASP-based method that combines properties of replanning and repairing approaches. It integrates a tunnel concept for precise agent movement control.

Result: Performance evaluations highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the ASP-based approach in terms of computational efficiency and solution quality.

Conclusion: The research introduces a robust approach for D-MAPF, balancing adaptability and performance while addressing practical dynamics of real-world environments like warehouses.

Abstract: MAPF problem aims to find plans for multiple agents in an environment within
a given time, such that the agents do not collide with each other or obstacles.
Motivated by the execution and monitoring of these plans, we study Dynamic MAPF
(D-MAPF) problem, which allows changes such as agents entering/leaving the
environment or obstacles being removed/moved. Considering the requirements of
real-world applications in warehouses with the presence of humans, we introduce
1) a general definition for D-MAPF (applicable to variations of D-MAPF), 2) a
new framework to solve D-MAPF (utilizing multi-shot computation, and allowing
different methods to solve D-MAPF), and 3) a new ASP-based method to solve
D-MAPF (combining advantages of replanning and repairing methods, with a novel
concept of tunnels to specify where agents can move). We have illustrated the
strengths and weaknesses of this method by experimental evaluations, from the
perspectives of computational performance and quality of solutions.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to analyze fairness as a runtime property in sequential AI systems, using coin tosses with evolving biases to examine monitoring and enforcement strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of static fairness evaluation in AI, by developing a framework that accounts for the dynamic and evolving nature of real-world AI systems.

Method: The authors use a model based on sequences of coin tosses with evolving biases to study fairness, focusing on monitoring and enforcement strategies adaptable to different dynamics, prediction horizons, and thresholds.

Result: The paper provides general findings on runtime fairness monitoring and enforcement, surveys existing solutions under specific dynamic scenarios, and explores strategies under minimal assumptions.

Conclusion: Fairness cannot be standardized into one-size-fits-all solutions. Instead, diverse approaches must address varying conditions and assumptions to monitor and enforce fairness dynamically.

Abstract: Fairness in AI is traditionally studied as a static property evaluated once,
over a fixed dataset. However, real-world AI systems operate sequentially, with
outcomes and environments evolving over time. This paper proposes a framework
for analysing fairness as a runtime property. Using a minimal yet expressive
model based on sequences of coin tosses with possibly evolving biases, we study
the problems of monitoring and enforcing fairness expressed in either toss
outcomes or coin biases. Since there is no one-size-fits-all solution for
either problem, we provide a summary of monitoring and enforcement strategies,
parametrised by environment dynamics, prediction horizon, and confidence
thresholds. For both problems, we present general results under simple or
minimal assumptions. We survey existing solutions for the monitoring problem
for Markovian and additive dynamics, and existing solutions for the enforcement
problem in static settings with known dynamics.

### [41] [Learning the Value Systems of Societies from Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20728)
*Andrés Holgado-Sánchez,Holger Billhardt,Sascha Ossowski,Sara Degli-Esposti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses ethical AI by proposing a method for learning societal value systems through heuristic deep clustering, using observed human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ethical AI requires aligning AI decision-making with human and stakeholder value systems, which are challenging to elicit and represent manually.

Method: The paper formalizes the problem of societal value systems and introduces heuristic deep clustering to learn socially shared values and diverse group-specific value systems from human preference data.

Result: The proposed approach was evaluated in a real-world use case involving travel decision data.

Conclusion: The research suggests that AI systems can better align with societal values by considering diverse value systems within a society, supported by data-driven methods like heuristic deep clustering.

Abstract: Aligning AI systems with human values and the value-based preferences of
various stakeholders (their value systems) is key in ethical AI. In value-aware
AI systems, decision-making draws upon explicit computational representations
of individual values (groundings) and their aggregation into value systems. As
these are notoriously difficult to elicit and calibrate manually, value
learning approaches aim to automatically derive computational models of an
agent's values and value system from demonstrations of human behaviour.
Nonetheless, social science and humanities literature suggest that it is more
adequate to conceive the value system of a society as a set of value systems of
different groups, rather than as the simple aggregation of individual value
systems. Accordingly, here we formalize the problem of learning the value
systems of societies and propose a method to address it based on heuristic deep
clustering. The method learns socially shared value groundings and a set of
diverse value systems representing a given society by observing qualitative
value-based preferences from a sample of agents. We evaluate the proposal in a
use case with real data about travelling decisions.

Result: AI interventions enhanced listenership and led to statistically significant improvements in health behaviors like taking iron/calcium supplements and understanding critical health topics.

Conclusion: AI has the potential to drive impactful changes in health behaviors and knowledge, highlighting its role in improving maternal and child health outcomes.

Abstract: Automated voice calls with health information are a proven method for
disseminating maternal and child health information among beneficiaries and are
deployed in several programs around the world. However, these programs often
suffer from beneficiary dropoffs and poor engagement. In previous work, through
real-world trials, we showed that an AI model, specifically a restless bandit
model, could identify beneficiaries who would benefit most from live service
call interventions, preventing dropoffs and boosting engagement. However, one
key question has remained open so far: does such improved listenership via
AI-targeted interventions translate into beneficiaries' improved knowledge and
health behaviors? We present a first study that shows not only listenership
improvements due to AI interventions, but also simultaneously links these
improvements to health behavior changes. Specifically, we demonstrate that
AI-scheduled interventions, which enhance listenership, lead to statistically
significant improvements in beneficiaries' health behaviors such as taking iron
or calcium supplements in the postnatal period, as well as understanding of
critical health topics during pregnancy and infancy. This underscores the
potential of AI to drive meaningful improvements in maternal and child health.

*Hao Yang,Qinghua Zhao,Lei Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines how Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting works, finding that it prunes decoding space and modulates neuron activation based on task type.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover the underlying mechanisms of CoT prompting, as this method significantly improves reasoning but remains poorly understood.

Method: Reverse trace the information flow through decoding, projection, and activation phases, using a quantitative analysis of CoT effects on system behavior.

Result: CoT serves as a decoding space pruner using templates, improves performance when adhered to, and modulates neuron engagement differently in open vs. closed-domain tasks.

Conclusion: The findings enhance interpretability of CoT prompting, suggesting it can guide the design of effective and robust prompts through task-specific interventions.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting significantly enhances model reasoning, yet
its internal mechanisms remain poorly understood. We analyze CoT's operational
principles by reversely tracing information flow across decoding, projection,
and activation phases. Our quantitative analysis suggests that CoT may serve as
a decoding space pruner, leveraging answer templates to guide output
generation, with higher template adherence strongly correlating with improved
performance. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that CoT modulates neuron
engagement in a task-dependent manner: reducing neuron activation in
open-domain tasks, yet increasing it in closed-domain scenarios. These findings
offer a novel mechanistic interpretability framework and critical insights for
enabling targeted CoT interventions to design more efficient and robust
prompts. We released our code and data at

### [44] [evalSmarT: An LLM-Based Framework for Evaluating Smart Contract Generated Comments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20774)
*Fatou Ndiaye Mbodji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces evalSmarT, a framework using large language models (LLMs) to evaluate smart contract comment generation, addressing limitations of traditional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving evaluation methods for smart contract comment generation, which traditional metrics fail to assess effectively, while avoiding costly human evaluations.

Method: Developed evalSmarT, combining 40 LLMs with 10 prompting strategies to create over 400 evaluator configurations for benchmarking and output selection.

Result: Found that prompt design plays a crucial role in achieving human-like judgment and showed that LLM-based evaluations are scalable and semantically enhanced compared to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: The evalSmarT framework provides a novel, scalable, and effective way to evaluate smart contract comment generation, emphasizing the importance of prompt strategies.

Abstract: Smart contract comment generation has gained traction as a means to improve
code comprehension and maintainability in blockchain systems. However,
evaluating the quality of generated comments remains a challenge. Traditional
metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture domain-specific nuances, while
human evaluation is costly and unscalable. In this paper, we present
\texttt{evalSmarT}, a modular and extensible framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) as evaluators. The system supports over 400 evaluator
configurations by combining approximately 40 LLMs with 10 prompting strategies.
We demonstrate its application in benchmarking comment generation tools and
selecting the most informative outputs. Our results show that prompt design
significantly impacts alignment with human judgment, and that LLM-based
evaluation offers a scalable and semantically rich alternative to existing
methods.

### [45] [MMGraphRAG: Bridging Vision and Language with Interpretable Multimodal Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20804)
*Xueyao Wan,Hang Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMGraphRAG combines scene graphs and multimodal knowledge graphs to enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation using both images and texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal RAG systems fail to integrate structured interconnections between images and text while requiring extensive training for specific tasks.

Method: MMGraphRAG refines visual data via scene graphs, creates multimodal knowledge graphs, links entities through spectral clustering, and uses reasoning paths to assist generation.

Result: Experimental data shows state-of-the-art results on DocBench and MMLongBench, with improved adaptability and reasoning pathways.

Conclusion: MMGraphRAG improves upon limitations of current methods by effectively integrating multimodal knowledge through structured reasoning and enhancing task adaptability.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language model generation by
retrieving relevant information from external knowledge bases. However,
conventional RAG methods face the issue of missing multimodal information.
Multimodal RAG methods address this by fusing images and text through mapping
them into a shared embedding space, but they fail to capture the structure of
knowledge and logical chains between modalities. Moreover, they also require
large-scale training for specific tasks, resulting in limited generalizing
ability. To address these limitations, we propose MMGraphRAG, which refines
visual content through scene graphs and constructs a multimodal knowledge graph
(MMKG) in conjunction with text-based KG. It employs spectral clustering to
achieve cross-modal entity linking and retrieves context along reasoning paths
to guide the generative process. Experimental results show that MMGraphRAG
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DocBench and MMLongBench datasets,
demonstrating strong domain adaptability and clear reasoning paths.

### [46] [Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Graph Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20951)
*Yang You,Vincent Thomas,Alex Schutz,Robert Skilton,Nick Hawes,Olivier Buffet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new sampling-based algorithm, POMCGS, to efficiently solve large POMDPs offline, enabling policy generation comparable to online methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large POMDPs often rely on sampling-based online methods due to computational challenges, but offline policies are preferable in applications with time or energy restrictions.

Method: The proposed POMCGS algorithm constructs a folded policy graph using Monte Carlo simulations and introduces techniques such as action progressive widening and observation clustering for handling certain continuous POMDPs.

Result: Experiments show that POMCGS can solve complex POMDPs previously unsolvable by offline algorithms, with competitive policy values compared to state-of-the-art online methods.

Conclusion: POMCGS successfully reduces computational demands, allowing the generation and validation of offline policies for large POMDPs, potentially transforming practice in constrained environments.

Abstract: Currently, large partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are
often solved by sampling-based online methods which interleave planning and
execution phases. However, a pre-computed offline policy is more desirable in
POMDP applications with time or energy constraints. But previous offline
algorithms are not able to scale up to large POMDPs. In this article, we
propose a new sampling-based algorithm, the partially observable Monte-Carlo
graph search (POMCGS) to solve large POMDPs offline. Different from many online
POMDP methods, which progressively develop a tree while performing
(Monte-Carlo) simulations, POMCGS folds this search tree on the fly to
construct a policy graph, so that computations can be drastically reduced, and
users can analyze and validate the policy prior to embedding and executing it.
Moreover, POMCGS, together with action progressive widening and observation
clustering methods provided in this article, is able to address certain
continuous POMDPs. Through experiments, we demonstrate that POMCGS can generate
policies on the most challenging POMDPs, which cannot be computed by previous
offline algorithms, and these policies' values are competitive compared with
the state-of-the-art online POMDP algorithms.

### [47] [On the Limits of Hierarchically Embedded Logic in Classical Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20960)
*Bill Cochran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a formal model for understanding reasoning limitations in large neural networks based on their depth, offering explanations for observed deficiencies and suggesting future improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reasoning limitations in current large neural net models for language, particularly related to logical expressiveness and phenomena like hallucination and repetition.

Method: A formal representation of neural networks as linear operators over logic predicate space is proposed, with proofs illustrating depth-based limitations in encoding higher-order logic.

Result: The depth of neural networks imposes strict upper bounds on logical expressiveness, providing insight into tokenization challenges and the inability to handle higher-order predicates.

Conclusion: The findings encourage designing deeper architectures or new strategies for improving logical reasoning and interpretability in neural language models.

Abstract: We propose a formal model of reasoning limitations in large neural net models
for language, grounded in the depth of their neural architecture. By treating
neural networks as linear operators over logic predicate space we show that
each layer can encode at most one additional level of logical reasoning. We
prove that a neural network of depth a particular depth cannot faithfully
represent predicates in a one higher order logic, such as simple counting over
complex predicates, implying a strict upper bound on logical expressiveness.
This structure induces a nontrivial null space during tokenization and
embedding, excluding higher-order predicates from representability. Our
framework offers a natural explanation for phenomena such as hallucination,
repetition, and limited planning, while also providing a foundation for
understanding how approximations to higher-order logic may emerge. These
results motivate architectural extensions and interpretability strategies in
future development of language models.

### [48] [Core Safety Values for Provably Corrigible Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20964)
*Aran Nayebi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework for ensuring corrigibility in multi-step, partially observed environments with provable guarantees by separating the utility heads and combining them lexicographically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the problem of safely designing autonomous agents, particularly focusing on corrigibility—a property that ensures agents accept corrections without acting against human preferences.

Method: The framework replaces a single scalar reward with five utility heads that cover distinct components of safety and combines them lexicographically to dominate conflicting incentives. Guarantees are proven under certain learning and planning sub-optimality assumptions.

Result: The theoretical proofs demonstrate corrigibility in single-round and multi-step scenarios, robustness to adversarial modifications up to a decidable subset, and practicality for implementation in ML-based autonomous systems.

Conclusion: The framework provides clearer implementation guidance for modern AI systems while ensuring safety properties under provable bounds, shifting reward-hacking risks to evaluation quality rather than hidden incentive leaks.

Abstract: We introduce the first implementable framework for corrigibility, with
provable guarantees in multi-step, partially observed environments. Our
framework replaces a single opaque reward with five *structurally separate*
utility heads -- deference, switch-access preservation, truthfulness,
low-impact behavior via a belief-based extension of Attainable Utility
Preservation, and bounded task reward -- combined lexicographically by strict
weight gaps. Theorem 1 proves exact single-round corrigibility in the partially
observable off-switch game; Theorem 3 extends the guarantee to multi-step,
self-spawning agents, showing that even if each head is \emph{learned} to
mean-squared error $\varepsilon$ and the planner is $\varepsilon$-sub-optimal,
the probability of violating \emph{any} safety property is bounded while still
ensuring net human benefit. In contrast to Constitutional AI or RLHF/RLAIF,
which merge all norms into one learned scalar, our separation makes obedience
and impact-limits dominate even when incentives conflict. For open-ended
settings where adversaries can modify the agent, we prove that deciding whether
an arbitrary post-hack agent will ever violate corrigibility is undecidable by
reduction to the halting problem, then carve out a finite-horizon ``decidable
island'' where safety can be certified in randomized polynomial time and
verified with privacy-preserving, constant-round zero-knowledge proofs.
Consequently, the remaining challenge is the ordinary ML task of data coverage
and generalization: reward-hacking risk is pushed into evaluation quality
rather than hidden incentive leak-through, giving clearer implementation
guidance for today's LLM assistants and future autonomous systems.

### [49] [MIRAGE-Bench: LLM Agent is Hallucinating and Where to Find Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21017)
*Weichen Zhang,Yiyou Sun,Pohao Huang,Jiayue Pu,Heyue Lin,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIRAGE-Bench, a unified benchmark that evaluates hallucinations in interactive scenarios involving large language model (LLM)-based agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLM agents pose significant risks during interaction, stemming from misinformation or flawed cognitive processes. Current tools to assess these errors are fragmented, necessitating a comprehensive benchmark.

Method: The authors define a taxonomy for hallucinations based on discrepancies in task instructions, execution history, and environment observations. MIRAGE-Bench employs systematic audits, synthesized test cases, and tailored prompts for testable and reproducible evaluations.

Result: MIRAGE-Bench successfully elicited and evaluated hallucinative actions in LLM-based agents, revealing key failure modes and providing high-fidelity assessments.

Conclusion: This benchmark lays the foundation for understanding and mitigating hallucinations in interactive settings, offering a structured approach for advancing LLM-agent performance.

Abstract: Hallucinations pose critical risks for large language model (LLM)-based
agents, often manifesting as hallucinative actions resulting from fabricated or
misinterpreted information within the cognitive context. While recent studies
have exposed such failures, existing evaluations remain fragmented and lack a
principled testbed. In this paper, we present MIRAGE-Bench--Measuring Illusions
in Risky AGEnt settings--the first unified benchmark for eliciting and
evaluating hallucinations in interactive LLM-agent scenarios. We begin by
introducing a three-part taxonomy to address agentic hallucinations: actions
that are unfaithful to (i) task instructions, (ii) execution history, or (iii)
environment observations. To analyze, we first elicit such failures by
performing a systematic audit of existing agent benchmarks, then synthesize
test cases using a snapshot strategy that isolates decision points in
deterministic and reproducible manners. To evaluate hallucination behaviors, we
adopt a fine-grained-level LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with tailored risk-aware
prompts, enabling scalable, high-fidelity assessment of agent actions without
enumerating full action spaces. MIRAGE-Bench provides actionable insights on
failure modes of LLM agents and lays the groundwork for principled progress in
mitigating hallucinations in interactive environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GenoMAS introduces a team of LLM-based agents to analyze gene expression data, outperforming previous methods in accuracy while balancing structured workflows and autonomous adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in extracting insights from raw transcriptomic data due to file complexity and the need for domain expertise. Existing methods lack flexibility in edge cases or precision for rigorous analysis.

Method: Utilizes six LLM agents organized with typed message-passing protocols. A guided-planning framework enables the system to adaptively unfold high-level tasks into actionable steps, maintaining coherence and accommodating genomic data specifics.

Result: Achieved 89.13% Composite Similarity Correlation in data preprocessing and an F1-score of 60.48% for gene identification, surpassing prior methods by 10.61% and 16.85%, respectively. Extracted biologically plausible gene-phenotype associations confirmed by literature.

Conclusion: GenoMAS offers a scalable and adaptive solution for transcriptomic data analysis, improving accuracy, maintaining scientific rigor, and providing biologically relevant insights.

Abstract: Gene expression analysis holds the key to many biomedical discoveries, yet
extracting insights from raw transcriptomic data remains formidable due to the
complexity of multiple large, semi-structured files and the need for extensive
domain expertise. Current automation approaches are often limited by either
inflexible workflows that break down in edge cases or by fully autonomous
agents that lack the necessary precision for rigorous scientific inquiry.
GenoMAS charts a different course by presenting a team of LLM-based scientists
that integrates the reliability of structured workflows with the adaptability
of autonomous agents. GenoMAS orchestrates six specialized LLM agents through
typed message-passing protocols, each contributing complementary strengths to a
shared analytic canvas. At the heart of GenoMAS lies a guided-planning
framework: programming agents unfold high-level task guidelines into Action
Units and, at each juncture, elect to advance, revise, bypass, or backtrack,
thereby maintaining logical coherence while bending gracefully to the
idiosyncrasies of genomic data.
  On the GenoTEX benchmark, GenoMAS reaches a Composite Similarity Correlation
of 89.13% for data preprocessing and an F$_1$ of 60.48% for gene
identification, surpassing the best prior art by 10.61% and 16.85%
respectively. Beyond metrics, GenoMAS surfaces biologically plausible
gene-phenotype associations corroborated by the literature, all while adjusting
for latent confounders. Code is available at https://github.com/Liu-Hy/GenoMAS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper surveys methods and frameworks for creating self-evolving agents capable of real-time adaptation in dynamic environments, emphasizing architectures, algorithms, and applications leading towards Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models are limited by their static nature, unable to adapt dynamically to new tasks or evolving contexts, creating a bottleneck for deployment in interactive environments.

Method: The authors systematically review evolutionary mechanisms, adaptation methods, and design architectures for self-evolving agents, categorizing them across dimensions such as agent components and stages of adaptation.

Result: The paper identifies existing methods, evaluation metrics, and use cases (e.g., coding, education, healthcare) while outlining challenges in safety and scalability.

Conclusion: By offering a structured framework and discussing future research directions, the paper aims to set a foundation for advancing adaptive systems capable of autonomous evolution towards Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI).

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities but remain
fundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks,
evolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are
increasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static
nature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can
adaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from
scaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing
interest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and
adaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the
first systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized
around three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how
to evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g.,
models, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages
(e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and
architectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards,
textual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we
analyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents,
highlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare,
and identify critical challenges and research directions in safety,
scalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework
for understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a
roadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world
deployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of
Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously,
performing at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: MCP4EDA is the first protocol making EDA workflows controllable via AI assistants, showing remarkable improvements in timing and area metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EDA toolchains are complex and often optimized inefficiently due to the gap between synthesis estimates and physical implementation results.

Method: MCP4EDA enables LLM-controlled optimization using real backend performance data, facilitating conversational interaction and iterative refinement of synthesis scripts.

Result: Demonstrated 15-30% timing improvement and 10-20% area reduction in digital design benchmarks compared to default flows.

Conclusion: MCP4EDA is a groundbreaking integration of AI and EDA workflows, showcasing practical end-to-end automation with measurable gains in design metrics.

Abstract: This paper presents MCP4EDA, the first Model Context Protocol server that
enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to control and optimize the complete
open-source RTL-to-GDSII design flow through natural language interaction. The
system integrates Yosys synthesis, Icarus Verilog simulation, OpenLane
place-and-route, GTKWave analysis, and KLayout visualization into a unified
LLM-accessible interface, enabling designers to execute complex multi-tool EDA
workflows conversationally via AI assistants such as Claude Desktop and Cursor
IDE. The principal contribution is a backend-aware synthesis optimization
methodology wherein LLMs analyze actual post-layout timing, power, and area
metrics from OpenLane results to iteratively refine synthesis TCL scripts,
establishing a closed-loop optimization system that bridges the traditional gap
between synthesis estimates and physical implementation reality. In contrast to
conventional flows that rely on wire-load models, this methodology leverages
real backend performance data to guide synthesis parameter tuning, optimization
sequence selection, and constraint refinement, with the LLM functioning as an
intelligent design space exploration agent. Experimental evaluation on
representative digital designs demonstrates 15-30% improvements in timing
closure and 10-20% area reduction compared to default synthesis flows,
establishing MCP4EDA as the first practical LLM-controlled end-to-end
open-source EDA automation system. The code and demo are avaiable at:

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChipletPart, a cost-driven system partitioner optimized for chiplet-based 2.5D designs, achieving significant cost reductions compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing industry adoption of chiplets for cost-efficient high-performance systems, there is a need for better methods to partition these systems effectively while addressing their unique design and manufacturing constraints.

Method: The authors developed ChipletPart, which employs a genetic algorithm for technology assignment and partitioning, integrated with a simulated annealing-based floorplanner, alongside a comprehensive chiplet cost model.

Result: ChipletPart achieves a cost reduction of up to 58% compared to min-cut partitioners and up to 47% compared to the prior work, Floorplet. Heterogeneous integration further reduces costs by up to 43%.

Conclusion: ChipletPart provides a powerful, cost-driven partitioning solution for chiplet-based designs, offering substantial improvements over prior methods while being openly available to the community.

Abstract: Industry adoption of chiplets has been increasing as a cost-effective option
for making larger high-performance systems. Consequently, partitioning large
systems into chiplets is increasingly important. In this work, we introduce
ChipletPart - a cost-driven 2.5D system partitioner that addresses the unique
constraints of chiplet systems, including complex objective functions, limited
reach of inter-chiplet I/O transceivers, and the assignment of heterogeneous
manufacturing technologies to different chiplets. ChipletPart integrates a
sophisticated chiplet cost model with its underlying genetic algorithm-based
technology assignment and partitioning methodology, along with a simulated
annealing-based chiplet floorplanner. Our results show that: (i) ChipletPart
reduces chiplet cost by up to 58% (20% geometric mean) compared to
state-of-the-art min-cut partitioners, which often yield floorplan-infeasible
solutions; (ii) ChipletPart generates partitions with up to 47% (6% geometric
mean) lower cost as compared to the prior work Floorplet; and (iii) for the
testcases we study, heterogeneous integration reduces cost by up to 43% (15%
geometric mean) compared to homogeneous implementations. We also present case
studies that show how changes in packaging or inter-chiplet signaling
technologies can affect partitioning solutions. Finally, we make ChipletPart,
the underlying chiplet cost model, and a chiplet testcase generator available
as open-source tools for the community.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AxOSyn, an open-source framework for designing energy-efficient, approximate arithmetic operators (AxOs), enabling both selection and synthesis approaches in approximate computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current tools for approximate computing, which are constrained in flexibility and granularity. The goal is to propose a solution for exploring and optimizing AxOs for resource-constrained edge AI systems.

Method: AxOSyn offers a framework that supports design space exploration (DSE) for AxOs at various abstraction levels. It enables both selection-based and synthesis-based approaches and can accommodate custom evaluation methods for application-specific needs.

Result: AxOSyn successfully facilitates the exploration and synthesis of energy-efficient approximate operators, allowing finer control and optimization.

Conclusion: AxOSyn advances the field of approximate computing by providing a versatile and open-source tool that enhances energy efficiency and achieves application-specific optimization in edge AI deployments.

Abstract: Edge AI deployments are becoming increasingly complex, necessitating
energy-efficient solutions for resource-constrained embedded systems.
Approximate computing, which allows for controlled inaccuracies in
computations, is emerging as a promising approach for improving power and
energy efficiency. Among the key techniques in approximate computing are
approximate arithmetic operators (AxOs), which enable application-specific
optimizations beyond traditional computer arithmetic hardware reduction-based
methods, such as quantization and precision scaling. Existing design space
exploration (DSE) frameworks for approximate computing limit themselves to
selection-based approaches or custom synthesis at fixed abstraction levels,
which restricts the flexibility required for finding application-specific
optimal solutions. Further, the tools available for the DSE of AxOs are quite
limited in terms of exploring different approximation models and extending the
analysis to different granularities. To this end, we propose AxOSyn, an
open-source framework for the DSE of AxOs that supports both selection and
synthesis approaches at various abstraction levels. AxOSyn allows researchers
to integrate custom methods for evaluating approximations and facilitates DSE
at both the operator-level and application-specific. Our framework provides an
effective methodology for achieving energy-efficient, approximate operators.

*Maximilian Jakob Heer,Benjamin Ramhorst,Yu Zhu,Luhao Liu,Zhiyi Hu,Jonas Dann,Gustavo Alonso*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper presents RoCE BALBOA, an open-source and customizable RDMA-stack designed for machine learning and data-intensive applications in data centers, showing performance comparable to commercial NICs while enabling new use cases in SmartNICs and accelerators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern data centers face a network bottleneck due to increasingly data-intensive applications like machine learning, necessitating advancements in network protocols and infrastructure such as RDMA and SmartNICs for performance optimization.

Method: The authors design and implement RoCE BALBOA, an open-source, RoCE v2-compatible RDMA-stack deployed on FPGAs, which is capable of supporting hundreds of queue pairs and 100G throughput. They demonstrate its customizability and use cases by exploring protocol enhancements and deep packet inspection.

Result: RoCE BALBOA was deployed on an FPGA-based cluster and showed latency and performance comparable to commercial NICs. It enabled the development of advanced use cases like in-network encryption, machine learning-based packet inspection, and commercial data preprocessing for recommender systems.

Conclusion: RoCE BALBOA provides a flexible, high-performance platform for deploying and experimenting with SmartNICs and accelerators, offering adaptability that is not available in commercial solutions and fostering innovation in in-network computing.

Abstract: Data-intensive applications in data centers, especially machine learning
(ML), have made the network a bottleneck, which in turn has motivated the
development of more efficient network protocols and infrastructure. For
instance, remote direct memory access (RDMA) has become the standard protocol
for data transport in the cloud as it minimizes data copies and reduces
CPU-utilization via host-bypassing. Similarly, an increasing amount of network
functions and infrastructure have moved to accelerators, SmartNICs, and
in-network computing to bypass the CPU. In this paper we explore the
implementation and deployment of RoCE BALBOA, an open-source, RoCE
v2-compatible, scalable up to hundreds of queue-pairs, and 100G-capable
RDMA-stack that can be used as the basis for building accelerators and
smartNICs. RoCE BALBOA is customizable, opening up a design space and offering
a degree of adaptability not available in commercial products. We have deployed
BALBOA in a cluster using FPGAs and show that it has latency and performance
characteristics comparable to commercial NICs. We demonstrate its potential by
exploring two classes of use cases. One involves enhancements to the protocol
for infrastructure purposes (encryption, deep packet inspection using ML). The
other showcases the ability to perform line-rate compute offloads with deep
pipelines by implementing commercial data preprocessing pipelines for
recommender systems that process the data as it arrives from the network before
transferring it directly to the GPU. These examples demonstrate how BALBOA
enables the exploration and development of SmartNICs and accelerators operating
on network data streams.

*Md Rownak Hossain Chowdhury,Mostafizur Rahman*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework that reinterprets 7D convolution loops for enhanced hardware-centric AI acceleration, achieving high performance without relying on traditional transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Convolution operations dominate AI workloads, often constituting 80-90% of the effort. Current approaches, like loop unrolling or GEMM-based transformations, add considerable overhead. A better methodology is required to optimize data movement and instruction control.

Method: The authors reconceptualize convolution loop nests as a hardware-centric data and instruction streaming problem. This is treated as a set of tunable spatial and temporal mappings based on hardware parameters like compute element distribution and interconnect topology. They implement this on the MAVeC accelerator and extend it to VGG-16 inference.

Result: PE utilization reached over 90%, with high fold reuse and scalable throughput of 1.56 TFLOPs/sec and 12.7 KIPS. The framework efficiently supports large convolution processes with minimal control and data overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed hardware-centric framework achieves efficient and flexible convolution processing on accelerators like MAVeC, avoiding reliance on traditional heavyweight transformations. This approach improves data locality and sustains high computational efficiency.

Abstract: Convolution remains the most compute-intensive operation in AI acceleration,
often constituting over 80-90% of the workload. Existing approaches in spatial
architectures such as coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) and
field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) frequently rely on loop unrolling or
GEMM-based matrix transformations, introducing significant overhead in both
data movement and instruction control. This paper presents a new framework
designed to systematically demystify the 7-dimensional convolution loop nest by
reinterpreting it as a hardware-centric data and instruction streaming problem.
Instead of treating the loop nest as a fixed computational construct, our
approach exposes its structure as a set of spatial and temporal mappings
governed by hardware parameters such as compute element distribution,
interconnect topology, and reconfigurability. This abstraction supports
lightweight, flexible deployment of convolution without reliance on heavyweight
transformations or reordering schemes. We demonstrate the application of our
approach on the MAVeC accelerator. We detail the implementation of convolution
operations in MAVeC and extend the framework to support full model execution on
VGG-16. Our profiling reveals high PE utilization (over 90%), significant fold
reuse, and scalable throughput up to 1.56 TFLOPs/sec and 12.7 KIPS for
end-to-end VGG-16 inference. These results validate the efficacy of our
approach in minimizing control overhead, improving data locality, and enabling
efficient large-scale convolution execution without reliance on conventional
transformation-based methods.

*Khalid Hasan,Jamil Saquer,Mukulika Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates transformer-based NLP models and LSTM approaches for mental health disorder classification on Reddit, with RoBERTa achieving the best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for automated tools in detecting and monitoring mental health disorders, leveraging advances in NLP.

Method: Comparison of transformer models (e.g., RoBERTa, BERT, ELECTRA) and LSTM models with various text embeddings, using a large annotated dataset and statistical/analytical techniques.

Result: RoBERTa achieved the highest F1 scores (99.54% on hold-out test set and 96.05% on external test set), outperforming LSTM-based models, although the latter performed well with BERT embeddings.

Conclusion: Transformer-based models, particularly RoBERTa, are highly effective for scalable and real-time mental health monitoring, while LSTM models remain computationally efficient alternatives.

Abstract: The rising prevalence of mental health disorders necessitates the development
of robust, automated tools for early detection and monitoring. Recent advances
in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly transformer-based
architectures, have demonstrated significant potential in text analysis. This
study provides a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art transformer
models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, ALBERT, and ELECTRA) against Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) based approaches using different text embedding techniques for
mental health disorder classification on Reddit. We construct a large annotated
dataset, validating its reliability through statistical judgmental analysis and
topic modeling. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of
transformer models over traditional deep-learning approaches. RoBERTa achieved
the highest classification performance, with a 99.54% F1 score on the hold-out
test set and a 96.05% F1 score on the external test set. Notably, LSTM models
augmented with BERT embeddings proved highly competitive, achieving F1 scores
exceeding 94% on the external dataset while requiring significantly fewer
computational resources. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
transformer-based models for real-time, scalable mental health monitoring. We
discuss the implications for clinical applications and digital mental health
interventions, offering insights into the capabilities and limitations of
state-of-the-art NLP methodologies in mental disorder detection.

*Vishakh Padmakumar,Joseph Chee Chang,Kyle Lo,Doug Downey,Aakanksha Naik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in schema generation for organizing academic literature, improving evaluation ambiguity and introducing editing techniques using LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The volume of academic literature necessitates tools to better organize and compare documents, addressing ambiguity in schema evaluations and the lack of refinement methods.

Method: The study creates a dataset with synthesized intents for schema generation and evaluates various LLMs, proposing techniques for schema generation and refinement.

Result: Incorporating table intents improves performance in schema reconstruction; fine-tuned smaller models become competitive with state-of-the-art LLMs, with additional editing methods enhancing results.

Conclusion: The work advances schema generation for comparing academic papers, reducing ambiguity, and enhancing performance through novel dataset creation and editing techniques.

Abstract: The increasing volume of academic literature makes it essential for
researchers to organize, compare, and contrast collections of documents. Large
language models (LLMs) can support this process by generating schemas defining
shared aspects along which to compare papers. However, progress on schema
generation has been slow due to: (i) ambiguity in reference-based evaluations,
and (ii) lack of editing/refinement methods. Our work is the first to address
both issues. First, we present an approach for augmenting unannotated table
corpora with synthesized intents and apply it to create a dataset for studying
schema generation conditioned on a given information need, thus reducing
ambiguity. With this dataset, we show how incorporating table intents
significantly improves baseline performance in reconstructing reference
schemas. Next, we propose several LLM-based schema editing techniques. We start
by comprehensively benchmarking several single-shot schema generation methods,
including prompted LLM workflows and fine-tuned models, showing that smaller,
open-weight models can be fine-tuned to be competitive with state-of-the-art
prompted LLMs. Then we demonstrate that our editing techniques can further
improve schemas generated by these methods.

TL;DR: WOKIE is an open-source pipeline that facilitates automated, high-quality, and cost-effective translation of SKOS thesauri, leveraging external services and Large Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of language diversity restricting access, reuse, and interoperability of knowledge resources in Digital Humanities.

Method: Utilizes modular architecture combining external translation services and refinement by Large Language Models, with systematic evaluation against DH thesauri in 15 languages.

Result: Demonstrates improved translation quality, scalability, accessibility and enhanced ontology matching performance in multilingual context.

Conclusion: WOKIE aids the development of inclusive and multilingual research infrastructures by overcoming translation barriers and fostering semantic interoperability in DH.

Abstract: We introduce WOKIE, an open-source, modular, and ready-to-use pipeline for
the automated translation of SKOS thesauri. This work addresses a critical need
in the Digital Humanities (DH), where language diversity can limit access,
reuse, and semantic interoperability of knowledge resources. WOKIE combines
external translation services with targeted refinement using Large Language
Models (LLMs), balancing translation quality, scalability, and cost. Designed
to run on everyday hardware and be easily extended, the application requires no
prior expertise in machine translation or LLMs. We evaluate WOKIE across
several DH thesauri in 15 languages with different parameters, translation
services and LLMs, systematically analysing translation quality, performance,
and ontology matching improvements. Our results show that WOKIE is suitable to
enhance the accessibility, reuse, and cross-lingual interoperability of
thesauri by hurdle-free automated translation and improved ontology matching
performance, supporting more inclusive and multilingual research
infrastructures.

### [60] [Mitigating Geospatial Knowledge Hallucination in Large Language Models: Benchmarking and Dynamic Factuality Aligning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19586)
*Shengyuan Wang,Jie Feng,Tianhui Liu,Dan Pei,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of geospatial hallucinations (factually incorrect geospatial information) in large language models (LLMs), introduces a benchmark to evaluate these hallucinations, and proposes a mitigation method based on Kahneman-Tversky Optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geospatial hallucinations in LLMs undermine their reliability in tasks requiring accurate geospatial reasoning and knowledge. Existing studies on general hallucinations don't adequately address this issue.

Method: The paper proposes a benchmark leveraging structured geospatial knowledge graphs to systematically evaluate geospatial hallucinations. It also introduces a dynamic factuality alignment method using Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to reduce such hallucinations.

Result: Extensive evaluations of 20 advanced LLMs reveal prevalent geospatial hallucinations in their knowledge. The proposed KTO method reduces these hallucinations, improving performance by over 29.6% on the benchmark.

Conclusion: The paper enhances the trustworthiness of LLMs in geospatial tasks by providing an effective evaluation framework and mitigation strategy. This approach shows significant potential for improving the factual accuracy of LLMs regarding geospatial information.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive world knowledge, including
geospatial knowledge, which has been successfully applied to various geospatial
tasks such as mobility prediction and social indicator prediction. However,
LLMs often generate inaccurate geospatial knowledge, leading to geospatial
hallucinations (incorrect or inconsistent representations of geospatial
information) that compromise their reliability. While the phenomenon of general
knowledge hallucination in LLMs has been widely studied, the systematic
evaluation and mitigation of geospatial hallucinations remain largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive evaluation
framework for geospatial hallucinations, leveraging structured geospatial
knowledge graphs for controlled assessment. Through extensive evaluation across
20 advanced LLMs, we uncover the hallucinations in their geospatial knowledge.
Building on these insights, we introduce a dynamic factuality aligning method
based on Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to mitigate geospatial
hallucinations in LLMs, leading to a performance improvement of over 29.6% on
the proposed benchmark. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our benchmark and learning algorithm in enhancing the
trustworthiness of LLMs in geospatial knowledge and reasoning tasks.

*Yutao Sun,Zhenyu Li,Yike Zhang,Tengyu Pan,Bowen Dong,Yuyi Guo,Jianyong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper surveys efficient attention mechanisms for large language models to mitigate self-attention's high complexity, focusing on linear and sparse attention methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of quadratic time and memory complexity in self-attention for long-context modeling in large language models.

Method: The study systematically categorizes and evaluates efficient attention approaches, integrates algorithmic advancements and hardware considerations, and examines their application in large-scale pre-trained language models.

Result: Efficient attention mechanisms, both linear and sparse, are highlighted as viable solutions for reducing computational overhead while maintaining contextual understanding.

Conclusion: This survey serves as a foundational reference to guide the design and deployment of scalable and efficient language models leveraging advancements in efficient attention methods.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have become the prevailing backbone of large
language models. However, the quadratic time and memory complexity of
self-attention remains a fundamental obstacle to efficient long-context
modeling. To address this limitation, recent research has introduced two
principal categories of efficient attention mechanisms. Linear attention
methods achieve linear complexity through kernel approximations, recurrent
formulations, or fastweight dynamics, thereby enabling scalable inference with
reduced computational overhead. Sparse attention techniques, in contrast, limit
attention computation to selected subsets of tokens based on fixed patterns,
block-wise routing, or clustering strategies, enhancing efficiency while
preserving contextual coverage. This survey provides a systematic and
comprehensive overview of these developments, integrating both algorithmic
innovations and hardware-level considerations. In addition, we analyze the
incorporation of efficient attention into largescale pre-trained language
models, including both architectures built entirely on efficient attention and
hybrid designs that combine local and global components. By aligning
theoretical foundations with practical deployment strategies, this work aims to
serve as a foundational reference for advancing the design of scalable and
efficient language models.

*Muntasir Wahed,Xiaona Zhou,Kiet A. Nguyen,Tianjiao Yu,Nirav Diwan,Gang Wang,Dilek Hakkani-Tür,Ismini Lourentzou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the vulnerabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating malicious code, especially under multi-turn conversational attacks. It proposes a benchmark (MOCHA) to evaluate robustness and offers fine-tuning techniques to improve rejection rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the concern of adversarial misuse in LLMs for generating malicious code, particularly through multi-turn conversational prompts, and to assess their robustness systematically.

Method: The authors introduce 'code decomposition attacks,' which break malicious coding prompts into benign subtasks across multiple conversations. They also develop a benchmark (MOCHA) for evaluating the robustness of LLMs against these attacks and fine-tune models to improve rejection rates.

Result: Empirical results highlight persistent vulnerabilities in both open- and closed-source models, especially in multi-turn scenarios. Fine-tuning on MOCHA increases robustness with up to 32.4% higher rejection rates on external adversarial datasets, without additional supervision.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning on the MOCHA benchmark enhances the robustness of LLMs against adversarial misuse, addressing vulnerabilities in generating malicious code without compromising overall coding capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
enhanced their code generation capabilities. However, their robustness against
adversarial misuse, particularly through multi-turn malicious coding prompts,
remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce code decomposition attacks,
where a malicious coding task is broken down into a series of seemingly benign
subtasks across multiple conversational turns to evade safety filters. To
facilitate systematic evaluation, we introduce \benchmarkname{}, a large-scale
benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of code LLMs against both
single-turn and multi-turn malicious prompts. Empirical results across open-
and closed-source models reveal persistent vulnerabilities, especially under
multi-turn scenarios. Fine-tuning on MOCHA improves rejection rates while
preserving coding ability, and importantly, enhances robustness on external
adversarial datasets with up to 32.4% increase in rejection rates without any
additional supervision.

*Xuchen Wei,Yangxin Wu,Yaoyin Zhang,Henglyu Liu,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an end-to-end system combining Whisper ASR and Krutrim LLM to improve low-resource speech-to-text translation in English-Indic pairs, achieving average BLEU scores of 28.88 (English-to-Indic) and 27.86 (Indic-to-English).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address low-resource speech-to-text translation challenges between English and Indic languages, enhancing translation quality in these language pairs.

Method: The authors propose integrating the pre-trained Whisper ASR model with Krutrim LLM for speech-to-text translation. They also explored the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method for potential quality improvements.

Result: The system achieved average BLEU scores of 28.88 for English-to-Indic and 27.86 for Indic-to-English translations. Chain-of-Thought improved translation quality significantly in some cases (e.g., Tamil-to-English saw a 13.84 BLEU increase) but faced consistency challenges.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively improves translation quality in low-resource settings, but further work is needed to address consistency issues in techniques like Chain-of-Thought.

Abstract: This paper presents HITSZ's submission for the IWSLT 2025 Indic track,
focusing on speech-to-text translation (ST) for English-to-Indic and
Indic-to-English language pairs. To enhance translation quality in this
low-resource scenario, we propose an end-to-end system integrating the
pre-trained Whisper automated speech recognition (ASR) model with Krutrim, an
Indic-specialized large language model (LLM). Experimental results demonstrate
that our end-to-end system achieved average BLEU scores of $28.88$ for
English-to-Indic directions and $27.86$ for Indic-to-English directions.
Furthermore, we investigated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method. While this
method showed potential for significant translation quality improvements on
successfully parsed outputs (e.g. a $13.84$ BLEU increase for
Tamil-to-English), we observed challenges in ensuring the model consistently
adheres to the required CoT output format.

*Sara Papi,Maike Züfle,Marco Gaido,Beatrice Savoldi,Danni Liu,Ioannis Douros,Luisa Bentivogli,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MCIF, a benchmark to evaluate multilingual and multimodal capabilities of large language models using human-annotated scientific talks in English, German, Italian, and Chinese across speech, vision, and text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for comprehensive benchmarks to assess multimodal and multilingual instruction-following abilities of large language models, as existing benchmarks focus on monolingual, single-modality, or short-context tasks.

Method: The authors created MCIF, a human-annotated benchmark that spans speech, vision, and text modalities in four languages, allowing evaluation of models on crosslingual, multimodal, short-, and long-context instructions.

Result: MCIF provides the first multilingual, multimodal benchmark for instruction-following tasks using diverse inputs and languages. It bridges gaps in existing evaluation methods.

Conclusion: MCIF enables a thorough evaluation platform for multimodal LLMs, supporting progress in the development of general-purpose instruction-following models in multilingual and multimodal settings.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have catalyzed the development of
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that integrate text, speech, and vision within unified
frameworks. As MLLMs evolve from narrow, monolingual, task-specific systems to
general-purpose instruction-following models, a key frontier lies in evaluating
their multilingual and multimodal capabilities over both long and short
contexts. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these
dimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on one
single modality at a time, rely on short-form contexts, or lack human
annotations -- hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across
languages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce
MCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first multilingual
human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks that is designed to
evaluate instruction-following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over both
short- and long-form inputs. MCIF spans three core modalities -- speech,
vision, and text -- and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and
Chinese), enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret
instructions across languages and combine them with multimodal contextual
information. MCIF is released under a CC-BY 4.0 license to encourage open
research and progress in MLLMs development.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in understanding Romanian driving law through textual and visual tasks. It introduces a new dataset and assesses various AI techniques for these purposes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for AI-based tools that assist in legal education, specifically in under-resourced languages like Romanian, with a focus on driving law.

Method: The researchers introduced RoD-TAL, a new multimodal dataset containing Romanian driving test materials. They implemented retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, dense retrievers, and reasoning-optimized models to evaluate tasks like Information Retrieval (IR), Question Answering (QA), Visual IR, and Visual QA.

Result: Domain-specific fine-tuning improved model retrieval performance, and chain-of-thought prompting enhanced QA accuracy to exceed passing thresholds for exams. However, visual reasoning tasks proved challenging.

Conclusion: While LLMs and VLMs show promise for legal education, particularly for text-based tasks, there are limitations, especially in visual reasoning, that suggest room for further improvement.

Abstract: The intersection of AI and legal systems presents a growing need for tools
that support legal education, particularly in under-resourced languages such as
Romanian. In this work, we aim to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in understanding and reasoning
about Romanian driving law through textual and visual question-answering tasks.
To facilitate this, we introduce RoD-TAL, a novel multimodal dataset comprising
Romanian driving test questions, text-based and image-based, alongside
annotated legal references and human explanations. We implement and assess
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, dense retrievers, and
reasoning-optimized models across tasks including Information Retrieval (IR),
Question Answering (QA), Visual IR, and Visual QA. Our experiments demonstrate
that domain-specific fine-tuning significantly enhances retrieval performance.
At the same time, chain-of-thought prompting and specialized reasoning models
improve QA accuracy, surpassing the minimum grades required to pass driving
exams. However, visual reasoning remains challenging, highlighting the
potential and the limitations of applying LLMs and VLMs to legal education.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates multilingual and monolingual LLMs for Arabic, English, and Indic languages, exploring the impacts of linguistic diversity, resource availability, and compression techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the performance of LLMs for low-resource languages like Kannada and Arabic and benchmark model effectiveness across languages.

Method: Performance benchmarks were conducted on LLMs (such as BLOOMZ, AceGPT, and LLaMA-2) across multiple languages using model compression strategies like pruning and quantization.

Result: Multilingual models exhibited better performance due to cross-lingual transfer. Quantization maintained accuracy while improving efficiency, while aggressive pruning impaired performance, especially in larger models.

Conclusion: Key strategies for scalable multilingual NLP were identified, including addressing hallucination and generalization errors in low-resource contexts.

Abstract: Although LLMs have attained significant success in high-resource languages,
their capacity in low-resource linguistic environments like Kannada and Arabic
is not yet fully understood. This work benchmarking the performance of
multilingual and monolingual Large Language Models (LLMs) across Arabic,
English, and Indic languages, with particular emphasis on the effects of model
compression strategies such as pruning and quantization. Findings shows
significant performance differences driven by linguistic diversity and resource
availability on SOTA LLMS as BLOOMZ, AceGPT, Jais, LLaMA-2, XGLM, and AraGPT2.
We find that multilingual versions of the model outperform their
language-specific counterparts across the board, indicating substantial
cross-lingual transfer benefits. Quantization (4-bit and 8-bit) is effective in
maintaining model accuracy while promoting efficiency, but aggressive pruning
significantly compromises performance, especially in bigger models. Our
findings pinpoint key strategies to construct scalable and fair multilingual
NLP solutions and underscore the need for interventions to address
hallucination and generalization errors in the low-resource setting.

*Ronak Upasham,Tathagata Dey,Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel pipeline for Table-to-Text (T2T) generation, incorporating both objective and subjective interpretations, achieving strong performance compared to large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the underexploration of generating subjective text—interpreted data beyond raw numbers—in traditional T2T generation methods, which mainly focus on objective descriptions.

Method: The authors propose a three-stage pipeline: (1) extraction of RDF triples to ensure factual accuracy, (2) narrative aggregation for text coherence, and (3) subjectivity infusion to enhance interpretative richness.

Result: The pipeline, using fine-tuned smaller T5 models, performs comparably to GPT-3.5 and surpasses other models like Mistral-7B and Llama-2 on several metrics, effectively combining factual correctness with subjective depth.

Conclusion: The work pioneers the integration of intermediate representations in T2T generation and demonstrates a meaningful balance between factual accuracy and subjective interpretation, contributing a novel structured approach to the field.

Abstract: In Table-to-Text (T2T) generation, existing approaches predominantly focus on
providing objective descriptions of tabular data. However, generating text that
incorporates subjectivity, where subjectivity refers to interpretations beyond
raw numerical data, remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce a
novel pipeline that leverages intermediate representations to generate both
objective and subjective text from tables. Our three-stage pipeline consists
of: 1) extraction of Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples, 2)
aggregation of text into coherent narratives, and 3) infusion of subjectivity
to enrich the generated text. By incorporating RDFs, our approach enhances
factual accuracy while maintaining interpretability. Unlike large language
models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5, Mistral-7B, and Llama-2, our pipeline employs
smaller, fine-tuned T5 models while achieving comparable performance to GPT-3.5
and outperforming Mistral-7B and Llama-2 in several metrics. We evaluate our
approach through quantitative and qualitative analyses, demonstrating its
effectiveness in balancing factual accuracy with subjective interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a structured
pipeline for T2T generation that integrates intermediate representations to
enhance both factual correctness and subjectivity.

*Zhi Zhou,Sirui Miao,Xiangyu Duan,Hao Yang,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study proposes Basic Reading Distillation (BRD), a novel training method for small models to mimic LLMs' basic reading behaviors, achieving competitive performance with far smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) require high computational resources, making their deployment infeasible for many real-world applications. Existing distillation techniques fail to teach generic, task-agnostic reading capabilities to smaller models.

Method: The authors introduce Basic Reading Distillation (BRD), where small models are trained to imitate LLMs' foundational reading tasks (e.g., named entity recognition, question answering) on generic, unrelated texts.

Result: Small models trained with BRD perform as well as or better than LLMs over 20 times their size on various tasks, such as language inference and BIG-bench benchmarks.

Conclusion: BRD effectively enhances smaller models by teaching them foundational reading behaviors, proving orthogonal to traditional knowledge or task-specific distillation methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in
various natural language processing areas, but they demand high computation
resources which limits their deployment in real-world. Distillation is one
technique to solve this problem through either knowledge distillation or task
distillation. Both distillation approaches train small models to imitate
specific features of LLMs, but they all neglect basic reading education for
small models on generic texts that are \emph{unrelated} to downstream tasks. In
this paper, we propose basic reading distillation (BRD) which educates a small
model to imitate LLMs basic reading behaviors, such as named entity
recognition, question raising and answering, on each sentence. After such basic
education, we apply the small model on various tasks including language
inference benchmarks and BIG-bench tasks. It shows that the small model can
outperform or perform comparable to over 20x bigger LLMs. Analysis reveals that
BRD effectively influences the probability distribution of the small model, and
has orthogonality to either knowledge distillation or task distillation.

TL;DR: JT-Math-8B introduces a new class of open-source Large Language Models specifically tailored for complex mathematical reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance in its category.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of current Large Language Models, which struggle with deep conceptual understanding and multi-step reasoning in complex mathematical problems.

Method: The authors developed JT-Math-8B through a multi-stage optimization process, involving a 210B-token dataset curated via model-based validation. It includes three model versions—base, instruct, and thinking—each fine-tuned with methods like supervised learning and reinforcement learning (SFT, GRPO, and multi-stage RL), particularly emphasizing sophisticated reasoning with Long CoT and extended context lengths up to 32K tokens.

Result: JT-Math-8B outperforms other open-source models of similar size, notably surpassing OpenAI’s O1-mini and GPT-4o in competition-level mathematics.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that a systematic optimization framework and dedicated training schemes can significantly enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of open-source models, pushing their performance closer to state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a cornerstone of artificial general intelligence
and a primary benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). While state-of-the-art models show promise, they often falter
when faced with complex problems that demand deep conceptual understanding and
intricate, multi-step deliberation. To address this challenge, we introduce
JT-Math-8B, a series of open-source models comprising base, instruct, and
thinking versions, built upon a systematic, multi-stage optimization framework.
Our pre-training corpus is a high-quality, 210B-token dataset curated through a
dedicated data pipeline that uses model-based validation to ensure quality and
diversity. The Instruct Model is optimized for direct, concise answers through
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and a GRPO-based reinforcement learning (RL)
method. The Thinking Model is trained for complex problem-solving using a Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) approach, combining SFT with a novel, multi-stage
RL curriculum that progressively increases task difficulty and context length
up to 32K tokens. JT-Math-8B achieves state-of-the-art results among
open-source models of similar size, surpassing prominent models like OpenAI's
O1-mini and GPT-4o , and demonstrating superior performance on
competition-level mathematics.

*Rebecca M. M. Hicke,Brian Haggard,Mia Ferrante,Rayhan Khanna,David Mimno*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study computationally explores Christian Fiction, focusing on mentions of divine acts and identifying differences between the Left Behind series and the general Christian Fiction genre, as well as gender-based authorial contrasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of scholarly attention to Christian Fiction (apart from the Left Behind series) and better understand its cultural and literary dimensions, particularly in the depiction of divine acts.

Method: Human annotators developed a codebook for identifying 'acts of God,' and a lightweight language model (LM) was trained, with assistance from a larger model, to annotate texts. Both human and model performance were compared.

Result: The lightweight LM matched human annotation quality on the challenging task and highlighted meaningful differences in the depiction of divine acts across the general Christian Fiction genre and the Left Behind books, as well as between male and female authors.

Conclusion: Computational tools successfully reveal previously unexplored dimensions of Christian Fiction, showcasing the genre's diversity and the nuanced ways divine acts are represented across different subdivisions and authorial identities.

Abstract: In addition to its more widely studied political activities, the American
Evangelical movement has a well-developed but less externally visible cultural
and literary side. Christian Fiction, however, has been little studied, and
what scholarly attention there is has focused on the explosively popular Left
Behind series. In this work, we use computational tools to provide both a broad
topical overview of Christian Fiction as a genre and a more directed
exploration of how its authors depict divine acts. Working with human
annotators we first developed definitions and a codebook for "acts of God." We
then adapted those instructions designed for human annotators for use by a
recent, lightweight LM with the assistance of a much larger model. The
laptop-scale LM is capable of matching human annotations, even when the task is
subtle and challenging. Using these annotations, we show that significant and
meaningful differences exist between the Left Behind books and Christian
Fiction more broadly and between books by male and female authors.

*Dong Du,Shulin Liu,Tao Yang,Shaohua Chen,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement Learning (UloRL) to improve the reasoning of large language models (LLMs) by addressing inefficiencies in handling ultra-long outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL frameworks struggle with inefficiencies in training LLMs on ultra-long outputs due to challenges like long-tail sequence distributions and entropy collapse.

Method: The UloRL approach divides ultra-long output decoding into shorter segments and uses dynamic masking to mitigate entropy collapse, enabling more efficient training.

Result: Using the Qwen3-30B-A3B model, UloRL achieved a 2.06x increase in training speed and notable improvements in test performance, surpassing even larger models like Qwen3-235B-A22B.

Conclusion: The UloRL approach effectively enhances LLM reasoning capabilities for ultra-long sequences, showcasing its potential for advancing LLM performance. The code and models will be shared with the community.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the
potential of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to enhance
reasoning capabilities through extended output sequences. However, traditional
RL frameworks face inefficiencies when handling ultra-long outputs due to
long-tail sequence distributions and entropy collapse during training. To
address these challenges, we propose an Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement
Learning (UloRL) approach for advancing large language models' reasoning
abilities. Specifically, we divide ultra long output decoding into short
segments, enabling efficient training by mitigating delays caused by long-tail
samples. Additionally, we introduce dynamic masking of well-Mastered Positive
Tokens (MPTs) to prevent entropy collapse. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. On the Qwen3-30B-A3B model, RL with segment
rollout achieved 2.06x increase in training speed, while RL training with
128k-token outputs improves the model's performance on AIME2025 from 70.9\% to
85.1\% and on BeyondAIME from 50.7\% to 61.9\%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B
with remarkable gains. These findings underscore the potential of our methods
to advance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with ultra-long sequence
generation. We will release our code and model for further use by the
community.

### [72] [Flora: Effortless Context Construction to Arbitrary Length and Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19786)
*Tianxiang Chen,Zhentao Tan,Xiaofan Bo,Yue Wu,Tao Gong,Qi Chu,Jieping Ye,Nenghai Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Flora, a strategy for constructing long-context data for LLMs without human or LLM intervention, enabling performance improvements in long-context tasks while preserving short-context capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with long-context handling due to resource constraints, lower availability of long-text data, and loss in short-context performance when tuned for long contexts.

Method: Flora constructs long-context data by combining short instructions into categories and using meta-instructions to prompt LLMs to generate responses for diverse and scalable contexts.

Result: Experiments on Llama3-8B-Instruct and QwQ-32B demonstrate that Flora improves LLM performance in long-context benchmarks while maintaining short-context effectiveness.

Conclusion: Flora offers an effortless and scalable way to enhance LLM capability with long contexts, addressing limitations of existing manual or LLM-intensive methods.

Abstract: Effectively handling long contexts is challenging for Large Language Models
(LLMs) due to the rarity of long texts, high computational demands, and
substantial forgetting of short-context abilities. Recent approaches have
attempted to construct long contexts for instruction tuning, but these methods
often require LLMs or human interventions, which are both costly and limited in
length and diversity. Also, the drop in short-context performances of present
long-context LLMs remains significant. In this paper, we introduce Flora, an
effortless (human/LLM-free) long-context construction strategy. Flora can
markedly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs by arbitrarily assembling
short instructions based on categories and instructing LLMs to generate
responses based on long-context meta-instructions. This enables Flora to
produce contexts of arbitrary length and scale with rich diversity, while only
slightly compromising short-context performance. Experiments on
Llama3-8B-Instruct and QwQ-32B show that LLMs enhanced by Flora excel in three
long-context benchmarks while maintaining strong performances in short-context
tasks. Our data-construction code is available at

*Dongquan Yang,Yifan Yang,Xiaotian Yu,Xianbiao Qi,Rong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HCAttention is a new method that efficiently compresses the memory footprint of Key-Value caches in large language models without compromising accuracy, achieving competitive performance even at extreme memory reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of processing long-context inputs with large language models, which require substantial memory for Key-Value caches, often becoming impractical under extreme memory constraints.

Method: HCAttention combines key quantization, value offloading, and dynamic Key-Value eviction into a heterogeneous attention computation framework that requires no model fine-tuning and integrates seamlessly into existing transformer models.

Result: Experimental evaluations on LongBench show that HCAttention maintains full-attention model accuracy with only 25% of the original Key-Value cache memory and remains competitive with just 12.5%. It also enables the Llama-3-8B model to handle 4 million tokens on a single A100 GPU with 80GB memory for the first time.

Conclusion: HCAttention sets a new standard in Key-Value cache compression for large language models, offering a high-efficiency solution to memory constraints while preserving performance and compatibility.

Abstract: Processing long-context inputs with large language models presents a
significant challenge due to the enormous memory requirements of the Key-Value
(KV) cache during inference. Existing KV cache compression methods exhibit
noticeable performance degradation when memory is reduced by more than 85%.
Additionally, strategies that leverage GPU-CPU collaboration for approximate
attention remain underexplored in this setting. We propose HCAttention, a
heterogeneous attention computation framework that integrates key quantization,
value offloading, and dynamic KV eviction to enable efficient inference under
extreme memory constraints. The method is compatible with existing transformer
architectures and does not require model fine-tuning. Experimental results on
the LongBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach preserves the accuracy of
full-attention model while shrinking the KV cache memory footprint to 25% of
its original size. Remarkably, it stays competitive with only 12.5% of the
cache, setting a new state-of-the-art in LLM KV cache compression. To the best
of our knowledge, HCAttention is the first to extend the Llama-3-8B model to
process 4 million tokens on a single A100 GPU with 80GB memory.

*Anshul Chavda,M Jagadeesh,Chintalapalli Raja Kullayappa,B Jayaprakash,Medchalimi Sruthi,Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The authors present DiscoDrive, a synthetic dataset of in-car dialogs that dynamically integrates disfluencies to improve its usage in autonomous vehicles. Tests show that it improves conversational AI models both as a training and data augmentation resource.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conversational AI datasets do not effectively capture real-world disfluencies such as hesitations, repetitions, and self-corrections, which are critical in the context of driver-AI dialogs.

Method: DiscoDrive employs a two-stage, prompt-driven pipeline for dialog synthesis, dynamically introducing disfluencies during generation. It covers 3500 dialogs across seven automotive domains.

Result: Models trained with or augmented by DiscoDrive outperform those trained with existing resources like KVRET on multiple benchmarks (MultiWOZ 2.2, SGD test sets) and human evaluations, achieving higher scores in metrics like BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and BERTScore F1.

Conclusion: DiscoDrive fills a gap in conversational AI resources for handling disfluent in-car interactions, improving naturalness, coherence, and context-appropriateness in dialog systems, making it a valuable tool.

Abstract: In-car conversational AI is becoming increasingly critical as autonomous
vehicles and smart assistants gain widespread adoption. Yet, existing datasets
fail to capture the spontaneous disfluencies such as hesitations, false starts,
repetitions, and self-corrections that characterize real driver-AI dialogs. To
address this, we introduce DiscoDrive, a synthetic corpus of 3500 multi-turn
dialogs across seven automotive domains, generated using a two-stage,
prompt-driven pipeline that dynamically integrates disfluencies during
synthesis. We show that DiscoDrive is effective both as a training resource,
enabling DialoGPT-Medium and T5-Base to match or exceed KVRET-trained models on
the MultiWOZ 2.2 and Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) relevant test sets (BLEU-4
improvements of 0.26 to 0.61; METEOR +2.10; ROUGE-L +3.48; BERTScore F1
improvements of 1.35 to 3.48), and as a data augmentation resource in
low-resource scenarios, delivering additional gains of up to BLEU-4 +0.38,
METEOR +1.95, ROUGE-L +2.87, and BERTScore F1 +4.00 when combined with 10
percent of KVRET. Human evaluations further confirm that dialogs sampled from
DiscoDrive are rated higher than KVRET's human-collected dialogs in naturalness
(3.8 vs 3.6) and coherence (4.1 vs 4.0), and are perceived as more
context-appropriate than leading post-hoc methods (such as LARD), without
compromising clarity. DiscoDrive fills a critical gap in existing resources and
serves as a versatile corpus for both training and augmenting conversational
AI, enabling robust handling of real-world, disfluent in-car interactions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates 6 LLMs and 4 MLLMs on Brazilian Portuguese medical exam questions, identifying disparities in accuracy and multimodal performance while underscoring the need for language-specific AI enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address biases and limitations of LLMs and MLLMs in non-English medical applications, specifically in Brazilian Portuguese, to provide equitable AI-driven healthcare solutions.

Method: Six LLMs and four MLLMs were tested using medical exam questions from HCFMUSP. Their performance was benchmarked against human candidates using metrics such as accuracy, processing time, and explanation coherence.

Result: LLMs like Claude-3.5-Sonnet and Claude-3-Opus achieved human-level accuracy but struggled with multimodal questions requiring image interpretation and showed language biases.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning and dataset augmentation are needed for non-English applications. Multimodal reasoning and clinical integration must improve for AI's equitable implementation in global healthcare settings.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown the potential to revolutionize
healthcare by improving diagnostic accuracy, optimizing workflows, and
personalizing treatment plans. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable advancements in natural
language processing and medical applications. However, the evaluation of these
models has focused predominantly on the English language, leading to potential
biases in their performance across different languages.
  This study investigates the capability of six LLMs (GPT-4.0 Turbo,
LLaMA-3-8B, LLaMA-3-70B, Mixtral 8x7B Instruct, Titan Text G1-Express, and
Command R+) and four MLLMs (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3-Opus, Claude-3-Sonnet,
and Claude-3-Haiku) to answer questions written in Brazilian spoken portuguese
from the medical residency entrance exam of the Hospital das Cl\'inicas da
Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S\~ao Paulo (HCFMUSP) - the largest
health complex in South America. The performance of the models was benchmarked
against human candidates, analyzing accuracy, processing time, and coherence of
the generated explanations.
  The results show that while some models, particularly Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
Claude-3-Opus, achieved accuracy levels comparable to human candidates,
performance gaps persist, particularly in multimodal questions requiring image
interpretation. Furthermore, the study highlights language disparities,
emphasizing the need for further fine-tuning and data set augmentation for
non-English medical AI applications.
  Our findings reinforce the importance of evaluating generative AI in various
linguistic and clinical settings to ensure a fair and reliable deployment in
healthcare. Future research should explore improved training methodologies,
improved multimodal reasoning, and real-world clinical integration of AI-driven
medical assistance.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 on their ability to analyze social media posts for depression, using a detailed expert-annotated dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve early detection of depression through social media and evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in generating clinically meaningful explanations.

Method: A high-quality dataset of 1,017 annotated posts was created, with fine-grained labels covering depressive spans and symptoms. The LLMs were assessed through zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies.

Result: LLMs like GPT-4 showed significant performance differences when predicting clinical explanations. Human expertise was key in improving their behaviors.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of integrating human expertise to create safer, more transparent AI systems for mental health.

Abstract: Early detection of depression from online social media posts holds promise
for providing timely mental health interventions. In this work, we present a
high-quality, expert-annotated dataset of 1,017 social media posts labeled with
depressive spans and mapped to 12 depression symptom categories. Unlike prior
datasets that primarily offer coarse post-level labels
\cite{cohan-etal-2018-smhd}, our dataset enables fine-grained evaluation of
both model predictions and generated explanations.
  We develop an evaluation framework that leverages this clinically grounded
dataset to assess the faithfulness and quality of natural language explanations
generated by large language models (LLMs). Through carefully designed prompting
strategies, including zero-shot and few-shot approaches with domain-adapted
examples, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs including GPT-4.1,
Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet.
  Our comprehensive empirical analysis reveals significant differences in how
these models perform on clinical explanation tasks, with zero-shot and few-shot
prompting. Our findings underscore the value of human expertise in guiding LLM
behavior and offer a step toward safer, more transparent AI systems for
psychological well-being.

### [78] [CaliDrop: KV Cache Compression with Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19906)
*Yi Su,Quantong Qiu,Yuechi Zhou,Juntao Li,Qingrong Xia,Ping Li,Xinyu Duan,Zhefeng Wang,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CaliDrop, a calibrated token eviction strategy to better manage memory usage in Large Language Models without significant accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Token eviction for compressing KV cache in LLMs often compromises accuracy. The paper seeks to address this issue by proposing a better strategy.

Method: The proposed method, CaliDrop, employs speculative calibration on discarded tokens to reduce accuracy degradation caused by token eviction.

Result: CaliDrop notably enhances the accuracy of existing token eviction methods as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: CaliDrop offers an effective solution for improving token eviction-induced memory management in LLMs, ensuring minimal trade-offs in accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources
during generation. While the Key-Value (KV) cache significantly accelerates
this process by storing attention intermediates, its memory footprint grows
linearly with sequence length, batch size, and model size, creating a
bottleneck in long-context scenarios. Various KV cache compression techniques,
including token eviction, quantization, and low-rank projection, have been
proposed to mitigate this bottleneck, often complementing each other. This
paper focuses on enhancing token eviction strategies. Token eviction leverages
the observation that the attention patterns are often sparse, allowing for the
removal of less critical KV entries to save memory. However, this reduction
usually comes at the cost of notable accuracy degradation, particularly under
high compression ratios. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{CaliDrop}, a
novel strategy that enhances token eviction through calibration. Our
preliminary experiments show that queries at nearby positions exhibit high
similarity. Building on this observation, CaliDrop performs speculative
calibration on the discarded tokens to mitigate the accuracy loss caused by
token eviction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CaliDrop significantly
improves the accuracy of existing token eviction methods.

Result: KLAAD demonstrates superior bias mitigation performance on BBQ and BOLD benchmarks, showing minimal degradation in language modeling quality.

Conclusion: Aligning attention distributions is an effective strategy for bias mitigation in LLMs, as shown by KLAAD's success in reducing bias while maintaining generative performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit societal biases in their outputs,
prompting ethical concerns regarding fairness and harm. In this work, we
propose KLAAD (KL-Attention Alignment Debiasing), an attention-based debiasing
framework that implicitly aligns attention distributions between stereotypical
and anti-stereotypical sentence pairs without directly modifying model weights.
KLAAD introduces a composite training objective combining Cross-Entropy, KL
divergence, and Triplet losses, guiding the model to consistently attend across
biased and unbiased contexts while preserving fluency and coherence.
Experimental evaluation of KLAAD demonstrates improved bias mitigation on both
the BBQ and BOLD benchmarks, with minimal impact on language modeling quality.
The results indicate that attention-level alignment offers a principled
solution for mitigating bias in generative language models.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of a comprehensive benchmark for rigorously evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs) to generate visualizations from natural language input.

Method: The authors created Text2Vis, a benchmark with 1,985 samples, covering diverse queries and visualization types. They benchmarked 11 models and introduced a cross-modal actor-critic framework for improved performance. An automated LLM-based evaluation framework was also devised to scale assessment effectively.

Conclusion: Text2Vis provides a critical evaluation tool for text-to-visualization models, identifies current limitations, and suggests methods for improvement. It is publicly available for further research and development in this domain.

Abstract: Automated data visualization plays a crucial role in simplifying data
interpretation, enhancing decision-making, and improving efficiency. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating visualizations
from natural language, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks limits the
rigorous evaluation of their capabilities. We introduce Text2Vis, a benchmark
designed to assess text-to-visualization models, covering 20+ chart types and
diverse data science queries, including trend analysis, correlation, outlier
detection, and predictive analytics. It comprises 1,985 samples, each with a
data table, natural language query, short answer, visualization code, and
annotated charts. The queries involve complex reasoning, conversational turns,
and dynamic data retrieval. We benchmark 11 open-source and closed-source
models, revealing significant performance gaps, highlighting key challenges,
and offering insights for future advancements. To close this gap, we propose
the first cross-modal actor-critic agentic framework that jointly refines the
textual answer and visualization code, increasing GPT-4o`s pass rate from 26%
to 42% over the direct approach and improving chart quality. We also introduce
an automated LLM-based evaluation framework that enables scalable assessment
across thousands of samples without human annotation, measuring answer

Motivation: To assess the reliability of large language models in evaluating writing tasks and explore hybrid scoring models.

Method: Used generalizability theory to analyze and compare scoring consistency between human and AI raters in AP Chinese writing tasks involving holistic and analytic scores.

Result: Human raters showed higher reliability, but AI raters displayed reasonable consistency, particularly for story narration tasks. Hybrid scoring improved overall reliability.

Conclusion: Hybrid scoring models combining human and AI raters can enhance the reliability of large-scale writing assessments.

Abstract: This study investigates the estimation of reliability for large language
models (LLMs) in scoring writing tasks from the AP Chinese Language and Culture
Exam. Using generalizability theory, the research evaluates and compares score
consistency between human and AI raters across two types of AP Chinese
free-response writing tasks: story narration and email response. These essays
were independently scored by two trained human raters and seven AI raters. Each
essay received four scores: one holistic score and three analytic scores
corresponding to the domains of task completion, delivery, and language use.
Results indicate that although human raters produced more reliable scores
overall, LLMs demonstrated reasonable consistency under certain conditions,
particularly for story narration tasks. Composite scoring that incorporates
both human and AI raters improved reliability, which supports that hybrid
scoring models may offer benefits for large-scale writing assessments.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the scarcity of resources and annotated data in low-resource languages like Vietnamese, crucial for advancing legal NLP.

Method: The authors developed the VLQA dataset, performed statistical analyses, and evaluated its effectiveness using state-of-the-art models on legal information retrieval and question-answering.

Result: Experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the VLQA dataset for Vietnamese legal NLP tasks, providing valuable insights for low-resource domains.

Conclusion: The VLQA dataset is a significant step toward improving legal NLP in Vietnamese and showcases the potential for addressing low-resource language challenges.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant
achievements in various domains, including legal text processing. Leveraging
LLMs for legal tasks is a natural evolution and an increasingly compelling
choice. However, their capabilities are often portrayed as greater than they
truly are. Despite the progress, we are still far from the ultimate goal of
fully automating legal tasks using artificial intelligence (AI) and natural
language processing (NLP). Moreover, legal systems are deeply domain-specific
and exhibit substantial variation across different countries and languages. The
need for building legal text processing applications for different natural
languages is, therefore, large and urgent. However, there is a big challenge
for legal NLP in low-resource languages such as Vietnamese due to the scarcity
of resources and annotated data. The need for labeled legal corpora for
supervised training, validation, and supervised fine-tuning is critical. In
this paper, we introduce the VLQA dataset, a comprehensive and high-quality
resource tailored for the Vietnamese legal domain. We also conduct a
comprehensive statistical analysis of the dataset and evaluate its
effectiveness through experiments with state-of-the-art models on legal
information retrieval and question-answering tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomalies in language data, such as spam or fake news, are challenging due to their sparsity and diversity, and traditional detection methods struggle with limited labeled data.

Method: The paper frames anomaly detection as a few-shot binary classification problem, leveraging meta-learning with prototypical networks and domain resampling through episodic training.

Result: The proposed method shows superior performance on F1 and AUC scores across diverse datasets, outperforming established baselines in unseen tasks with minimal labeled data.

Conclusion: The study highlights the efficacy of meta-learning in generalizing anomaly detection tasks across domains and provides resources to advance the field of few-shot text anomaly detection.

Abstract: We propose a meta learning framework for detecting anomalies in human
language across diverse domains with limited labeled data. Anomalies in
language ranging from spam and fake news to hate speech pose a major challenge
due to their sparsity and variability. We treat anomaly detection as a few shot
binary classification problem and leverage meta-learning to train models that
generalize across tasks. Using datasets from domains such as SMS spam, COVID-19
fake news, and hate speech, we evaluate model generalization on unseen tasks
with minimal labeled anomalies. Our method combines episodic training with
prototypical networks and domain resampling to adapt quickly to new anomaly
detection tasks. Empirical results show that our method outperforms strong
baselines in F1 and AUC scores. We also release the code and benchmarks to
facilitate further research in few-shot text anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces FAEDKV, a training-free framework for compressing KV caches in LLMs using a novel Fourier transform method. It improves memory and computational efficiency while maintaining unbiased information retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The use of large memory footprints and computational demands for KV cache in long-context tasks hinders the efficacy of LLMs. Existing compression strategies introduce bias and sometimes involve expensive retraining.

Method: The proposed FAEDKV employs a novel Infinite-Window Fourier Transform (IWDFT) to convert the KV cache into the frequency domain, ensuring equal contribution of all tokens to the compressed representation.

Result: Experiments on the LongBench benchmark reveal that FAEDKV outperforms existing methods by up to 22% and achieves better retrieval accuracy in tasks like Needle-In-A-Haystack.

Conclusion: FAEDKV offers an efficient, unbiased, and training-free method for KV cache compression, ensuring high retention of contextual information and significant improvements in task performance.

Abstract: The efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long-context tasks is often
hampered by the substantial memory footprint and computational demands of the
Key-Value (KV) cache. Current compression strategies, including token eviction
and learned projections, frequently lead to biased representations -- either by
overemphasizing recent/high-attention tokens or by repeatedly degrading
information from earlier context -- and may require costly model retraining. We
present FAEDKV (Frequency-Adaptive Infinite-Window for KV cache), a novel,
training-free KV cache compression framework that ensures unbiased information
retention. FAEDKV operates by transforming the KV cache into the frequency
domain using a proposed Infinite-Window Fourier Transform (IWDFT). This
approach allows for the equalized contribution of all tokens to the compressed
representation, effectively preserving both early and recent contextual
information. A preliminary frequency ablation study identifies critical
spectral components for layer-wise, targeted compression. Experiments on
LongBench benchmark demonstrate FAEDKV's superiority over existing methods by
up to 22\%. In addition, our method shows superior, position-agnostic retrieval
accuracy on the Needle-In-A-Haystack task compared to compression based
approaches.

*Akash Ghosh,Aparna Garimella,Pritika Ramu,Sambaran Bandyopadhyay,Sriparna Saha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new task of generating complex statistical infographics from documents, alongside a novel dataset (Infodat) and method (Infogen) for accomplishing it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI and LLM-based approaches are limited to generating simple visuals like charts and do not address the generation of complex, contextually accurate infographics requiring deeper text comprehension.

Method: The paper defines infographic metadata, introduces the benchmark dataset Infodat, and proposes a two-stage framework called Infogen, where metadata is generated by LLMs and then translated into infographic code.

Result: Infogen demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in generating statistical infographics, outperforming both closed and open-source LLM baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed task, dataset, and model provide a significant step toward automating infographic generation, simplifying data visualization in complex contexts while setting a new benchmark in this domain.

Abstract: Statistical infographics are powerful tools that simplify complex data into
visually engaging and easy-to-understand formats. Despite advancements in AI,
particularly with LLMs, existing efforts have been limited to generating simple
charts, with no prior work addressing the creation of complex infographics from
text-heavy documents that demand a deep understanding of the content. We
address this gap by introducing the task of generating statistical infographics
composed of multiple sub-charts (e.g., line, bar, pie) that are contextually
accurate, insightful, and visually aligned. To achieve this, we define
infographic metadata that includes its title and textual insights, along with
sub-chart-specific details such as their corresponding data and alignment. We
also present Infodat, the first benchmark dataset for text-to-infographic
metadata generation, where each sample links a document to its metadata. We
propose Infogen, a two-stage framework where fine-tuned LLMs first generate
metadata, which is then converted into infographic code. Extensive evaluations
on Infodat demonstrate that Infogen achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming both closed and open-source LLMs in text-to-statistical
infographic generation.

### [86] [A Tensor-Based Compiler and a Runtime for Neuron-Level DNN Certifier Specifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20055)
*Avaljot Singh,Yamin Chandini Sarita,Aditya Mishra,Ishaan Goyal,Gagandeep Singh,Charith Mendis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel compiler framework that translates neuron-level DNN certifier designs into tensor-based implementations automatically, enabling flexibility and comparable performance to manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty in designing and implementing new or modified DNN certifiers due to the mismatch between neuron-level design and tensor-level execution.

Method: A compiler framework with a stack-based IR and shape analysis for automatic translation, combined with g-BCSR tensor format for optimizing sparsity representation.

Result: The framework simplifies the creation of new certifiers, offers flexibility across diverse DNNs, and delivers performance comparable to manual optimization.

Conclusion: This approach addresses the semantic gap in DNN certifier development, making it easier and more efficient to create and implement certifiers.

Abstract: The uninterpretability of DNNs has led to the adoption of abstract
interpretation-based certification as a practical means to establish trust in
real-world systems that rely on DNNs. However, the current landscape supports
only a limited set of certifiers, and developing new ones or modifying existing
ones for different applications remains difficult. This is because the
mathematical design of certifiers is expressed at the neuron level, while their
implementations are optimized and executed at the tensor level. This mismatch
creates a semantic gap between design and implementation, making manual
bridging both complex and expertise-intensive -- requiring deep knowledge in
formal methods, high-performance computing, etc.
  We propose a compiler framework that automatically translates neuron-level
specifications of DNN certifiers into tensor-based, layer-level
implementations. This is enabled by two key innovations: a novel stack-based
intermediate representation (IR) and a shape analysis that infers the implicit
tensor operations needed to simulate the neuron-level semantics. During
lifting, the shape analysis creates tensors in the minimal shape required to
perform the corresponding operations. The IR also enables domain-specific
optimizations as rewrites. At runtime, the resulting tensor computations
exhibit sparsity tied to the DNN architecture. This sparsity does not align
well with existing formats. To address this, we introduce g-BCSR, a
double-compression format that represents tensors as collections of blocks of
varying sizes, each possibly internally sparse.
  Using our compiler and g-BCSR, we make it easy to develop new certifiers and
analyze their utility across diverse DNNs. Despite its flexibility, the
compiler achieves performance comparable to hand-optimized implementations.

*Ran Xu,Yuchen Zhuang,Yue Yu,Haoyu Wang,Wenqi Shi,Carl Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the limitations of Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems when applied to diverse and realistic knowledge retrieval scenarios, emphasizing the need for more adaptive retrieval strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for evaluating RAG systems are primarily based on general-domain datasets like Wikipedia, leaving their practical effectiveness in diverse real-world scenarios less understood.

Method: The research evaluates RAG systems using MassiveDS, a large-scale and heterogeneous datastore, to identify performance variations and challenges across different retrieval sources and knowledge-routing capabilities.

Result: The study finds that RAG systems have limitations such as retrieval benefiting smaller models more, rerankers not adding significant value, no dominant retrieval source across scenarios, and LLMs struggling with routing queries across diverse knowledge sources.

Conclusion: Adaptive retrieval strategies are critical for improving the deployment of RAG systems in real-world applications, where knowledge sources are often heterogeneous and diverse.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge retrieved at inference time. While RAG
demonstrates strong performance on benchmarks largely derived from
general-domain corpora like Wikipedia, its effectiveness under realistic,
diverse retrieval scenarios remains underexplored. We evaluated RAG systems
using MassiveDS, a large-scale datastore with mixture of knowledge, and
identified critical limitations: retrieval mainly benefits smaller models,
rerankers add minimal value, and no single retrieval source consistently
excels. Moreover, current LLMs struggle to route queries across heterogeneous
knowledge sources. These findings highlight the need for adaptive retrieval
strategies before deploying RAG in real-world settings. Our code and data can

### [88] [ProsodyLM: Uncovering the Emerging Prosody Processing Capabilities in Speech Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20091)
*Kaizhi Qian,Xulin Fan,Junrui Ni,Slava Shechtman,Mark Hasegawa-Johnson,Chuang Gan,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProsodyLM, a speech language model designed to improve prosody processing by utilizing a more efficient tokenization scheme, retaining more prosody information. Experiments show its capabilities emerge during pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current methods of training speech language models often fail in processing prosody effectively because speech is converted into discrete tokens, which lose significant prosody details.

Method: The authors propose a new tokenization scheme that includes both transcription into text and word-level prosody tokens, aimed at retaining prosody information for better understanding by text-based LLMs.

Result: ProsodyLM demonstrates emergent capabilities in handling prosody during pre-training, such as producing nuanced prosody in generated speech, understanding emotions and stress, and maintaining prosody consistency over long contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed ProsodyLM is effective in learning and leveraging prosody information, enhancing prosody-related tasks without additional fine-tuning.

Abstract: Speech language models refer to language models with speech processing and
understanding capabilities. One key desirable capability for speech language
models is the ability to capture the intricate interdependency between content
and prosody. The existing mainstream paradigm of training speech language
models, which converts speech into discrete tokens before feeding them into
LLMs, is sub-optimal in learning prosody information -- we find that the
resulting LLMs do not exhibit obvious emerging prosody processing capabilities
via pre-training alone. To overcome this, we propose ProsodyLM, which
introduces a simple tokenization scheme amenable to learning prosody. Each
speech utterance is first transcribed into text, followed by a sequence of
word-level prosody tokens. Compared with conventional speech tokenization
schemes, the proposed tokenization scheme retains more complete prosody
information, and is more understandable to text-based LLMs. We find that
ProsodyLM can learn surprisingly diverse emerging prosody processing
capabilities through pre-training alone, ranging from harnessing the prosody
nuances in generated speech, such as contrastive focus, understanding emotion
and stress in an utterance, to maintaining prosody consistency in long
contexts.

*Rodrigo Gabriel Salazar Alva,Matías Nuñez,Cristian López,Javier Martín Arista*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality Old English texts, aimed at boosting NLP capabilities for under-resourced ancient languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Old English is critically under-resourced, limiting accessible NLP techniques for studying cultural and linguistic heritage. The authors aim to bridge this gap.

Method: The framework utilizes LoRA for fine-tuning, backtranslation for data augmentation, and a dual-agent pipeline for content generation and translation tasks. Automated metrics and human evaluations are used for assessment.

Result: Automated metrics like BLEU scores improve significantly (from 26 to 65+), and expert human assessments validate generated texts' grammatical and stylistic accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach expands the Old English corpus while offering a scalable and culturally impactful method for preserving endangered languages using AI.

Abstract: Preserving ancient languages is essential for understanding humanity's
cultural and linguistic heritage, yet Old English remains critically
under-resourced, limiting its accessibility to modern natural language
processing (NLP) techniques. We present a scalable framework that uses advanced
large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality Old English texts,
addressing this gap. Our approach combines parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(Low-Rank Adaptation, LoRA), data augmentation via backtranslation, and a
dual-agent pipeline that separates the tasks of content generation (in English)
and translation (into Old English). Evaluation with automated metrics (BLEU,
METEOR, and CHRF) shows significant improvements over baseline models, with
BLEU scores increasing from 26 to over 65 for English-to-Old English
translation. Expert human assessment also confirms high grammatical accuracy
and stylistic fidelity in the generated texts. Beyond expanding the Old English
corpus, our method offers a practical blueprint for revitalizing other
endangered languages, effectively uniting AI innovation with the goals of
cultural preservation.

*Anas Mohamed,Azal Ahmad Khan,Xinran Wang,Ahmad Faraz Khan,Shuwen Ge,Saman Bahzad Khan,Ayaan Ahmad,Ali Anwar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sem-DPO, a variant of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which improves prompt engineering in generative AI by ensuring semantic consistency while maintaining simplicity and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative AI struggles with prompt-sensitive output quality and semantic inconsistencies in prompts enhanced by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Method: Sem-DPO adjusts the DPO loss with a weight proportional to cosine distance in embedding space, maintaining semantic consistency by down-weighting mismatched prompts. It includes a proven analytical bound on semantic drift.

Result: Sem-DPO showed 8-12% better CLIP similarity and 5-9% higher human-preference scores across benchmarks, outperforming existing baselines in prompt optimization.

Conclusion: Sem-DPO sets a new benchmark by combining simplicity, efficiency, and semantic awareness in prompt engineering, potentially expanding preference optimization in language models.

Abstract: Generative AI can now synthesize strikingly realistic images from text, yet
output quality remains highly sensitive to how prompts are phrased. Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) offers a lightweight, off-policy alternative to
RL for automatic prompt engineering, but its token-level regularization leaves
semantic inconsistency unchecked as prompts that win higher preference scores
can still drift away from the user's intended meaning.
  We introduce Sem-DPO, a variant of DPO that preserves semantic consistency
yet retains its simplicity and efficiency. Sem-DPO scales the DPO loss by an
exponential weight proportional to the cosine distance between the original
prompt and winning candidate in embedding space, softly down-weighting training
signals that would otherwise reward semantically mismatched prompts. We provide
the first analytical bound on semantic drift for preference-tuned prompt
generators, showing that Sem-DPO keeps learned prompts within a provably
bounded neighborhood of the original text. On three standard text-to-image
prompt-optimization benchmarks and two language models, Sem-DPO achieves 8-12%
higher CLIP similarity and 5-9% higher human-preference scores (HPSv2.1,
PickScore) than DPO, while also outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These
findings suggest that strong flat baselines augmented with semantic weighting
should become the new standard for prompt-optimization studies and lay the
groundwork for broader, semantics-aware preference optimization in language
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper details team CRUISE's solution for the KDD Cup 2025 CRAG-MM challenge. Their focus was on minimizing hallucinations in Vision Language Models (VLMs) using a multi-stage framework, achieving 3rd place in Task 1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The modern Vision Language Models (VLMs) struggle with hallucinations, especially in scenarios involving egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex questions. This limitation hampers their usability in fact-seeking, real-world applications.

Method: The proposed solution involves a multi-stage framework with a lightweight query router, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, dual-pathways generation, and post-hoc verification to ensure factual accuracy and reliability.

Result: Their approach secured 3rd place in Task 1 of the KDD Cup 2025 CRAG-MM competition, validating the efficiency of their strategy in multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

Conclusion: By prioritizing accuracy and reliability over completeness, the team demonstrated an effective way to reduce hallucinations in VLMs. Their work underscores the importance of conservative strategies in addressing real-world challenges in multi-modal scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents the technical solution developed by team CRUISE for the
KDD Cup 2025 Meta Comprehensive RAG Benchmark for Multi-modal, Multi-turn
(CRAG-MM) challenge. The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of
modern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate,
especially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex,
multi-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world
applications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual
accuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust,
multi-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over
completeness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for
efficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways
generation and a post-hoc verification. This conservative strategy is designed
to minimize hallucinations, which incur a severe penalty in the competition's
scoring metric. Our approach achieved 3rd place in Task 1, demonstrating the
effectiveness of prioritizing answer reliability in complex multi-modal RAG
systems. Our implementation is available at

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of document understanding (DU) in long-context scenarios, proposing an automated multi-agent framework to efficiently generate challenging long-context questions in English and Arabic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for long-context DU depend heavily on human annotation, making them costly and inefficient, especially for low-resource languages like Arabic.

Method: The paper introduces a fully automated multi-agent framework to create high-quality single and multi-page questions for long-context documents across diverse domains.

Result: Generated questions (AraEngLongBench) prove to be particularly challenging for major LVLMs, showcasing the effectiveness of the framework in benchmarking and improving long-context DU.

Conclusion: The research enhances LVLMs' understanding of complex, long-context documents and makes a significant contribution to DU tasks by providing automated tools and datasets.

Abstract: Document Understanding (DU) in long-contextual scenarios with complex layouts
remains a significant challenge in vision-language research. Although Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel at short-context DU tasks, their
performance declines in long-context settings. A key limitation is the scarcity
of fine-grained training data, particularly for low-resource languages such as
Arabic. Existing state-of-the-art techniques rely heavily on human annotation,
which is costly and inefficient. We propose a fully automated, multi-agent
interactive framework to generate long-context questions efficiently. Our
approach efficiently generates high-quality single- and multi-page questions
for extensive English and Arabic documents, covering hundreds of pages across
diverse domains. This facilitates the development of LVLMs with enhanced
long-context understanding ability. Experimental results in this work have
shown that our generated English and Arabic questions
(\textbf{AraEngLongBench}) are quite challenging to major open- and
close-source LVLMs. The code and data proposed in this work can be found in

TL;DR: The paper introduces UGST, a new framework for tracking user goals in conversations, and proposes a methodology to improve goal-oriented user simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with maintaining consistent goal-oriented behavior in multi-turn conversations, limiting their reliability.

Method: UGST tracks user goal progression in conversations, combined with a three-stage methodology for autonomous goal tracking and response generation. New evaluation metrics for measuring goal alignment in simulators are also proposed.

Result: The framework shows significant improvements in goal alignment across two benchmarks: MultiWOZ 2.4 and τ-Bench.

Conclusion: UGST fills a critical gap in conversational AI by enabling better development of goal-oriented user simulators, setting a foundation for enhanced conversational system design.

Abstract: User simulators are essential to conversational AI, enabling scalable agent
development and evaluation through simulated interactions. While current Large
Language Models (LLMs) have advanced user simulation capabilities, we reveal
that they struggle to consistently demonstrate goal-oriented behavior across
multi-turn conversations--a critical limitation that compromises their
reliability in downstream applications. We introduce User Goal State Tracking
(UGST), a novel framework that tracks user goal progression throughout
conversations. Leveraging UGST, we present a three-stage methodology for
developing user simulators that can autonomously track goal progression and
reason to generate goal-aligned responses. Moreover, we establish comprehensive
evaluation metrics for measuring goal alignment in user simulators, and
demonstrate that our approach yields substantial improvements across two
benchmarks (MultiWOZ 2.4 and {\tau}-Bench). Our contributions address a
critical gap in conversational AI and establish UGST as an essential framework
for developing goal-aligned user simulators.

### [94] [SGPO: Self-Generated Preference Optimization based on Self-Improver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20181)
*Hyeonji Lee,Daejin Jo,Seohwan Yun,Sungwoong Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) often need alignment to human preferences for reliable use. The paper proposes a new framework called SGPO, which uses self-generated data for on-policy preference optimization and avoids external datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLMs to human preferences is essential for their deployment, but existing methods have limitations like dependence on human-annotated data and issues with training distribution shifts.

Method: The authors introduce SGPO, which combines a policy model and improver into a single entity that self-generates preference data via incremental improvements, referencing outputs from supervised fine-tuning.

Result: SGPO significantly outperforms existing approaches such as DPO and other baseline self-improving methods in tests on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard datasets without requiring external preference datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed SGPO framework demonstrates an effective alternative to human-annotated datasets by self-generating preference data, supporting better alignment of LLMs to human preferences.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their extensive pretraining on diverse
datasets, require effective alignment to human preferences for practical and
reliable deployment. Conventional alignment methods typically employ off-policy
learning and depend on human-annotated datasets, which limits their broad
applicability and introduces distribution shift issues during training. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Generated Preference Optimization
based on Self-Improver (SGPO), an innovative alignment framework that leverages
an on-policy self-improving mechanism. Specifically, the improver refines
responses from a policy model to self-generate preference data for direct
preference optimization (DPO) of the policy model. Here, the improver and
policy are unified into a single model, and in order to generate higher-quality
preference data, this self-improver learns to make incremental yet discernible
improvements to the current responses by referencing supervised fine-tuning
outputs. Experimental results on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard show that the
proposed SGPO significantly improves performance over DPO and baseline
self-improving methods without using external preference data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a dataset and evaluation benchmark, "SessionIntentBench," to improve modeling and understanding of user intention in E-commerce browsing sessions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works fail to effectively model user intention in E-commerce purchasing sessions due to insufficient data exploitation and reliance on superficial information like product titles and descriptions.

Method: The authors introduce an "intention tree" concept and create a multimodal benchmark dataset, SessionIntentBench, comprising over 1.9 million intention entries and 13 million tasks sourced from user sessions, with ground-truth annotations for evaluation.

Result: The experimental results show that current Large (Vision) Language Models (L(V)LMs) perform poorly at capturing intention across sessions. Injecting explicit intention information, however, enhances their performance.

Conclusion: SessionIntentBench provides a scalable and benchmarked way to improve understanding of customer intention, and using explicit intention modeling can significantly enhance the performance of existing L(V)LMs in this domain.

Abstract: Session history is a common way of recording user interacting behaviors
throughout a browsing activity with multiple products. For example, if an user
clicks a product webpage and then leaves, it might because there are certain
features that don't satisfy the user, which serve as an important indicator of
on-the-spot user preferences. However, all prior works fail to capture and
model customer intention effectively because insufficient information
exploitation and only apparent information like descriptions and titles are
used. There is also a lack of data and corresponding benchmark for explicitly
modeling intention in E-commerce product purchase sessions. To address these
issues, we introduce the concept of an intention tree and propose a dataset
curation pipeline. Together, we construct a sibling multimodal benchmark,
SessionIntentBench, that evaluates L(V)LMs' capability on understanding
inter-session intention shift with four subtasks. With 1,952,177 intention
entries, 1,132,145 session intention trajectories, and 13,003,664 available
tasks mined using 10,905 sessions, we provide a scalable way to exploit the
existing session data for customer intention understanding. We conduct human
annotations to collect ground-truth label for a subset of collected data to
form an evaluation gold set. Extensive experiments on the annotated data
further confirm that current L(V)LMs fail to capture and utilize the intention
across the complex session setting. Further analysis show injecting intention
enhances LLMs' performances.

*Yumeng Wang,Zhiyuan Fan,Jiayu Liu,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MultiRole-R1, a framework to enhance subjective reasoning in large models by promoting diverse role perspectives and improving reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models excel at objective tasks but struggle with subjective ones due to homogeneous reasoning caused by the reliance on single-ground-truth supervision and reward systems.

Method: They use an unsupervised pipeline for generating diverse reasoning chains and employ a reinforcement learning approach (Group Relative Policy Optimization) with diversity-focused reward shaping.

Result: The proposed method improves reasoning diversity and accuracy, showing effectiveness on six benchmarks.

Conclusion: MultiRole-R1 enhances subjective reasoning by combining diversity in role perspectives and verifiable rewards, demonstrating the potential for broader reasoning capabilities in large models.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRM) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capabilities
have shown strong performance on objective tasks, such as math reasoning and
coding. However, their effectiveness on subjective questions that may have
different responses from different perspectives is still limited by a tendency
towards homogeneous reasoning, introduced by the reliance on a single ground
truth in supervised fine-tuning and verifiable reward in reinforcement
learning. Motivated by the finding that increasing role perspectives
consistently improves performance, we propose MultiRole-R1, a
diversity-enhanced framework with multiple role perspectives, to improve the
accuracy and diversity in subjective reasoning tasks. MultiRole-R1 features an
unsupervised data construction pipeline that generates reasoning chains that
incorporate diverse role perspectives. We further employ reinforcement learning
via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with reward shaping, by taking
diversity as a reward signal in addition to the verifiable reward. With
specially designed reward functions, we successfully promote perspective
diversity and lexical diversity, uncovering a positive relation between
reasoning diversity and accuracy. Our experiment on six benchmarks demonstrates
MultiRole-R1's effectiveness and generalizability in enhancing both subjective
and objective reasoning, showcasing the potential of diversity-enhanced
training in LRMs.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a factor analysis-based evaluation method to uncover latent skills in 60 LLMs evaluated across 44 tasks, aiming to improve benchmarking practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to evaluating LLMs lack a nuanced understanding of task relationships, redundancies, and comprehensive skill profiling.

Method: The authors introduce a factor analysis paradigm to identify latent skills across benchmarks, using a leaderboard with extensive LLM performance data.

Result: Factor analysis reveals a small number of latent skills that explain the majority of performance variations across benchmarks.

Conclusion: The findings provide tools for identifying redundant tasks, optimizing model selection, and profiling LLMs based on latent skills, enhancing future evaluations.

Abstract: Current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) rely on benchmark scores,
but it is difficult to interpret what these individual scores reveal about a
model's overall skills. Specifically, as a community we lack understanding of
how tasks relate to one another, what they measure in common, how they differ,
or which ones are redundant. As a result, models are often assessed via a
single score averaged across benchmarks, an approach that fails to capture the
models' wholistic strengths and limitations. Here, we propose a new evaluation
paradigm that uses factor analysis to identify latent skills driving
performance across benchmarks. We apply this method to a comprehensive new
leaderboard showcasing the performance of 60 LLMs on 44 tasks, and identify a
small set of latent skills that largely explain performance. Finally, we turn
these insights into practical tools that identify redundant tasks, aid in model
selection, and profile models along each latent skill.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling multi-view news representations and dynamic user interests spanning short- and long-term preferences for personalized news recommendation.

Method: Introduced Co-NAML-LSTUR, which combines NAML for multi-view news modeling with LSTUR for dual-scale user representation, enhanced by BERT-based word embeddings for superior semantic feature extraction.

Result: Experimental evaluation on MIND-small and MIND-large benchmarks shows significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Combining multi-view news modeling with dual-scale user representation is effective for improving personalized news recommendation systems.

Abstract: News recommendation systems play a vital role in mitigating information
overload by delivering personalized news content. A central challenge is to
effectively model both multi-view news representations and the dynamic nature
of user interests, which often span both short- and long-term preferences.
Existing methods typically rely on single-view features of news articles (e.g.,
titles or categories) or fail to comprehensively capture user preferences
across time scales. In this work, we propose Co-NAML-LSTUR, a hybrid news
recommendation framework that integrates NAML for attentive multi-view news
modeling and LSTUR for capturing both long- and short-term user
representations. Our model also incorporates BERT-based word embeddings to
enhance semantic feature extraction. We evaluate Co-NAML-LSTUR on two widely
used benchmarks, MIND-small and MIND-large. Experimental results show that
Co-NAML-LSTUR achieves substantial improvements over most state-of-the-art
baselines on MIND-small and MIND-large, respectively. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of combining multi-view news representations with dual-scale
user modeling. The implementation of our model is publicly available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of current mental health support tools, particularly in augmenting realism, simulating specialized psychotherapy, and capturing therapeutic progression over time.

Method: The authors developed INT, a system to simulate expert narrative therapists, and IMA, a metric to assess the therapy's effectiveness by identifying critical narrative shifts in client speech.

Result: Experimental evaluations on both simulated and human participants show that the proposed INT model outperforms standard LLMs in therapeutic quality and depth.

Conclusion: The proposed methods demonstrate improved simulation of narrative therapy and its evaluation, enabling broader access and higher quality mental health support with potential social applications.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities
for mental health support, yet current approaches lack realism in simulating
specialized psychotherapy and fail to capture therapeutic progression over
time. Narrative therapy, which helps individuals transform problematic life
stories into empowering alternatives, remains underutilized due to limited
access and social stigma. We address these limitations through a comprehensive
framework with two core components. First, INT (Interactive Narrative
Therapist) simulates expert narrative therapists by planning therapeutic
stages, guiding reflection levels, and generating contextually appropriate
expert-like responses. Second, IMA (Innovative Moment Assessment) provides a
therapy-centric evaluation method that quantifies effectiveness by tracking
"Innovative Moments" (IMs), critical narrative shifts in client speech
signaling therapy progress. Experimental results on 260 simulated clients and
230 human participants reveal that INT consistently outperforms standard LLMs
in therapeutic quality and depth. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
INT in synthesizing high-quality support conversations to facilitate social
applications.

### [100] [Modeling Professionalism in Expert Questioning through Linguistic Differentiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20249)
*Giulia D'Agostino,Chung-Chi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines professionalism in expert communication, especially in finance, using linguistic features to measure and model it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored area of professionalism in expert communication in high-stakes fields.

Method: Developed a novel annotation framework, used human and LLM-generated datasets, and applied classification models for analysis.

Result: Identified strong correlations between linguistic features, human judgments, and authorship origin; classifier outperformed baselines in question source prediction.

Conclusion: Professionalism is a measurable construct that can be modeled through interpretable linguistic features and has domain-general applications.

Abstract: Professionalism is a crucial yet underexplored dimension of expert
communication, particularly in high-stakes domains like finance. This paper
investigates how linguistic features can be leveraged to model and evaluate
professionalism in expert questioning. We introduce a novel annotation
framework to quantify structural and pragmatic elements in financial analyst
questions, such as discourse regulators, prefaces, and request types. Using
both human-authored and large language model (LLM)-generated questions, we
construct two datasets: one annotated for perceived professionalism and one
labeled by question origin. We show that the same linguistic features correlate
strongly with both human judgments and authorship origin, suggesting a shared
stylistic foundation. Furthermore, a classifier trained solely on these
interpretable features outperforms gemini-2.0 and SVM baselines in
distinguishing expert-authored questions. Our findings demonstrate that
professionalism is a learnable, domain-general construct that can be captured
through linguistically grounded modeling.

### [101] [Post-Completion Learning for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20252)
*Xiang Fei,Siqi Wang,Shu Wei,Yuxiang Nie,Wei Shi,Hao Feng,Can Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Post-Completion Learning (PCL), a training framework for language models to utilize the sequence space post-output completion, improving reasoning and self-evaluation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional language model training stops at end-of-sequence tokens, missing opportunities to leverage the post-completion space for enhancing model abilities.

Method: The authors propose PCL, which uses reinforcement learning to train models to assess and update outputs post-completion. They implement dual-track supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and mixed reinforcement learning optimization.

Result: Experiments show PCL outperforms traditional SFT and RL on multiple datasets and models.

Conclusion: PCL demonstrates a novel approach to improve language model outputs without affecting inference efficiency, offering a promising direction for future training paradigms.

Abstract: Current language model training paradigms typically terminate learning upon
reaching the end-of-sequence (<eos>}) token, overlooking the potential learning
opportunities in the post-completion space. We propose Post-Completion Learning
(PCL), a novel training framework that systematically utilizes the sequence
space after model output completion, to enhance both the reasoning and
self-evaluation abilities. PCL enables models to continue generating
self-assessments and reward predictions during training, while maintaining
efficient inference by stopping at the completion point.
  To fully utilize this post-completion space, we design a white-box
reinforcement learning method: let the model evaluate the output content
according to the reward rules, then calculate and align the score with the
reward functions for supervision. We implement dual-track SFT to optimize both
reasoning and evaluation capabilities, and mixed it with RL training to achieve
multi-objective hybrid optimization.
  Experimental results on different datasets and models demonstrate consistent
improvements over traditional SFT and RL methods. Our method provides a new
technical path for language model training that enhances output quality while
preserving deployment efficiency.

### [102] [EMBRACE: Shaping Inclusive Opinion Representation by Aligning Implicit Conversations with Social Norms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20264)
*Abeer Aldayel,Areej Alokaili*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to evaluate how opinions, especially implicit ones, are represented in NLP models and offers methods to make these models more inclusive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods of inclusion in conversational models primarily rely on explicit mention of demographic or social group attributes, ignoring implicit opinions and risks of reinforcing stereotypes.

Method: The study models stance as a proxy for opinion, using a framework that evaluates normative alignment in conversations. Techniques include positive-unlabeled (PU) online learning and instruction-tuned language models.

Result: Evaluation reveals how implicit opinions are often misrepresented in existing models, with insights on post-training alignment via proposed methods.

Conclusion: The study provides critical tools and perspectives for enhancing inclusion in conversational NLP models, focusing on implicit opinion representation and stance alignment.

Abstract: Shaping inclusive representations that embrace diversity and ensure fair
participation and reflections of values is at the core of many
conversation-based models. However, many existing methods rely on surface
inclusion using mention of user demographics or behavioral attributes of social
groups. Such methods overlook the nuanced, implicit expression of opinion
embedded in conversations. Furthermore, the over-reliance on overt cues can
exacerbate misalignment and reinforce harmful or stereotypical representations
in model outputs. Thus, we took a step back and recognized that equitable
inclusion needs to account for the implicit expression of opinion and use the
stance of responses to validate the normative alignment. This study aims to
evaluate how opinions are represented in NLP or computational models by
introducing an alignment evaluation framework that foregrounds implicit, often
overlooked conversations and evaluates the normative social views and
discourse. Our approach models the stance of responses as a proxy for the
underlying opinion, enabling a considerate and reflective representation of
diverse social viewpoints. We evaluate the framework using both (i)
positive-unlabeled (PU) online learning with base classifiers, and (ii)
instruction-tuned language models to assess post-training alignment. Through
this, we provide a lens on how implicit opinions are (mis)represented and offer
a pathway toward more inclusive model behavior.

### [103] [MoL-RL: Distilling Multi-Step Environmental Feedback into LLMs for Feedback-Independent Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20278)
*Kang Yang,Jingxue Chen,Qingkun Tang,Tianxiang Zhang,Qianchun Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoL-RL, a training method that improves large language models' reasoning using multi-step environmental feedback signals, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to effectively incorporate sequential environmental feedback, either losing information by using scalar rewards or failing to leverage multi-step feedback in reasoning tasks.

Method: The proposed MoL-RL combines the MoL continual training for domain-specific signals and GRPO-based post-training to integrate feedback into reasoning, using a dual-objective optimization framework.

Result: MoL-RL achieves state-of-the-art performance in reasoning tasks like mathematical problems (MATH-500, AIME24/25) and code generation (CodeAgent-Test), with strong generalizability across model scales.

Conclusion: MoL-RL enhances LLMs' reasoning by efficiently leveraging multi-step textual feedback, offering a robust and generalizable framework for diverse reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in effectively
leveraging sequential environmental feedback (EF) signals, such as natural
language evaluations, for feedback-independent chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning. Existing approaches either convert EF into scalar rewards, losing
rich contextual information, or employ refinement datasets, failing to exploit
the multi-step and discrete nature of EF interactions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoL-RL, a novel training paradigm that integrates
multi-step EF signals into LLMs through a dual-objective optimization
framework. Our method combines MoL (Mixture-of-Losses) continual training,
which decouples domain-specific EF signals (optimized via cross-entropy loss)
and general language capabilities (preserved via Kullback-Leibler divergence),
with GRPO-based post-training to distill sequential EF interactions into
single-step inferences. This synergy enables robust feedback-independent
reasoning without relying on external feedback loops. Experimental results on
mathematical reasoning (MATH-500, AIME24/AIME25) and code generation
(CodeAgent-Test) benchmarks demonstrate that MoL-RL achieves state-of-the-art
performance with the Qwen3-8B model, while maintaining strong generalization
across model scales (Qwen3-4B). This work provides a promising approach for
leveraging multi-step textual feedback to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities
in diverse domains.

### [104] [What Language(s) Does Aya-23 Think In? How Multilinguality Affects Internal Language Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20279)
*Katharina Trinley,Toshiki Nakai,Tatiana Anikina,Tanja Baeumel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates the internal linguistic processing of Aya-23-8B, a multilingual language model, in contrast to monolingual-focused models. It explores code-mixed, cloze, and translation tasks, revealing neuron activation findings and factors impacting cross-lingual efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how multilingual training impacts LLMs' internal language processing and performance on multilingual tasks, with a specific focus on cross-lingual efficiency.

Method: The research employed logit lens and neuron specialization analysis for examining neuron activation patterns during tasks like translation and code-mixing across different language models.

Result: Findings include Aya-23's reliance on typologically related languages during translation, distinct neuron activation patterns influenced by code-mixing rates, and the concentration of language-specific neurons in its final layers.

Conclusion: The study highlights that multilingual training shapes internal representations in LLMs and offers insights for advancing cross-lingual transfer research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at multilingual tasks, yet their internal
language processing remains poorly understood. We analyze how Aya-23-8B, a
decoder-only LLM trained on balanced multilingual data, handles code-mixed,
cloze, and translation tasks compared to predominantly monolingual models like
Llama 3 and Chinese-LLaMA-2. Using logit lens and neuron specialization
analyses, we find: (1) Aya-23 activates typologically related language
representations during translation, unlike English-centric models that rely on
a single pivot language; (2) code-mixed neuron activation patterns vary with
mixing rates and are shaped more by the base language than the mixed-in one;
and (3) Aya-23's languagespecific neurons for code-mixed inputs concentrate in
final layers, diverging from prior findings on decoder-only models. Neuron
overlap analysis further shows that script similarity and typological relations
impact processing across model types. These findings reveal how multilingual
training shapes LLM internals and inform future cross-lingual transfer
research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AQUA, a large language model (LLM) tailored for the aquaculture industry to address challenges like disease outbreaks, feeding inefficiencies, and water quality issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in aquaculture such as disease outbreaks, hatchery inefficiencies, and poor water quality, as current machine learning methods fail to address these domain-specific issues effectively.

Method: Proposes AQUA, an LLM engineered for aquaculture, and introduces AQUADAPT, a framework combining expert knowledge, language models, and automated evaluation for synthesizing high-quality data.

Result: Developed AQUA and its framework, AQUADAPT, as tools to advance data-driven innovation and decision-making in aquaculture.

Conclusion: AQUA represents the first LLM adapted for aquaculture, aiming to enhance research, advisory systems, and operational decision-making within the industry.

Abstract: Aquaculture plays a vital role in global food security and coastal economies
by providing sustainable protein sources. As the industry expands to meet
rising demand, it faces growing challenges such as disease outbreaks,
inefficient feeding practices, rising labor costs, logistical inefficiencies,
and critical hatchery issues, including high mortality rates and poor water
quality control. Although artificial intelligence has made significant
progress, existing machine learning methods fall short of addressing the
domain-specific complexities of aquaculture. To bridge this gap, we introduce
AQUA, the first large language model (LLM) tailored for aquaculture, designed
to support farmers, researchers, and industry practitioners. Central to this
effort is AQUADAPT (Data Acquisition, Processing and Tuning), an Agentic
Framework for generating and refining high-quality synthetic data using a
combination of expert knowledge, largescale language models, and automated
evaluation techniques. Our work lays the foundation for LLM-driven innovations
in aquaculture research, advisory systems, and decision-making tools.

*Abdullah Alabdullah,Lifeng Han,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges posed by Arabic dialects in NLP, focusing on DA-MSA translation for Levantine, Egyptian, and Gulf dialects through training-free prompting techniques and resource-efficient fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the significant linguistic divide between Dialectal Arabic (DA) and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) that limits access to digital services, education, and progress in Arabic machine translation.

Method: Evaluation of prompting techniques using large language models and development of fine-tuning with quantized models for resource efficiency.

Result: Few-shot prompting outperformed other methods, with GPT-4o achieving the highest prompting performance. Joint dialect-trained fine-tuning models surpassed single-dialect ones, with quantization reducing memory usage significantly.

Conclusion: High-quality DA-MSA translation can be achieved even in resource-constrained settings, offering practical insights for enhancing Arabic NLP, and promoting inclusivity in language technologies.

Abstract: Dialectal Arabic (DA) poses a persistent challenge for natural language
processing (NLP), as most everyday communication in the Arab world occurs in
dialects that diverge significantly from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). This
linguistic divide limits access to digital services and educational resources
and impedes progress in Arabic machine translation. This paper presents two
core contributions to advancing DA-MSA translation for the Levantine, Egyptian,
and Gulf dialects, particularly in low-resource and computationally constrained
settings: a comprehensive evaluation of training-free prompting techniques, and
the development of a resource-efficient fine-tuning pipeline. Our evaluation of
prompting strategies across six large language models (LLMs) found that
few-shot prompting consistently outperformed zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and
our proposed Ara-TEaR method. GPT-4o achieved the highest performance across
all prompting settings. For fine-tuning, a quantized Gemma2-9B model achieved a
CHrF++ score of 49.88, outperforming zero-shot GPT-4o (44.58). Joint
multi-dialect trained models outperformed single-dialect counterparts by over
10% CHrF++, and 4-bit quantization reduced memory usage by 60% with less than
1% performance loss. The results and insights of our experiments offer a
practical blueprint for improving dialectal inclusion in Arabic NLP, showing
that high-quality DA-MSA machine translation is achievable even with limited
resources and paving the way for more inclusive language technologies.

*Bernd J. Kröger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces DYNARTmo, a new articulatory model for speech visualization, emphasizing coarticulation and control parameters. It has educational and therapeutic applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance visualization and understanding of speech articulation processes for educational and therapeutic purposes, leveraging dynamic modeling.

Method: The paper uses the UK-DYNAMO framework, incorporates underspecification and gesture control principles, and simulates articulators with continuous and discrete parameters.

Result: DYNARTmo provides a web-based application with midsagittal, glottal, and palatal views, capable of simulating vocalic and consonantal articulation configurations.

Conclusion: The static modeling approach is successful, and future efforts will focus on dynamic articulation and integration with acoustics to extend its capabilities.

Abstract: We present DYNARTmo, a dynamic articulatory model designed to visualize
speech articulation processes in a two-dimensional midsagittal plane. The model
builds upon the UK-DYNAMO framework and integrates principles of articulatory
underspecification, segmental and gestural control, and coarticulation.
DYNARTmo simulates six key articulators based on ten continuous and six
discrete control parameters, allowing for the generation of both vocalic and
consonantal articulatory configurations. The current implementation is embedded
in a web-based application (SpeechArticulationTrainer) that includes sagittal,
glottal, and palatal views, making it suitable for use in phonetics education
and speech therapy. While this paper focuses on the static modeling aspects,
future work will address dynamic movement generation and integration with
articulatory-acoustic modules.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces RMTBench, a user-centric bilingual benchmark to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in role-playing scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in existing benchmarks for LLM role-playing, which are character-focused, oversimplified, and misaligned with real-world applications.

Method: The authors propose RMTBench, featuring 80 characters with detailed or abstract traits, 8,000 dialogue rounds, multi-turn dialogue simulations, and an evaluation focused on user motivation fulfillment.

Result: The benchmark provides a comprehensive framework to evaluate LLMs in practical settings, emphasizing user-intention alignment over character backgrounds.

Conclusion: RMTBench offers a practical and effective solution to bridge the gap between academic benchmarks and real-world role-playing applications for LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown outstanding
potential for role-playing applications. Evaluating these capabilities is
becoming crucial yet remains challenging. Existing benchmarks mostly adopt a
\textbf{character-centric} approach, simplify user-character interactions to
isolated Q&A tasks, and fail to reflect real-world applications. To address
this limitation, we introduce RMTBench, a comprehensive \textbf{user-centric}
bilingual role-playing benchmark featuring 80 diverse characters and over 8,000
dialogue rounds. RMTBench includes custom characters with detailed backgrounds
and abstract characters defined by simple traits, enabling evaluation across
various user scenarios. Our benchmark constructs dialogues based on explicit
user motivations rather than character descriptions, ensuring alignment with
practical user applications. Furthermore, we construct an authentic multi-turn
dialogue simulation mechanism. With carefully selected evaluation dimensions
and LLM-based scoring, this mechanism captures the complex intention of
conversations between the user and the character. By shifting focus from
character background to user intention fulfillment, RMTBench bridges the gap
between academic evaluation and practical deployment requirements, offering a
more effective framework for assessing role-playing capabilities in LLMs. All
code and datasets will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) internally encode and control output sequence length, revealing that multi-head attention mechanisms and specific hidden units play a key role in length management, which is disentangled from semantic information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the unexplored mechanisms behind how LLMs can control output sequence length, particularly under instruction-based settings.

Method: Conducted empirical studies analyzing LLMs' internal representations, focusing on multi-head attention mechanisms and scaling specific hidden units to modify output length.

Result: Revealed that multi-head attention mechanisms govern output sequence length, and specific hidden units can be scaled to adjust length while preserving generated text informativeness. Showed that length information is partially disentangled from semantic information.

Conclusion: LLMs inherently contain robust and adaptable mechanisms for length control, with certain hidden units reflecting internal awareness of length-specific attributes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, that are learned from massive amounts of text-based data.
Although LLMs can control output sequence length, particularly in
instruction-based settings, the internal mechanisms behind this control have
been unexplored yet. In this study, we provide empirical evidence on how output
sequence length information is encoded within the internal representations in
LLMs. In particular, our findings show that multi-head attention mechanisms are
critical in determining output sequence length, which can be adjusted in a
disentangled manner. By scaling specific hidden units within the model, we can
control the output sequence length without losing the informativeness of the
generated text, thereby indicating that length information is partially
disentangled from semantic information. Moreover, some hidden units become
increasingly active as prompts become more length-specific, thus reflecting the
model's internal awareness of this attribute. Our findings suggest that LLMs
have learned robust and adaptable internal mechanisms for controlling output
length without any external control.

*Eunkyu Park,Wesley Hanwen Deng,Gunhee Kim,Motahhare Eslami,Maarten Sap*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Cognitive Chain-of-Thought (CoCoT), a prompting strategy that improves visual-language model (VLM) reasoning by aligning it with human cognitive stages: perception, situation, and norm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of flat Chain-of-Thought reasoning in complex visual tasks requiring norm-grounded judgments.

Method: CoCoT structures the reasoning process into three stages: perception (visual understanding), situation (contextual analysis), and norm (judgment based on social standards).

Result: CoCoT consistently outperformed flat CoT and direct prompting across multimodal benchmarks, improving performance by an average of 8%.

Conclusion: Structuring VLM reasoning into cognitive stages enhances interpretability, social awareness, and performance, advancing safer multimodal systems.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps models think step by step. But what
happens when they must see, understand, and judge-all at once? In visual tasks
grounded in social context, where bridging perception with norm-grounded
judgments is essential, flat CoT often breaks down. We introduce Cognitive
Chain-of-Thought (CoCoT), a prompting strategy that scaffolds VLM reasoning
through three cognitively inspired stages: perception, situation, and norm. Our
experiments show that, across multiple multimodal benchmarks (including intent
disambiguation, commonsense reasoning, and safety), CoCoT consistently
outperforms CoT and direct prompting (+8\% on average). Our findings
demonstrate that cognitively grounded reasoning stages enhance interpretability
and social awareness in VLMs, paving the way for safer and more reliable
multimodal systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CONCAP, a multilingual image captioning model that incorporates image-specific concepts along with retrieved examples to improve caption generation in various languages, achieving strong performance with reduced data requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual vision-language models underperform compared to English models due to limited multilingual training data and the high cost of large-scale model parameterization. The aim is to reduce these challenges while improving multilingual image captioning.

Method: The authors propose CONCAP, which combines retrieved captions and image-specific concepts to enhance the contextualization of input images and ground caption generation across languages. This retrieval-augmented approach avoids relying exclusively on English translations, reducing biases.

Result: CONCAP demonstrated strong performance in low- and mid-resource languages on the XM3600 dataset while requiring less training data. The model bridges the performance gaps in multilingual captioning effectively.

Conclusion: Integrating concept-aware retrieval augmentation significantly improves multilingual image captioning, offering a viable solution to performance and data limitations in multilingual vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Multilingual vision-language models have made significant strides in image
captioning, yet they still lag behind their English counterparts due to limited
multilingual training data and costly large-scale model parameterization.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising alternative by
conditioning caption generation on retrieved examples in the target language,
reducing the need for extensive multilingual training. However, multilingual
RAG captioning models often depend on retrieved captions translated from
English, which can introduce mismatches and linguistic biases relative to the
source language. We introduce CONCAP, a multilingual image captioning model
that integrates retrieved captions with image-specific concepts, enhancing the
contextualization of the input image and grounding the captioning process
across different languages. Experiments on the XM3600 dataset indicate that
CONCAP enables strong performance on low- and mid-resource languages, with
highly reduced data requirements. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of
concept-aware retrieval augmentation in bridging multilingual performance gaps.

*Khloud AL Jallad,Nada Ghneim,Ghaida Rebdawi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reviews various English, Arabic, and Multilingual NLU benchmarks, focusing on diagnostics datasets and linguistic phenomena. It identifies a lack of standard naming conventions and evaluation metrics and proposes ideas for standardization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gaps in evaluating NLU capabilities, particularly the lack of standardized naming conventions, linguistic phenomena categorization, and evaluation metrics for diagnostics benchmarks.

Method: Researchers conducted a comprehensive review, comparison, and analysis of NLU benchmarks, their diagnostic datasets, and linguistic phenomena to examine gaps and propose solutions for standardizing evaluation.

Result: The study revealed inconsistencies in naming conventions, linguistic phenomena categories, and the absence of standardized evaluation metrics for diagnostics benchmarks. It highlighted strengths and weaknesses of existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The authors propose the development of evaluation standards similar to ISO for NLU diagnostics benchmarks to enhance the reliability and comparability of model evaluations across different diagnostics datasets.

Abstract: Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a basic task in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). The evaluation of NLU capabilities has become a trending
research topic that attracts researchers in the last few years, resulting in
the development of numerous benchmarks. These benchmarks include various tasks
and datasets in order to evaluate the results of pretrained models via public
leaderboards. Notably, several benchmarks contain diagnostics datasets designed
for investigation and fine-grained error analysis across a wide range of
linguistic phenomena. This survey provides a comprehensive review of available
English, Arabic, and Multilingual NLU benchmarks, with a particular emphasis on
their diagnostics datasets and the linguistic phenomena they covered. We
present a detailed comparison and analysis of these benchmarks, highlighting
their strengths and limitations in evaluating NLU tasks and providing in-depth
error analysis. When highlighting the gaps in the state-of-the-art, we noted
that there is no naming convention for macro and micro categories or even a
standard set of linguistic phenomena that should be covered. Consequently, we
formulated a research question regarding the evaluation metrics of the
evaluation diagnostics benchmarks: "Why do not we have an evaluation standard
for the NLU evaluation diagnostics benchmarks?" similar to ISO standard in
industry. We conducted a deep analysis and comparisons of the covered
linguistic phenomena in order to support experts in building a global hierarchy
for linguistic phenomena in future. We think that having evaluation metrics for
diagnostics evaluation could be valuable to gain more insights when comparing
the results of the studied models on different diagnostics benchmarks.

*Sungwoo Han,Hyeyeon Kim,Jingun Kwon,Hidetaka Kamigaito,Manabu Okumura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a code-based prompting method for named entity recognition using large language models, achieving better results than text-based prompting across multiple languages and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NER tasks struggle with capturing detailed labeling requirements due to limitations in current LLM approaches that rely only on input context.

Method: Propose embedding code within prompts to deliver detailed BIO schema instructions, leveraging LLMs' comprehension of programming language structures.

Result: Experimental results show that code-based prompting outperforms conventional methods across ten benchmarks in English, Arabic, Finnish, Danish, and German.

Conclusion: Explicit structuring of NER instructions through code-based and chain-of-thought prompting improves large language models' performance in named entity recognition tasks.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored various approaches for treating candidate named
entity spans as both source and target sequences in named entity recognition
(NER) by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Although previous approaches
have successfully generated candidate named entity spans with suitable labels,
they rely solely on input context information when using LLMs, particularly,
ChatGPT. However, NER inherently requires capturing detailed labeling
requirements with input context information. To address this issue, we propose
a novel method that leverages code-based prompting to improve the capabilities
of LLMs in understanding and performing NER. By embedding code within prompts,
we provide detailed BIO schema instructions for labeling, thereby exploiting
the ability of LLMs to comprehend long-range scopes in programming languages.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed code-based prompting method
outperforms conventional text-based prompting on ten benchmarks across English,
Arabic, Finnish, Danish, and German datasets, indicating the effectiveness of
explicitly structuring NER instructions. We also verify that combining the
proposed code-based prompting method with the chain-of-thought prompting
further improves performance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Text-JEPA, a lightweight framework for converting natural language into first-order logic, aimed at improving reasoning accuracy in closed-domain QA systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Closed-domain QA systems in education, healthcare, and law require not only accurate answers but also transparent reasoning, which existing large-scale models struggle to provide efficiently.

Method: The authors developed Text-JEPA, based on dual-system cognitive theory, using System 1 for logic generation and the Z3 solver as System 2 for logical inference. They also created custom metrics to evaluate logical translation and reasoning quality.

Result: Text-JEPA achieved competitive reasoning performance on domain-specific datasets while operating with significantly reduced computational overhead compared to large LLM-based systems.

Conclusion: Text-JEPA represents a step forward in efficient, interpretable reasoning for specialized domains, offering a viable alternative to resource-intensive large-scale models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced
question-answering (QA) capabilities, particularly in open-domain contexts.
However, in closed-domain scenarios such as education, healthcare, and law,
users demand not only accurate answers but also transparent reasoning and
explainable decision-making processes. While neural-symbolic (NeSy) frameworks
have emerged as a promising solution, leveraging LLMs for natural language
understanding and symbolic systems for formal reasoning, existing approaches
often rely on large-scale models and exhibit inefficiencies in translating
natural language into formal logic representations.
  To address these limitations, we introduce Text-JEPA (Text-based
Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), a lightweight yet effective framework
for converting natural language into first-order logic (NL2FOL). Drawing
inspiration from dual-system cognitive theory, Text-JEPA emulates System 1 by
efficiently generating logic representations, while the Z3 solver operates as
System 2, enabling robust logical inference. To rigorously evaluate the
NL2FOL-to-reasoning pipeline, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework
comprising three custom metrics: conversion score, reasoning score, and
Spearman rho score, which collectively capture the quality of logical
translation and its downstream impact on reasoning accuracy.
  Empirical results on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that Text-JEPA
achieves competitive performance with significantly lower computational
overhead compared to larger LLM-based systems. Our findings highlight the
potential of structured, interpretable reasoning frameworks for building
efficient and explainable QA systems in specialized domains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAND-Math, a pipeline for generating high-quality and increasingly complex mathematical problems to improve the performance of large language models, achieving significant gains over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of high-quality, challenging mathematical data necessary for developing advanced large language models capable of mathematical reasoning.

Method: The proposed method, SAND-Math, generates new mathematical problems and makes them more complex using a novel Difficulty Hiking process, followed by evaluation through benchmarks and ablation studies.

Result: Incorporating SAND-Math data improved model performance by 17.85 points on the AIME25 benchmark and increased problem difficulty while boosting performance from 46.38% to 49.23%.

Conclusion: SAND-Math effectively creates and scales mathematical problem complexity, significantly improving the training of mathematical reasoning LLMs, and the dataset is made publicly available for further advancement.

Abstract: The demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of sophisticated
mathematical reasoning is growing across industries. However, the development
of performant mathematical LLMs is critically bottlenecked by the scarcity of
difficult, novel training data. We introduce \textbf{SAND-Math} (Synthetic
Augmented Novel and Difficult Mathematics problems and solutions), a pipeline
that addresses this by first generating high-quality problems from scratch and
then systematically elevating their complexity via a new \textbf{Difficulty
Hiking} step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two key
findings. First, augmenting a strong baseline with SAND-Math data significantly
boosts performance, outperforming the next-best synthetic dataset by
\textbf{$\uparrow$ 17.85 absolute points} on the AIME25 benchmark. Second, in a
dedicated ablation study, we show our Difficulty Hiking process is highly
effective: by increasing average problem difficulty from 5.02 to 5.98, this
step lifts AIME25 performance from 46.38\% to 49.23\%. The full generation
pipeline, final dataset, and a fine-tuned model form a practical and scalable
toolkit for building more capable and efficient mathematical reasoning LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce a novel multi-labeled scheme for joint annotation of hate and
counter-hate speech in social media conversations, categorizing hate and
counter-hate messages into thematic and rhetorical dimensions. The thematic
categories outline different discursive aspects of each type of speech, while
the rhetorical dimension captures how hate and counter messages are
communicated, drawing on Aristotle's Logos, Ethos and Pathos. We annotate a
sample of 92 conversations, consisting of 720 tweets, and conduct statistical
analyses, incorporating public metrics, to explore patterns of interaction
between the thematic and rhetorical dimensions within and between hate and
counter-hate speech. Our findings provide insights into the spread of hate
messages on social media, the strategies used to counter them, and their
potential impact on online behavior.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to detect hallucinations in text generated by black-box Large Language Models (LLMs) using future context sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of LLM-generated texts without transparency has heightened the need for reliable hallucination detection methods.

Method: The framework utilizes future context sampling, integrating it with existing sampling-based detection methods to identify hallucinations in black-box outputs.

Result: The proposed approach improves hallucination detection performance across various methods, as demonstrated through extensive evaluations.

Conclusion: Future context sampling is a promising technique for enhancing hallucination detection in black-box LLM-generated texts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to generate plausible text on
online platforms, without revealing the generation process. As users
increasingly encounter such black-box outputs, detecting hallucinations has
become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we focus on developing
a hallucination detection framework for black-box generators. Motivated by the
observation that hallucinations, once introduced, tend to persist, we sample
future contexts. The sampled future contexts provide valuable clues for
hallucination detection and can be effectively integrated with various
sampling-based methods. We extensively demonstrate performance improvements
across multiple methods using our proposed sampling approach.

TL;DR: This paper reviews 49 studies on predicting antisocial behavior (ASB) on social media, organizes methods into five task types, and identifies key challenges and research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the fragmented state of research on predicting antisocial behavior (ASB) on social media by synthesizing existing methods into a unified framework for better guidance and more effective interventions.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic review of 49 studies and developed a taxonomy comprising five core task types (early harm detection, harm emergence prediction, harm propagation prediction, behavioral risk prediction, and proactive moderation support). They also analyzed trends in modeling techniques and dataset characteristics.

Result: The review highlights key methodological issues like dataset scarcity, temporal drift, and lack of benchmarks, while offering a structured taxonomy for ASB prediction tasks and outlining emerging trends in the field.

Conclusion: By synthesizing fragmented research into a clear framework and identifying methodological challenges and future directions, the paper attempts to advance robust and socially responsible predictions of antisocial behavior on social media.

Abstract: Antisocial behavior (ASB) on social media-including hate speech, harassment,
and trolling-poses growing challenges for platform safety and societal
wellbeing. While prior work has primarily focused on detecting harmful content
after it appears, predictive approaches aim to forecast future harmful
behaviors-such as hate speech propagation, conversation derailment, or user
recidivism-before they fully unfold. Despite increasing interest, the field
remains fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy or clear synthesis of existing
methods. This paper presents a systematic review of over 49 studies on ASB
prediction, offering a structured taxonomy of five core task types: early harm
detection, harm emergence prediction, harm propagation prediction, behavioral
risk prediction, and proactive moderation support. We analyze how these tasks
differ by temporal framing, prediction granularity, and operational goals. In
addition, we examine trends in modeling techniques-from classical machine
learning to pre-trained language models-and assess the influence of dataset
characteristics on task feasibility and generalization. Our review highlights
methodological challenges, such as dataset scarcity, temporal drift, and
limited benchmarks, while outlining emerging research directions including
multilingual modeling, cross-platform generalization, and human-in-the-loop
systems. By organizing the field around a coherent framework, this survey aims
to guide future work toward more robust and socially responsible ASB
prediction.

*Wenbin Guo,Xin Wang,Jiaoyan Chen,Zhao Li,Zirui Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces OL-KGC, an ontology-enhanced method for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) using Large Language Models, which effectively combines neural-perceptual and ontological knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based KGC methods struggle with conclusive reasoning due to their reliance on implicit knowledge representation and erroneous parallel knowledge propagation.

Method: OL-KGC integrates neural-perceptual structural information and ontological knowledge. It uses neural perceptual mechanisms to embed structural info into text and automates the extraction and transformation of ontological knowledge into an LLM-friendly textual format.

Result: Evaluation on benchmarks FB15K-237, UMLS, and WN18RR shows that OL-KGC achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods on multiple metrics.

Conclusion: OL-KGC successfully advances KGC by combining LLM capabilities with a deeper understanding of knowledge logic, setting new efficiency standards in ontology-guided reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively adopted in Knowledge Graph
Completion (KGC), showcasing significant research advancements. However, as
black-box models driven by deep neural architectures, current LLM-based KGC
methods rely on implicit knowledge representation with parallel propagation of
erroneous knowledge, thereby hindering their ability to produce conclusive and
decisive reasoning outcomes. We aim to integrate neural-perceptual structural
information with ontological knowledge, leveraging the powerful capabilities of
LLMs to achieve a deeper understanding of the intrinsic logic of the knowledge.
We propose an ontology enhanced KGC method using LLMs -- OL-KGC. It first
leverages neural perceptual mechanisms to effectively embed structural
information into the textual space, and then uses an automated extraction
algorithm to retrieve ontological knowledge from the knowledge graphs (KGs)
that needs to be completed, which is further transformed into a textual format
comprehensible to LLMs for providing logic guidance. We conducted extensive
experiments on three widely-used benchmarks -- FB15K-237, UMLS and WN18RR. The
experimental results demonstrate that OL-KGC significantly outperforms existing
mainstream KGC methods across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization (GMPO), a more stable alternative to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), addressing instability from high variance in importance sampling ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address instabilities in GRPO caused by outlier importance-weighted rewards during training, creating a need for a more stable policy optimization method for token-level rewards.

Method: The proposed GMPO replaces optimization of arithmetic mean token-level rewards with maximizing their geometric mean, inherently reducing sensitivity to outliers and stabilizing importance sampling ratios.

Result: GMPO demonstrates significant performance improvements, with an average of 4.1% better results on mathematical benchmarks and 1.4% on multimodal reasoning benchmarks compared to GRPO.

Conclusion: GMPO offers a high-performing, stable advancement over GRPO, validated through theoretical and experimental analysis, and contributes to better reasoning capabilities in language models.

Abstract: Recent advancements, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models by optimizing the
arithmetic mean of token-level rewards. However, GRPO suffers from unstable
policy updates when processing tokens with outlier importance-weighted rewards,
which manifests as extreme importance sampling ratios during training, i.e.,
the ratio between the sampling probabilities assigned to a token by the current
and old policies. In this work, we propose Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization
(GMPO), a stabilized variant of GRPO. Instead of optimizing the arithmetic
mean, GMPO maximizes the geometric mean of token-level rewards, which is
inherently less sensitive to outliers and maintains a more stable range of
importance sampling ratio. In addition, we provide comprehensive theoretical
and experimental analysis to justify the design and stability benefits of GMPO.
Beyond improved stability, GMPO-7B outperforms GRPO by an average of 4.1% on
multiple mathematical benchmarks and 1.4% on multimodal reasoning benchmark,
including AIME24, AMC, MATH500, OlympiadBench, Minerva, and Geometry3K. Code is

*Hanna Shcharbakova,Tatiana Anikina,Natalia Skachkova,Josef van Genabith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the performance of five language models for multilingual fact verification, finding smaller models outperform larger ones on nuanced tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by multilingual misinformation spreading rapidly online and assess the performance of language models in nuanced multilingual fact verification.

Method: The study analyzed five state-of-the-art language models on the X-Fact dataset, investigating their performance using prompting and fine-tuning approaches.

Result: The XLM-R model (270M parameters) significantly outperformed larger LLMs (7-12B), achieving 57.7% macro-F1 compared to the best LLM result of 16.9%.

Conclusion: Smaller specialized models like XLM-R are more effective than general-purpose large models for multilingual fine-grained fact verification, with implications for practical system deployment.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multilingual misinformation requires robust automated
fact verification systems capable of handling fine-grained veracity assessments
across diverse languages. While large language models have shown remarkable
capabilities across many NLP tasks, their effectiveness for multilingual claim
verification with nuanced classification schemes remains understudied. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five state-of-the-art language models on
the X-Fact dataset, which spans 25 languages with seven distinct veracity
categories. Our experiments compare small language models (encoder-based XLM-R
and mT5) with recent decoder-only LLMs (Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, Mistral Nemo)
using both prompting and fine-tuning approaches. Surprisingly, we find that
XLM-R (270M parameters) substantially outperforms all tested LLMs (7-12B
parameters), achieving 57.7% macro-F1 compared to the best LLM performance of
16.9%. This represents a 15.8% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art
(41.9%), establishing new performance benchmarks for multilingual fact
verification. Our analysis reveals problematic patterns in LLM behavior,
including systematic difficulties in leveraging evidence and pronounced biases
toward frequent categories in imbalanced data settings. These findings suggest
that for fine-grained multilingual fact verification, smaller specialized
models may be more effective than general-purpose large models, with important
implications for practical deployment of fact-checking systems.

*Gabriel Downer,Sean Craven,Damian Ruck,Jake Thomas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text2VLM adapts text-only datasets into multimodal formats to test Visual Language Models' resilience against typographic prompt injection attacks and reveals vulnerabilities in existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation datasets focus largely on text-only prompts, underestimating visual vulnerabilities, hence needing better evaluation mechanisms for multimodal content in Visual Language Models.

Method: Text2VLM employs a multi-stage pipeline to transform harmful textual content into multimodal prompts, using typographic images for evaluation. Validation is carried out through human assessments of alignment with extracted concepts and text outputs.

Result: The evaluation shows open-source Visual Language Models are more vulnerable to prompt injection attacks when faced with visual inputs, and they trail behind closed-source models significantly in performance.

Conclusion: Text2VLM enhances safety assessment for VLMs by introducing robust tools for testing multimodal vulnerabilities, aiding in their secure application across real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The increasing integration of Visual Language Models (VLMs) into AI systems
necessitates robust model alignment, especially when handling multimodal
content that combines text and images. Existing evaluation datasets heavily
lean towards text-only prompts, leaving visual vulnerabilities under evaluated.
To address this gap, we propose \textbf{Text2VLM}, a novel multi-stage pipeline
that adapts text-only datasets into multimodal formats, specifically designed
to evaluate the resilience of VLMs against typographic prompt injection
attacks. The Text2VLM pipeline identifies harmful content in the original text
and converts it into a typographic image, creating a multimodal prompt for
VLMs. Also, our evaluation of open-source VLMs highlights their increased
susceptibility to prompt injection when visual inputs are introduced, revealing
critical weaknesses in the current models' alignment. This is in addition to a
significant performance gap compared to closed-source frontier models. We
validate Text2VLM through human evaluations, ensuring the alignment of
extracted salient concepts; text summarization and output classification align
with human expectations. Text2VLM provides a scalable tool for comprehensive
safety assessment, contributing to the development of more robust safety
mechanisms for VLMs. By enhancing the evaluation of multimodal vulnerabilities,
Text2VLM plays a role in advancing the safe deployment of VLMs in diverse,
real-world applications.

### [124] [Investigating Structural Pruning and Recovery Techniques for Compressing Multimodal Large Language Models: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20749)
*Yiran Huang,Lukas Thede,Massimiliano Mancini,Wenjia Xu,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces structural pruning combined with recovery training to reduce the computational demands of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), achieving effective compression and performance recovery even with limited resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying MLLMs is challenging due to their high computational and memory requirements, and current solutions for parameter reduction are either inflexible or computationally expensive.

Method: The study investigates structural pruning techniques (layerwise and widthwise) applied to the language model backbone, paired with recovery training methods like supervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. It also tests recovery training using a small fraction of data.

Result: Widthwise pruning performs better in low-resource scenarios, and compression below 20% can use finetuning on the multimodal projector alone. Combining supervised finetuning with hidden-state distillation optimizes recovery, retaining over 95% performance with just 5% of original data.

Conclusion: Structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training provides a practical approach for compressing MLLMs, enabling significant resource savings while maintaining high performance, thus making MLLMs more accessible for deployment.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive
capabilities, their substantial computational and memory requirements pose
significant barriers to practical deployment. Current parameter reduction
techniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),
but these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally
intensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs
through structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.
Specifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and
widthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside
supervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the
feasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the
available data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains
better performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational
resources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,
finetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression
levels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and
hidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning
levels. Notably, effective recovery can be achieved with as little as 5% of the
original training data, while retaining over 95% of the original performance.
Through empirical study on two representative MLLMs, i.e., LLaVA-v1.5-7B and
Bunny-v1.0-3B, this study offers actionable insights for practitioners aiming
to compress MLLMs effectively without extensive computation resources or
sufficient data.

*Carlo Alfano,Aymen Al Marjani,Zeno Jonke,Amin Mantrach,Saab Mansour,Marcello Federico*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework aimed at evaluating multilingual text faithfulness in large language models (LLMs), using only synthetic multilingual training data and cross-lingual transfer learning, avoiding costly human-labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of multilingual usage in LLMs has highlighted the shortcomings of current faithfulness evaluation methods which are predominantly English-centric and require expensive labeled training datasets. This gap necessitates universal evaluators that are efficient and scalable across languages.

Method: The proposed framework uses synthetic multilingual data and applies cross-lingual transfer learning to evaluate faithfulness in text produced by LLMs. Experiments with both language-specific and mixed-language approaches were conducted to assess its effectiveness.

Result: The framework consistently correlates an LLM's general language capacity with its evaluation performance in language-specific tasks. It surpasses existing baselines, including expert English evaluators and machine translation-based systems.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the viability of leveraging synthetic multilingual data for improving cross-language text evaluation tasks, establishing an efficient alternative for faithfulness evaluation without relying on human-labeled datasets.

Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) has increased the need for
automatic evaluation systems, particularly to address the challenge of
information hallucination. Although existing faithfulness evaluation approaches
have shown promise, they are predominantly English-focused and often require
expensive human-labeled training data for fine-tuning specialized models. As
LLMs see increased adoption in multilingual contexts, there is a need for
accurate faithfulness evaluators that can operate across languages without
extensive labeled data. This paper presents Self-Taught Evaluators for
Multilingual Faithfulness, a framework that learns exclusively from synthetic
multilingual summarization data while leveraging cross-lingual transfer
learning. Through experiments comparing language-specific and mixed-language
fine-tuning approaches, we demonstrate a consistent relationship between an
LLM's general language capabilities and its performance in language-specific
evaluation tasks. Our framework shows improvements over existing baselines,
including state-of-the-art English evaluators and machine translation-based
approaches.

TL;DR: The paper reviews General-Purpose Text Embeddings (GPTE) and their development with Pretrained Language Models (PLMs), analyzing architecture, roles, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the growing interest in GPTE due to their utility across various NLP tasks and explore how PLMs are pivotal in their evolution.

Method: The authors provide a survey of GPTE, examining fundamental and advanced roles of PLMs, and discuss future research directions to enhance GPTE.

Result: The paper identifies key aspects of GPTE's architecture, training strategies, and applications, while highlighting advancements enabled by PLMs and unmet needs.

Conclusion: This work serves as a useful guide to understanding GPTE's current landscape and future research opportunities, benefiting both beginners and experts in the field.

Abstract: Text embeddings have attracted growing interest due to their effectiveness
across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as
retrieval, classification, clustering, bitext mining, and summarization. With
the emergence of pretrained language models (PLMs), general-purpose text
embeddings (GPTE) have gained significant traction for their ability to produce
rich, transferable representations. The general architecture of GPTE typically
leverages PLMs to derive dense text representations, which are then optimized
through contrastive learning on large-scale pairwise datasets. In this survey,
we provide a comprehensive overview of GPTE in the era of PLMs, focusing on the
roles PLMs play in driving its development. We first examine the fundamental
architecture and describe the basic roles of PLMs in GPTE, i.e., embedding
extraction, expressivity enhancement, training strategies, learning objectives,
and data construction. Then, we describe advanced roles enabled by PLMs, such
as multilingual support, multimodal integration, code understanding, and
scenario-specific adaptation. Finally, we highlight potential future research
directions that move beyond traditional improvement goals, including ranking
integration, safety considerations, bias mitigation, structural information
incorporation, and the cognitive extension of embeddings. This survey aims to
serve as a valuable reference for both newcomers and established researchers
seeking to understand the current state and future potential of GPTE.

### [127] [Automating Thematic Review of Prevention of Future Deaths Reports: Replicating the ONS Child Suicide Study using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20786)
*Sam Osian,Arpan Dutta,Sahil Bhandari,Iain E. Buchan,Dan W. Joyce*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents the PFD Toolkit, an automated language-model-based pipeline, which effectively replicates and surpasses a previous manual effort in analyzing child-suicide PFD reports, significantly improving speed and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual identification and analysis of PFD reports by coroners in England and Wales is a slow and labor-intensive process, which limits the ability to generate timely insights for public health and safety.

Method: The paper assessed a fully automated, open-source "text-to-table" language-model pipeline called the PFD Toolkit. The pipeline analyzed over 4,000 reports, identified child-suicide-related PFD reports, and performed coding for relevant categories and themes, benchmarking against previous manual methods.

Result: The PFD Toolkit identified 72 child-suicide PFD reports, almost double the count identified manually by the ONS. It exhibited strong agreement with clinical annotations (Cohen's κ = 0.82) and completed the task in only 8 minutes and 16 seconds, compared to months of manual work.

Conclusion: Automated LLM analysis via the PFD Toolkit can efficiently and reliably replicate manual thematic reviews of coronial data. This represents a significant advance in generating rapid, scalable, and reproducible public health analyses, and the toolkit is openly available for future use.

Abstract: Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) reports, issued by coroners in England and
Wales, flag systemic hazards that may lead to further loss of life. Analysis of
these reports has previously been constrained by the manual effort required to
identify and code relevant cases. In 2025, the Office for National Statistics
(ONS) published a national thematic review of child-suicide PFD reports ($\leq$
18 years), identifying 37 cases from January 2015 to November 2023 - a process
based entirely on manual curation and coding. We evaluated whether a fully
automated, open source "text-to-table" language-model pipeline (PFD Toolkit)
could reproduce the ONS's identification and thematic analysis of child-suicide
PFD reports, and assessed gains in efficiency and reliability. All 4,249 PFD
reports published from July 2013 to November 2023 were processed via PFD
Toolkit's large language model pipelines. Automated screening identified cases
where the coroner attributed death to suicide in individuals aged 18 or
younger, and eligible reports were coded for recipient category and 23 concern
sub-themes, replicating the ONS coding frame. PFD Toolkit identified 72
child-suicide PFD reports - almost twice the ONS count. Three blinded
clinicians adjudicated a stratified sample of 144 reports to validate the
child-suicide screening. Against the post-consensus clinical annotations, the
LLM-based workflow showed substantial to almost-perfect agreement (Cohen's
$\kappa$ = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, raw agreement = 91%). The end-to-end script
runtime was 8m 16s, transforming a process that previously took months into one
that can be completed in minutes. This demonstrates that automated LLM analysis
can reliably and efficiently replicate manual thematic reviews of coronial
data, enabling scalable, reproducible, and timely insights for public health
and safety. The PFD Toolkit is openly available for future research.

*Yilun Qiu,Tianhao Shi,Xiaoyan Zhao,Fengbin Zhu,Yang Zhang,Fuli Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents DEP, a personalization framework that uses embeddings instead of prompts to model inter-user differences, achieving better performance in personalized review generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for personalized output in LLMs has grown, but current approaches fail to effectively capture inter-user differences due to the reliance on language-based prompts.

Method: DEP utilizes embeddings to model inter-user differences by constructing soft prompts based on contrasting user and peer data, and employs a sparse autoencoder for filtering task-relevant features before integrating with a frozen LLM.

Result: DEP consistently surpasses baseline methods in personalized review generation across multiple performance metrics.

Conclusion: Embedding-based personalization effectively captures inter-user differences and improves LLM personalization, evidenced by DEP's superior performance. Its codebase is openly available for public use.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into users' daily
lives, leading to a growing demand for personalized outputs. Previous work
focuses on leveraging a user's own history, overlooking inter-user differences
that are crucial for effective personalization. While recent work has attempted
to model such differences, the reliance on language-based prompts often hampers
the effective extraction of meaningful distinctions. To address these issues,
we propose Difference-aware Embedding-based Personalization (DEP), a framework
that models inter-user differences in the latent space instead of relying on
language prompts. DEP constructs soft prompts by contrasting a user's embedding
with those of peers who engaged with similar content, highlighting relative
behavioral signals. A sparse autoencoder then filters and compresses both
user-specific and difference-aware embeddings, preserving only task-relevant
features before injecting them into a frozen LLM. Experiments on personalized
review generation show that DEP consistently outperforms baseline methods
across multiple metrics. Our code is available at
https://github.com/SnowCharmQ/DEP.

*Louis Estève,Marie-Catherine de Marneffe,Nurit Melnik,Agata Savary,Olha Kanishcheva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how 'diversity' is conceptualized and measured in Natural Language Processing (NLP), proposing a unified taxonomy and framework inspired by ecology and economy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising attention towards diversity in NLP due to motivations like inclusion, linguistic behavior approximation, and improved system performance.

Method: The authors survey NLP articles over six years, classify diversity-related studies using an ecology-based framework with dimensions such as variety, balance, and disparity.

Result: Identified inconsistent usage of diversity metrics and terminology across studies, providing a structured taxonomy and insights.

Conclusion: A systematized approach to diversity enhances its formalization, comparability, and understanding within the NLP domain.

Abstract: The concept of diversity has received increased consideration in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) in recent years. This is due to various motivations
like promoting and inclusion, approximating human linguistic behavior, and
increasing systems' performance. Diversity has however often been addressed in
an ad hoc manner in NLP, and with few explicit links to other domains where
this notion is better theorized. We survey articles in the ACL Anthology from
the past 6 years, with "diversity" or "diverse" in their title. We find a wide
range of settings in which diversity is quantified, often highly specialized
and using inconsistent terminology. We put forward a unified taxonomy of why,
what on, where, and how diversity is measured in NLP. Diversity measures are
cast upon a unified framework from ecology and economy (Stirling, 2007) with 3
dimensions of diversity: variety, balance and disparity. We discuss the trends
which emerge due to this systematized approach. We believe that this study
paves the way towards a better formalization of diversity in NLP, which should
bring a better understanding of this notion and a better comparability between
various approaches.

### [130] [Leveraging Open-Source Large Language Models for Clinical Information Extraction in Resource-Constrained Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20859)
*Luc Builtjes,Joeran Bosma,Mathias Prokop,Bram van Ginneken,Alessa Hering*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates nine open-source generative large language models (LLMs) for clinical information extraction on the DRAGON benchmark in Dutch and introduces the "llm_extractinator" framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of extracting information from unstructured medical reports written in domain-specific language, while also addressing data privacy concerns and the lack of transparency associated with proprietary LLMs.

Method: The researchers developed "llm_extractinator," a publicly available framework for information extraction using nine open-source generative LLMs, and evaluated their zero-shot performance on 28 clinical extraction tasks in Dutch.

Result: 14 billion parameter models (Phi-4-14B, Qwen-2.5-14B, and DeepSeek-R1-14B) delivered competitive results, while the larger Llama-3.3-70B achieved slightly better performance at a higher computational cost. Translation to English consistently lowered performance.

Conclusion: Open-source LLMs coupled with the new framework provide effective, scalable, and privacy-preserving solutions for clinical information extraction, particularly for low-resource language settings.

Abstract: Medical reports contain rich clinical information but are often unstructured
and written in domain-specific language, posing challenges for information
extraction. While proprietary large language models (LLMs) have shown promise
in clinical natural language processing, their lack of transparency and data
privacy concerns limit their utility in healthcare. This study therefore
evaluates nine open-source generative LLMs on the DRAGON benchmark, which
includes 28 clinical information extraction tasks in Dutch. We developed
\texttt{llm\_extractinator}, a publicly available framework for information
extraction using open-source generative LLMs, and used it to assess model
performance in a zero-shot setting. Several 14 billion parameter models,
Phi-4-14B, Qwen-2.5-14B, and DeepSeek-R1-14B, achieved competitive results,
while the bigger Llama-3.3-70B model achieved slightly higher performance at
greater computational cost. Translation to English prior to inference
consistently degraded performance, highlighting the need of native-language
processing. These findings demonstrate that open-source LLMs, when used with
our framework, offer effective, scalable, and privacy-conscious solutions for
clinical information extraction in low-resource settings.

### [131] [Soft Injection of Task Embeddings Outperforms Prompt-Based In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20906)
*Jungwon Park,Wonjong Rhee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method called Soft Injection of task embeddings to improve Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiency and performance compared to traditional in-context learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing in-context learning (ICL) methods are inefficient in conveying task information as they depend on input-output prompts, consuming resources during inference.

Method: The authors introduce Soft Injection, where task embeddings (constructed from few-shot ICL prompts) are softly mixed with attention head activations using optimized mixing parameters during inference.

Result: The Soft Injection method outperformed 10-shot ICL by 10.1%-13.9% across 12 different LLMs and reduced memory usage and computational cost.

Conclusion: Soft Injection reduces prompt length, boosts task performance, and shifts task conditioning from prompt space to activation space, offering insights into task-relevant functionality of attention heads.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
tasks by conditioning on input-output examples in the prompt, without requiring
any update in model parameters. While widely adopted, it remains unclear
whether prompting with multiple examples is the most effective and efficient
way to convey task information. In this work, we propose Soft Injection of task
embeddings. The task embeddings are constructed only once using few-shot ICL
prompts and repeatedly used during inference. Soft injection is performed by
softly mixing task embeddings with attention head activations using
pre-optimized mixing parameters, referred to as soft head-selection parameters.
This method not only allows a desired task to be performed without in-prompt
demonstrations but also significantly outperforms existing ICL approaches while
reducing memory usage and compute cost at inference time. An extensive
evaluation is performed across 57 tasks and 12 LLMs, spanning four model
families of sizes from 4B to 70B. Averaged across 57 tasks, our method
outperforms 10-shot ICL by 10.1%-13.9% across 12 LLMs. Additional analyses show
that our method also serves as an insightful tool for analyzing task-relevant
roles of attention heads, revealing that task-relevant head positions selected
by our method transfer across similar tasks but not across dissimilar ones --
underscoring the task-specific nature of head functionality. Our soft injection
method opens a new paradigm for reducing prompt length and improving task
performance by shifting task conditioning from the prompt space to the
activation space.

Motivation: To address the lack of multilingual resources in the medical domain by creating a benchmark dataset for evaluating language models’ understanding and reasoning capabilities in answering French medical questions.

Method: The dataset contains questions from French medical examinations across 41 subjects, categorized into three tasks (Multiple-Choice Unique, Multiple-Choice Multiple, Open-Ended Short-Answer) and labeled as Understanding or Reasoning.

Result: Evaluation of 14 language models reveals a large performance gap between factual recall and reasoning tasks, highlighting areas for improvement.

Conclusion: MediQAl provides a valuable benchmark for assessing medical QA in French and lays groundwork for further multilingual research in medical AI.

Abstract: This work introduces MediQAl, a French medical question answering dataset
designed to evaluate the capabilities of language models in factual medical
recall and reasoning over real-world clinical scenarios. MediQAl contains
32,603 questions sourced from French medical examinations across 41 medical
subjects. The dataset includes three tasks: (i) Multiple-Choice Question with
Unique answer, (ii) Multiple-Choice Question with Multiple answer, and (iii)
Open-Ended Question with Short-Answer. Each question is labeled as
Understanding or Reasoning, enabling a detailed analysis of models' cognitive
capabilities. We validate the MediQAl dataset through extensive evaluation with
14 large language models, including recent reasoning-augmented models, and
observe a significant performance gap between factual recall and reasoning
tasks. Our evaluation provides a comprehensive benchmark for assessing language
models' performance on French medical question answering, addressing a crucial
gap in multilingual resources for the medical domain.

*Roberto Labadie-Tamayo,Adrian Jaques Böck,Djordje Slijepčević,Xihui Chen,Andreas Babic,Matthias Zeppelzauer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper tackles sexism detection in social media posts as part of the EXIST challenge at CLEF 2025, presenting models that balance classification performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the widespread problem of sexism in social media by developing robust detection methods.

Method: Three models are introduced: Speech Concept Bottleneck Model (SCBM), SCBM with Transformer (SCBMT), and a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa, leveraging linguistic concepts for interpretability and improving detection performance.

Result: Fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa ranks in competitive positions (6th and 4th) in English and Spanish evaluations, with SCBMT also performing notably (7th and 6th).

Conclusion: The models provide effective sexism detection in texts with added interpretability through linguistic insights, contributing to the EXIST challenge in multilingual settings.

Abstract: Sexism has become widespread on social media and in online conversation. To
help address this issue, the fifth Sexism Identification in Social Networks
(EXIST) challenge is initiated at CLEF 2025. Among this year's international
benchmarks, we concentrate on solving the first task aiming to identify and
classify sexism in social media textual posts. In this paper, we describe our
solutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism
Identification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask
1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address
each subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck
Model (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a
fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as
human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models
(LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of
adjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks.
SCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual
embeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification
performance. Beyond competitive results, these two models offer fine-grained
explanations at both instance (local) and class (global) levels. We also
investigate how additional metadata, e.g., annotators' demographic profiles,
can be leveraged. For Subtask 1.1, XLM-RoBERTa, fine-tuned on provided data
augmented with prior datasets, ranks 6th for English and Spanish and 4th for
English in the Soft-Soft evaluation. Our SCBMT achieves 7th for English and
Spanish and 6th for Spanish.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses hallucinations in large language models by creating a framework to detect and edit factual inaccuracies in model-generated outputs, achieving significant performance improvements in the financial domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in AI models present a risk to factual reliability, especially in critical domains like finance; hence, the need for robust methods to detect and correct inaccuracies.

Method: The researchers created a synthetic dataset using a domain-specific error taxonomy, fine-tuned four models for error detection and correction, and evaluated their performance on financial corpora.

Result: The fine-tuned Phi-4 model improved binary F1 score by 8% and overall detection by 30% compared to OpenAI-o3. The smaller Phi-4-mini model also performed well, with minimal performance degradation.

Conclusion: This work offers an effective, generalizable framework for improving factual accuracy in model-generated text, enhancing the reliability of AI applications in finance and other domains.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models pose a critical challenge for
applications requiring factual reliability, particularly in high-stakes domains
such as finance. This work presents an effective approach for detecting and
editing factually incorrect content in model-generated responses based on the
provided context. Given a user-defined domain-specific error taxonomy, we
construct a synthetic dataset by inserting tagged errors into financial
question-answering corpora and then fine-tune four language models, Phi-4,
Phi-4-mini, Qwen3-4B, and Qwen3-14B, to detect and edit these factual
inaccuracies. Our best-performing model, fine-tuned Phi-4, achieves an 8%
improvement in binary F1 score and a 30% gain in overall detection performance
compared to OpenAI-o3. Notably, our fine-tuned Phi-4-mini model, despite having
only 4 billion parameters, maintains competitive performance with just a 2%
drop in binary detection and a 0.1% decline in overall detection compared to
OpenAI-o3. Our work provides a practical solution for detecting and editing
factual inconsistencies in financial text generation while introducing a
generalizable framework that can enhance the trustworthiness and alignment of
large language models across diverse applications beyond finance. Our code and
data are available at https://github.com/pegasi-ai/fine-grained-editting.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Instruction-tuning reduces diversity in outputs of large language models, significantly impacting creative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how instruction-tuning affects output diversity and address the diversity gap in tasks requiring creativity.

Method: Analyzed diversity metrics across fine-tuning stages and proposed conformative decoding to reintroduce output diversity.

Result: Conformative decoding increased output diversity while maintaining or improving text quality.

Conclusion: Instruction-tuning impacts diversity, but conformative decoding is effective in enhancing diversity without sacrificing output quality.

Abstract: Instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) reduces the diversity of
their outputs, which has implications for many tasks, particularly for creative
tasks. This paper investigates the ``diversity gap'' for a writing prompt
narrative generation task. This gap emerges as measured by current diversity
metrics for various open-weight and open-source LLMs. The results show
significant decreases in diversity due to instruction-tuning. We explore the
diversity loss at each fine-tuning stage for the OLMo and OLMo 2 models to
further understand how output diversity is affected. The results indicate that
DPO has the most substantial impact on diversity. Motivated by these findings,
we present a new decoding strategy, conformative decoding, which guides an
instruct model using its more diverse base model to reintroduce output
diversity. We show that conformative decoding typically increases diversity and
even maintains or improves quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies how fine-tuning impacts data memorization in LLMs, focusing on privacy-sensitive medical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate privacy risks introduced by data memorization in fine-tuned LLMs, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare.

Method: Utilized membership inference attacks and generation tasks using prompted prefixes to measure memorization. Examined the influence of specific transformer weight matrices, perplexity, and LoRA rank adjustments.

Result: (1) Value/Output matrices contribute more to memorization than Query/Key matrices, (2) Lower perplexity links to greater memorization, (3) Higher LoRA rank amplifies memorization, but gains taper off.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the trade-off between improving model performance and increasing privacy risks, offering insights to guide responsible fine-tuning methods for LLMs.

Abstract: This study investigates the mechanisms and factors influencing memorization
in fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), with a focus on the medical domain
due to its privacy-sensitive nature. We examine how different aspects of the
fine-tuning process affect a model's propensity to memorize training data,
using the PHEE dataset of pharmacovigilance events.
  Our research employs two main approaches: a membership inference attack to
detect memorized data, and a generation task with prompted prefixes to assess
verbatim reproduction. We analyze the impact of adapting different weight
matrices in the transformer architecture, the relationship between perplexity
and memorization, and the effect of increasing the rank in low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) fine-tuning.
  Key findings include: (1) Value and Output matrices contribute more
significantly to memorization compared to Query and Key matrices; (2) Lower
perplexity in the fine-tuned model correlates with increased memorization; (3)
Higher LoRA ranks lead to increased memorization, but with diminishing returns
at higher ranks.
  These results provide insights into the trade-offs between model performance
and privacy risks in fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings have implications for
developing more effective and responsible strategies for adapting large
language models while managing data privacy concerns.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MAJ-EVAL, a framework for creating AI-based evaluator personas to simulate human evaluation across multiple dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human evaluations in NLP applications require multi-dimensional perspectives, but real human evaluators are scarce and expensive.

Method: MAJ-EVAL constructs diverse AI personas using relevant documents, instantiates LLM agents, and facilitates debates to generate evaluative feedback.

Result: In education and medical domains, MAJ-EVAL outperformed standard automated metrics and existing LLM-as-a-judge methods in aligning with human expert ratings.

Conclusion: MAJ-EVAL enhances the believability and generalizability of AI-based evaluative frameworks via multi-agent debates and automatic persona construction.

Abstract: Nearly all human work is collaborative; thus, the evaluation of real-world
NLP applications often requires multiple dimensions that align with diverse
human perspectives. As real human evaluator resources are often scarce and
costly, the emerging "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm sheds light on a promising
approach to leverage LLM agents to believably simulate human evaluators. Yet,
to date, existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches face two limitations: persona
descriptions of agents are often arbitrarily designed, and the frameworks are
not generalizable to other tasks. To address these challenges, we propose
MAJ-EVAL, a Multi-Agent-as-Judge evaluation framework that can automatically
construct multiple evaluator personas with distinct dimensions from relevant
text documents (e.g., research papers), instantiate LLM agents with the
personas, and engage in-group debates with multi-agents to Generate
multi-dimensional feedback. Our evaluation experiments in both the educational
and medical domains demonstrate that MAJ-EVAL can generate evaluation results
that better align with human experts' ratings compared with conventional
automated evaluation metrics and existing LLM-as-a-judge methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Tuning Adaptive Gamma Correction (TAGC) model for enhancing low-light images by calculating adaptive gamma coefficients automatically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the challenge of low-quality images caused by insufficient illumination, such as noise, low contrast, and blurred details.

Method: TAGC analyzes an image's color luminance to calculate an adaptive gamma coefficient automatically, adjusting illumination levels without manual input.

Result: The model successfully enhances low-light images, improving contrast, detail retention, and color distribution, while maintaining natural visual quality.

Conclusion: TAGC is an efficient and automated solution applicable in areas like night surveillance, medical imaging, and low-light photography.

Abstract: Enhancing images in low-light conditions is an important challenge in
computer vision. Insufficient illumination negatively affects the quality of
images, resulting in low contrast, intensive noise, and blurred details. This
paper presents a model for enhancing low-light images called tuning adaptive
gamma correction (TAGC). The model is based on analyzing the color luminance of
the low-light image and calculating the average color to determine the adaptive
gamma coefficient. The gamma value is calculated automatically and adaptively
at different illumination levels suitable for the image without human
intervention or manual adjustment. Based on qualitative and quantitative
evaluation, tuning adaptive gamma correction model has effectively improved
low-light images while maintaining details, natural contrast, and correct color
distribution. It also provides natural visual quality. It can be considered a
more efficient solution for processing low-light images in multiple
applications such as night surveillance, improving the quality of medical
images, and photography in low-light environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the data scarcity challenges in medical imaging, particularly the 'Data Addition Dilemma' affecting deep learning models due to distributional shifts. They propose a method controlling feature discrepancies for segmentation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of data scarcity in medical imaging, especially the performance deterioration ('Data Addition Dilemma') caused by pooling datasets from different sources.

Method: The proposed method uses causal frameworks to manage foreground-background feature discrepancies across deep network layers, enhancing representation in data pooling scenarios.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art segmentation performance on five medical imaging datasets, including a novel ultrasound dataset, showing improved accuracy and qualitative segmentation maps.

Conclusion: Controlling feature discrepancies is effective in addressing data addition challenges and improving segmentation outcomes in multi-source medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Data scarcity is a major challenge in medical imaging, particularly for deep
learning models. While data pooling (combining datasets from multiple sources)
and data addition (adding more data from a new dataset) have been shown to
enhance model performance, they are not without complications. Specifically,
increasing the size of the training dataset through pooling or addition can
induce distributional shifts, negatively affecting downstream model
performance, a phenomenon known as the "Data Addition Dilemma". While the
traditional i.i.d. assumption may not hold in multi-source contexts, assuming
exchangeability across datasets provides a more practical framework for data
pooling. In this work, we investigate medical image segmentation under these
conditions, drawing insights from causal frameworks to propose a method for
controlling foreground-background feature discrepancies across all layers of
deep networks. This approach improves feature representations, which are
crucial in data-addition scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
segmentation performance on histopathology and ultrasound images across five
datasets, including a novel ultrasound dataset that we have curated and
contributed. Qualitative results demonstrate more refined and accurate
segmentation maps compared to prominent baselines across three model
architectures. The code will be available on Github.

TL;DR: This paper introduces T-MPEDNet, a Transformer-based deep learning model, to enhance automated liver and tumor segmentation in CT scans, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated liver and tumor segmentation in CT scans is challenging due to tumor heterogeneity and diverse liver characteristics across patients, requiring advanced solutions for precise diagnosis and treatment planning.

Method: The study develops T-MPEDNet, a Transformer-based multiscale encoder-decoder network with dynamic attention, progressive feature learning, and boundary refinement techniques to improve segmentation accuracy.

Result: On benchmark datasets LiTS and 3DIRCADb, T-MPEDNet achieves highly accurate Dice Similarity Coefficients, surpassing twelve state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: T-MPEDNet is a robust and effective framework for automated liver and tumor segmentation, offering a promising tool for clinical applications.

Abstract: Precise and automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor within CT scans
plays a pivotal role in swift diagnosis and the development of optimal
treatment plans for individuals with liver diseases and malignancies. However,
automated liver and tumor segmentation faces significant hurdles arising from
the inherent heterogeneity of tumors and the diverse visual characteristics of
livers across a broad spectrum of patients. Aiming to address these challenges,
we present a novel Transformer-aware Multiscale Progressive Encoder-Decoder
Network (T-MPEDNet) for automated segmentation of tumor and liver. T-MPEDNet
leverages a deep adaptive features backbone through a progressive
encoder-decoder structure, enhanced by skip connections for recalibrating
channel-wise features while preserving spatial integrity. A
Transformer-inspired dynamic attention mechanism captures long-range contextual
relationships within the spatial domain, further enhanced by multi-scale
feature utilization for refined local details, leading to accurate prediction.
Morphological boundary refinement is then employed to address indistinct
boundaries with neighboring organs, capturing finer details and yielding
precise boundary labels. The efficacy of T-MPEDNet is comprehensively assessed
on two widely utilized public benchmark datasets, LiTS and 3DIRCADb. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the superiority of T-MPEDNet
compared to twelve state-of-the-art methods. On LiTS, T-MPEDNet achieves
outstanding Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 97.6% and 89.1% for liver and
tumor segmentation, respectively. Similar performance is observed on 3DIRCADb,
with DSCs of 98.3% and 83.3% for liver and tumor segmentation, respectively.
Our findings prove that T-MPEDNet is an efficacious and reliable framework for
automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor in CT scans.

*Meng Wei,Charlie Budd,Oluwatosin Alabi,Miaojing Shi,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SurgPIS, a novel part-aware instance segmentation (PIS) model for surgical instruments, which unifies both instance-level and part-level segmentation tasks with a transformer-based approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing methods for segmenting surgical instruments separately address instance-level (IIS) or part-level (PSS) segmentation, lacking interaction between these tasks. A unified approach is necessary for consistent segmentation, which is crucial for robot-assisted surgery.

Method: The method involves a unified part-aware instance segmentation (PIS) with a transformer-based mask classification system. Part-specific queries link parts to parent instances. A weakly-supervised learning strategy allows training on datasets labeled either for IIS or PSS by aggregating PIS predictions and implementing a student-teacher approach for partial labeling.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that SurgPIS achieves state-of-the-art performance in part-aware instance segmentation (PIS) and performs strongly in IIS, PSS, and instrument-level semantic segmentation across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: SurgPIS successfully addresses the lack of interaction between instance-level and part-level surgical instrument segmentation. The weakly-supervised learning and transformer-based design make it effective and versatile for surgical automation tasks.

Abstract: Consistent surgical instrument segmentation is critical for automation in
robot-assisted surgery. Yet, existing methods only treat instrument-level
instance segmentation (IIS) or part-level semantic segmentation (PSS)
separately, without interaction between these tasks. In this work, we formulate
a surgical tool segmentation as a unified part-aware instance segmentation
(PIS) problem and introduce SurgPIS, the first PIS model for surgical
instruments. Our method adopts a transformer-based mask classification approach
and introduces part-specific queries derived from instrument-level object
queries, explicitly linking parts to their parent instrument instances. In
order to address the lack of large-scale datasets with both instance- and
part-level labels, we propose a weakly-supervised learning strategy for SurgPIS
to learn from disjoint datasets labelled for either IIS or PSS purposes. During
training, we aggregate our PIS predictions into IIS or PSS masks, thereby
allowing us to compute a loss against partially labelled datasets. A
student-teacher approach is developed to maintain prediction consistency for
missing PIS information in the partially labelled data, e.g., parts of the IIS
labelled data. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the
effectiveness of SurgPIS, achieving state-of-the-art performance in PIS as well
as IIS, PSS, and instrument-level semantic segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the generalization of encoding models for mapping cortical parcel activities from fMRI data by leveraging multimodal pretrained models.

Method: Used multimodal state-of-the-art pretrained models (e.g., V-JEPA2 for video, Whisper for speech) as feature extractors, followed by latent space projection, temporal alignment, and mapping to cortical parcels using an ensemble-based lightweight encoder framework.

Result: Achieved a mean Pearson correlation score of 0.2085 on withheld out-of-distribution movies, placing 4th in the competition.

Conclusion: Combining multimodal pretrained features with a simple architecture and comprehensive model selection significantly enhances the generalization of brain encoding models.

Abstract: We present MedARC's team solution to the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Our
pipeline leveraged rich multimodal representations from various
state-of-the-art pretrained models across video (V-JEPA2), speech (Whisper),
text (Llama 3.2), vision-text (InternVL3), and vision-text-audio
(Qwen2.5-Omni). These features extracted from the models were linearly
projected to a latent space, temporally aligned to the fMRI time series, and
finally mapped to cortical parcels through a lightweight encoder comprising a
shared group head plus subject-specific residual heads. We trained hundreds of
model variants across hyperparameter settings, validated them on held-out
movies and assembled ensembles targeted to each parcel in each subject. Our
final submission achieved a mean Pearson's correlation of 0.2085 on the test
split of withheld out-of-distribution movies, placing our team in fourth place
for the competition. We further discuss a last-minute optimization that would
have raised us to second place. Our results highlight how combining features
from models trained in different modalities, using a simple architecture
consisting of shared-subject and single-subject components, and conducting
comprehensive model selection and ensembling improves generalization of
encoding models to novel movie stimuli. All code is available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a VideoLLM model capable of both textual and visual prompt-based video interaction, leveraging a proposed STOM module and a curated dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results in video understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VideoLLMs primarily focus on high-level comprehension and lack flexibility in object-centric multiround interactions using both textual and visual prompts.

Method: The proposed method includes development of the VideoLLM model with object referring and grounding capabilities, introduction of the STOM module for propagating visual prompts, and creation of the VideoInfer dataset for object-centric video reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments across 12 benchmarks demonstrate the proposed model's superiority in video question answering and segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The model extends the flexibility and robustness of VideoLLMs, showcasing advancements in multimodal, object-centric video understanding.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
progress in general video understanding. However, existing models primarily
focus on high-level comprehension and are limited to text-only responses,
restricting the flexibility for object-centric, multiround interactions. In
this paper, we make three contributions: (i) we address these limitations by
introducing a VideoLLM model, capable of performing both object referring for
input and grounding for output in video reasoning tasks, i.e., allowing users
to interact with videos using both textual and visual prompts; (ii) we propose
STOM (Spatial-Temporal Overlay Module), a novel approach that propagates
arbitrary visual prompts input at any single timestamp to the remaining frames
within a video; (iii) we present VideoInfer, a manually curated object-centric
video instruction dataset featuring questionanswering pairs that require
reasoning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on VideoInfer and other
existing benchmarks across video question answering and referring object
segmentation. The results on 12 benchmarks of 6 tasks show that our proposed
model consistently outperforms baselines in both video question answering and
segmentation, underscoring its robustness in multimodal, object-centric video
and image understanding. Project page:

*Steven Walton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores architectural innovations to improve computer vision models' efficiency by addressing data flow, modifying neural structures, and leveraging Normalizing Flows for better performance with fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of computer vision model capabilities has led to excessive computational demands, necessitating efficient architectures suitable for resource-limited environments.

Method: The paper tackles the problem through three strategies: optimizing data intake/output, refining attention mechanisms in vision transformers, and using Normalizing Flows to enhance knowledge distillation.

Result: The proposed architectural principles demonstrate potential in reducing computational demands while maintaining or even improving model performance.

Conclusion: Efficient design of neural architectures can make computer vision models smaller, faster, and cheaper without compromising their effectiveness.

Abstract: Major advancements in the capabilities of computer vision models have been
primarily fueled by rapid expansion of datasets, model parameters, and
computational budgets, leading to ever-increasing demands on computational
infrastructure. However, as these models are deployed in increasingly diverse
and resource-constrained environments, there is a pressing need for
architectures that can deliver high performance while requiring fewer
computational resources.
  This dissertation focuses on architectural principles through which models
can achieve increased performance while reducing their computational demands.
We discuss strides towards this goal through three directions. First, we focus
on data ingress and egress, investigating how information may be passed into
and retrieved from our core neural processing units. This ensures that our
models make the most of available data, allowing smaller architectures to
become more performant. Second, we investigate modifications to the core neural
architecture, applied to restricted attention in vision transformers. This
section explores how removing uniform context windows in restricted attention
increases the expressivity of the underlying neural architecture. Third, we
explore the natural structures of Normalizing Flows and how we can leverage
these properties to better distill model knowledge.
  These contributions demonstrate that careful design of neural architectures
can increase the efficiency of machine learning algorithms, allowing them to
become smaller, faster, and cheaper.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Exemplar Med-DETR, a multi-modal contrastive detector for abnormalities in medical images, achieving improved detection performance across various imaging modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection methods struggle with class-specific features and varied imaging modalities, particularly in dense breast tissue mammography which obscures lesions.

Method: Exemplar Med-DETR employs cross-attention with derived class-specific exemplar features and uses an iterative training strategy.

Result: It achieves significant improvements in detection performance across three imaging modalities from four datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art results, including a 16-point improvement in mammography and enhanced performance in chest X-rays and angiography.

Conclusion: The method showcases robust potential in improving generalizable detection systems for diverse medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Detecting abnormalities in medical images poses unique challenges due to
differences in feature representations and the intricate relationship between
anatomical structures and abnormalities. This is especially evident in
mammography, where dense breast tissue can obscure lesions, complicating
radiological interpretation. Despite leveraging anatomical and semantic
context, existing detection methods struggle to learn effective class-specific
features, limiting their applicability across different tasks and imaging
modalities. In this work, we introduce Exemplar Med-DETR, a novel multi-modal
contrastive detector that enables feature-based detection. It employs
cross-attention with inherently derived, intuitive class-specific exemplar
features and is trained with an iterative strategy. We achieve state-of-the-art
performance across three distinct imaging modalities from four public datasets.
On Vietnamese dense breast mammograms, we attain an mAP of 0.7 for mass
detection and 0.55 for calcifications, yielding an absolute improvement of 16
percentage points. Additionally, a radiologist-supported evaluation of 100
mammograms from an out-of-distribution Chinese cohort demonstrates a twofold
gain in lesion detection performance. For chest X-rays and angiography, we
achieve an mAP of 0.25 for mass and 0.37 for stenosis detection, improving
results by 4 and 7 percentage points, respectively. These results highlight the
potential of our approach to advance robust and generalizable detection systems
for medical imaging.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Medical Imaging Segmentation Toolkit (MIST) with new postprocessing features tailored for the BraTS 2025 glioma segmentation challenge, demonstrating its effectiveness and open-source flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical image segmentation lacks standardized and customizable tools for method comparison and refinement.

Method: The authors present MIST, focusing on a modular postprocessing framework that supports flexible transforms (e.g., object removal, morphological operations). They evaluate user-defined strategies for segmentation refinement on BraTS challenge data.

Result: MIST's postprocessing strategies improve segmentation quality and rank well under BraTS competition standards.

Conclusion: MIST demonstrates its utility in facilitating rapid, reproducible, and high-quality medical image segmentation research as an open-source, extensible toolkit.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation continues to advance rapidly, yet rigorous
comparison between methods remains challenging due to a lack of standardized
and customizable tooling. In this work, we present the current state of the
Medical Imaging Segmentation Toolkit (MIST), with a particular focus on its
flexible and modular postprocessing framework designed for the BraTS 2025 pre-
and post-treatment glioma segmentation challenge. Since its debut in the 2024
BraTS adult glioma post-treatment segmentation challenge, MIST's postprocessing
module has been significantly extended to support a wide range of transforms,
including removal or replacement of small objects, extraction of the largest
connected components, and morphological operations such as hole filling and
closing. These transforms can be composed into user-defined strategies,
enabling fine-grained control over the final segmentation output. We evaluate
three such strategies - ranging from simple small-object removal to more
complex, class-specific pipelines - and rank their performance using the BraTS
ranking protocol. Our results highlight how MIST facilitates rapid
experimentation and targeted refinement, ultimately producing high-quality
segmentations for the BraTS 2025 challenge. MIST remains open source and
extensible, supporting reproducible and scalable research in medical image
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SynPAIN, a synthetic dataset for pain detection, addressing limitations in diversity and age representation in existing datasets, and demonstrating its efficacy in detecting bias and improving clinical outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the challenge of accurately assessing pain in non-communicative individuals, such as older adults with dementia, and the limitations of current pain detection datasets in terms of diversity, privacy, and age representation.

Method: The authors created the SynPAIN dataset using generative AI tools to produce 10,710 synthetic facial images with pain expressions, balanced across ethnicities, age groups, and genders. They validated pain patterns using facial action unit analysis and tested the dataset's impact on algorithmic bias and model performance.

Result: SynPAIN revealed significant algorithmic bias across demographic groups in existing pain detection models. It also improved pain detection performance on real clinical data by 7.0% when used for age-matched synthetic data augmentation.

Conclusion: SynPAIN fills critical gaps in pain assessment research, providing a publicly available demographically diverse dataset designed for older adults and a framework for addressing algorithmic bias in pain detection models.

Abstract: Accurate pain assessment in patients with limited ability to communicate,
such as older adults with dementia, represents a critical healthcare challenge.
Robust automated systems of pain detection may facilitate such assessments.
Existing pain detection datasets, however, suffer from limited ethnic/racial
diversity, privacy constraints, and underrepresentation of older adults who are
the primary target population for clinical deployment. We present SynPAIN, a
large-scale synthetic dataset containing 10,710 facial expression images (5,355
neutral/expressive pairs) across five ethnicities/races, two age groups (young:
20-35, old: 75+), and two genders. Using commercial generative AI tools, we
created demographically balanced synthetic identities with clinically
meaningful pain expressions. Our validation demonstrates that synthetic pain
expressions exhibit expected pain patterns, scoring significantly higher than
neutral and non-pain expressions using clinically validated pain assessment
tools based on facial action unit analysis. We experimentally demonstrate
SynPAIN's utility in identifying algorithmic bias in existing pain detection
models. Through comprehensive bias evaluation, we reveal substantial
performance disparities across demographic characteristics. These performance
disparities were previously undetectable with smaller, less diverse datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that age-matched synthetic data augmentation
improves pain detection performance on real clinical data, achieving a 7.0%
improvement in average precision. SynPAIN addresses critical gaps in pain
assessment research by providing the first publicly available, demographically
diverse synthetic dataset specifically designed for older adult pain detection,
while establishing a framework for measuring and mitigating algorithmic bias.

*Mandar Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semi-supervised strategy for fine-tuning compact Vision Language Models (VLMs) in e-commerce using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and unlabeled product listing data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning VLMs for image-based product attribute prediction is challenging due to the high cost of manual annotation or API-based labeling processes.

Method: The paper uses PEFT to train low-rank adapter modules initially. Adapter weights are updated using DPO loss, based on reasoning-and-answer chains generated from unlabeled samples, which are categorized into preferred and dispreferred responses.

Result: DPO-based fine-tuning achieves improved performance over supervised models on a multi-vertical e-commerce dataset, using only unlabeled data.

Conclusion: Utilizing a large pool of unlabeled data in combination with DPO fine-tuning leads to accurate and efficient convergence with minimal computational costs, addressing label inefficiency in e-commerce attribute prediction tasks.

Abstract: Image-based product attribute prediction in e-commerce is a crucial task with
numerous applications. The supervised fine-tuning of Vision Language Models
(VLMs) faces significant scale challenges due to the cost of manual or API
based annotation. In this paper, we investigate label-efficient semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategies for compact VLMs (2B-3B parameters) that leverage
unlabeled product listings through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
Beginning with a small, API-based, annotated, and labeled set, we first employ
PEFT to train low-rank adapter modules. To update the adapter weights with
unlabeled data, we generate multiple reasoning-and-answer chains per unlabeled
sample and segregate these chains into preferred and dispreferred based on
self-consistency. We then fine-tune the model with DPO loss and use the updated
model for the next iteration. By using PEFT fine-tuning with DPO, our method
achieves efficient convergence with minimal compute overhead. On a dataset
spanning twelve e-commerce verticals, DPO-based fine-tuning, which utilizes
only unlabeled data, demonstrates a significant improvement over the supervised
model. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that accuracy with DPO training
improves with more unlabeled data, indicating that a large pool of unlabeled
samples can be effectively leveraged to improve performance.

Result: DeepJIVE effectively identified joint and individual variations within diverse datasets, including synthetic and real-world 1D, 2D, 3D data. It also uncovered biologically plausible patterns in Alzheimer's PET and MR data.

Conclusion: DeepJIVE is a promising tool for analyzing multimodal data, offering improvements over traditional techniques.

Abstract: Conventional multimodal data integration methods provide a comprehensive
assessment of the shared or unique structure within each individual data type
but suffer from several limitations such as the inability to handle
high-dimensional data and identify nonlinear structures. In this paper, we
introduce DeepJIVE, a deep-learning approach to performing Joint and Individual
Variance Explained (JIVE). We perform mathematical derivation and experimental
validations using both synthetic and real-world 1D, 2D, and 3D datasets.
Different strategies of achieving the identity and orthogonality constraints
for DeepJIVE were explored, resulting in three viable loss functions. We found
that DeepJIVE can successfully uncover joint and individual variations of
multimodal datasets. Our application of DeepJIVE to the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) also identified biologically plausible
covariation patterns between the amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and
magnetic resonance (MR) images. In conclusion, the proposed DeepJIVE can be a
useful tool for multimodal data analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safe and efficient autonomous navigation in complex urban environments by improving perception and scene understanding.

Method: Utilizing a hierarchical architecture with a point cloud encoder, a window-based backbone, and a query-based decoder head to extract spatial features and object relationships.

Result: The framework provides interpretable and diverse instance predictions for enhanced decision-making in autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: Co-Win advances autonomous systems by offering a more precise and fine-grained perception methodology with improved contextual and data consistency.

Abstract: Accurate perception and scene understanding in complex urban environments is
a critical challenge for ensuring safe and efficient autonomous navigation. In
this paper, we present Co-Win, a novel bird's eye view (BEV) perception
framework that integrates point cloud encoding with efficient parallel
window-based feature extraction to address the multi-modality inherent in
environmental understanding. Our method employs a hierarchical architecture
comprising a specialized encoder, a window-based backbone, and a query-based
decoder head to effectively capture diverse spatial features and object
relationships. Unlike prior approaches that treat perception as a simple
regression task, our framework incorporates a variational approach with
mask-based instance segmentation, enabling fine-grained scene decomposition and
understanding. The Co-Win architecture processes point cloud data through
progressive feature extraction stages, ensuring that predicted masks are both
data-consistent and contextually relevant. Furthermore, our method produces
interpretable and diverse instance predictions, enabling enhanced downstream
decision-making and planning in autonomous driving systems.

*Asmae Lamsaf,Lucia Cascone,Hugo Proença,João Neves*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an evaluation framework to analyze biases in synthetic face detectors concerning various facial attributes, highlighting significant social and ethical implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the overlooked issue of bias in synthetic face detectors and training datasets, which has implications for detection reliability across demographic groups.

Method: The framework involves the use of synthetic data with evenly distributed attribute labels to reduce skew and analyze bias levels in five detectors using controlled facial attributes.

Result: The study reveals biases in synthetic face detectors linked to specific facial attributes, origin insights, and how biases relate to attribute balancing in training sets.

Conclusion: Synthetic face detectors are inherently biased, but the bias origins can be traced to the training set attributes and detector activation responses, emphasizing the need for balanced datasets.

Abstract: Bias analysis for synthetic face detection is bound to become a critical
topic in the coming years. Although many detection models have been developed
and several datasets have been released to reliably identify synthetic content,
one crucial aspect has been largely overlooked: these models and training
datasets can be biased, leading to failures in detection for certain
demographic groups and raising significant social, legal, and ethical issues.
In this work, we introduce an evaluation framework to contribute to the
analysis of bias of synthetic face detectors with respect to several facial
attributes. This framework exploits synthetic data generation, with evenly
distributed attribute labels, for mitigating any skew in the data that could
otherwise influence the outcomes of bias analysis. We build on the proposed
framework to provide an extensive case study of the bias level of five
state-of-the-art detectors in synthetic datasets with 25 controlled facial
attributes. While the results confirm that, in general, synthetic face
detectors are biased towards the presence/absence of specific facial
attributes, our study also sheds light on the origins of the observed bias
through the analysis of the correlations with the balancing of facial
attributes in the training sets of the detectors, and the analysis of detectors
activation maps in image pairs with controlled attribute modifications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the uQRPCA and uQRPCA+ frameworks for improved moving target detection and background recovery in color videos, leveraging quaternion-based techniques for better computational efficiency and segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently detecting moving targets and recovering backgrounds in diverse in-the-wild color videos captured by static cameras, as well as improving annotated dataset generation and deep model generalization.

Method: The paper proposes reducing the computational complexity of Quaternion Singular Value Decomposition (QSVD) using a quaternion Riemannian manifold and introduces the uQRPCA framework. It further extends this to uQRPCA+ by integrating the Color Rank-1 Batch (CR1B) method.

Result: The proposed uQRPCA+ framework demonstrates State Of The Art (SOTA) performance in segmentation accuracy and background recovery compared to existing methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The uQRPCA+ framework advances moving target detection and background recovery while optimizing computational efficiency, providing superior performance and enriching color video processing techniques.

Abstract: Moving target detection is a challenging computer vision task aimed at
generating accurate segmentation maps in diverse in-the-wild color videos
captured by static cameras. If backgrounds and targets can be simultaneously
extracted and recombined, such synthetic data can significantly enrich
annotated in-the-wild datasets and enhance the generalization ability of deep
models. Quaternion-based RPCA (QRPCA) is a promising unsupervised paradigm for
color image processing. However, in color video processing, Quaternion Singular
Value Decomposition (QSVD) incurs high computational costs, and rank-1
quaternion matrix fails to yield rank-1 color channels. In this paper, we
reduce the computational complexity of QSVD to o(1) by utilizing a quaternion
Riemannian manifold. Furthermor, we propose the universal QRPCA (uQRPCA)
framework, which achieves a balance in simultaneously segmenting targets and
recovering backgrounds from color videos. Moreover, we expand to uQRPCA+ by
introducing the Color Rank-1 Batch (CR1B) method to further process and obtain
the ideal low-rank background across color channels. Experiments demonstrate
our uQRPCA+ achieves State Of The Art (SOTA) performance on moving target
detection and background recovery tasks compared to existing open-source
methods. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores enhancing stereo matching accuracy in RAFT-Stereo using sparse LiDAR guidance, introducing pre-filling strategies to address challenges with sparse data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of leveraging sparse LiDAR data to improve stereo matching accuracy, which traditionally suffers as LiDAR points become sparse.

Method: The authors utilize pre-filling strategies to augment sparse initial disparity maps and tailor approaches for both early and late fusion mechanisms.

Result: The introduced Guided RAFT-Stereo (GRAFT-Stereo) significantly outperforms existing methods under sparse LiDAR conditions across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Pre-filling sparse data and combining strategies enhances performance, offering a simple yet effective solution to stereo matching challenges under sparse LiDAR inputs.

Abstract: We investigate LiDAR guidance within the RAFT-Stereo framework, aiming to
improve stereo matching accuracy by injecting precise LiDAR depth into the
initial disparity map. We find that the effectiveness of LiDAR guidance
drastically degrades when the LiDAR points become sparse (e.g., a few hundred
points per frame), and we offer a novel explanation from a signal processing
perspective. This insight leads to a surprisingly simple solution that enables
LiDAR-guided RAFT-Stereo to thrive: pre-filling the sparse initial disparity
map with interpolation. Interestingly, we find that pre-filling is also
effective when injecting LiDAR depth into image features via early fusion, but
for a fundamentally different reason, necessitating a distinct pre-filling
approach. By combining both solutions, the proposed Guided RAFT-Stereo
(GRAFT-Stereo) significantly outperforms existing LiDAR-guided methods under
sparse LiDAR conditions across various datasets. We hope this study inspires
more effective LiDAR-guided stereo methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to improve long-term instance tracking and identity management in temporally consistent video instance segmentation processes, especially for datasets with challenging long videos.

Method: The authors propose Latest Object Memory (LOM) to track and update object states by modeling their presence in each frame, and Decoupled Object Association (DOA) to separately manage new and existing objects for better tracking.

Result: LOMM achieves an AP score of 54.0 on YouTube-VIS 2022, outperforming traditional methods and demonstrating superior tracking accuracy, reliability, and identity consistency.

Conclusion: LOMM sets a new benchmark in video instance segmentation, showing its effectiveness in improving the VIS process by addressing both accuracy and stability in tracking.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Latest Object Memory Management (LOMM) for
temporally consistent video instance segmentation that significantly improves
long-term instance tracking. At the core of our method is Latest Object Memory
(LOM), which robustly tracks and continuously updates the latest states of
objects by explicitly modeling their presence in each frame. This enables
consistent tracking and accurate identity management across frames, enhancing
both performance and reliability through the VIS process. Moreover, we
introduce Decoupled Object Association (DOA), a strategy that separately
handles newly appearing and already existing objects. By leveraging our memory
system, DOA accurately assigns object indices, improving matching accuracy and
ensuring stable identity consistency, even in dynamic scenes where objects
frequently appear and disappear. Extensive experiments and ablation studies
demonstrate the superiority of our method over traditional approaches, setting
a new benchmark in VIS. Notably, our LOMM achieves state-of-the-art AP score of
54.0 on YouTube-VIS 2022, a dataset known for its challenging long videos.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel task, Face Retouching Restoration (FRR), aiming to recover original faces from retouched images using a specialized framework called MoFRR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The use of face retouching on social media challenges the authenticity of images, creating a need for techniques to not just detect but also restore original faces.

Method: The proposed method, MoFRR, uses a mixture of diffusion models with specialized and shared experts. It integrates a dual-branch structure for handling low-frequency and high-frequency aspects of face retouching.

Result: MoFRR achieves effective restoration performance based on extensive experiments conducted on a newly created RetouchingFFHQ++ dataset.

Conclusion: The study establishes FRR as a novel task and introduces MoFRR as a promising approach with specialized mechanisms to address varied retouching complexities.

Abstract: The widespread use of face retouching on social media platforms raises
concerns about the authenticity of face images. While existing methods focus on
detecting face retouching, how to accurately recover the original faces from
the retouched ones has yet to be answered. This paper introduces Face
Retouching Restoration (FRR), a novel computer vision task aimed at restoring
original faces from their retouched counterparts. FRR differs from traditional
image restoration tasks by addressing the complex retouching operations with
various types and degrees, which focuses more on the restoration of the
low-frequency information of the faces. To tackle this challenge, we propose
MoFRR, Mixture of Diffusion Models for FRR. Inspired by DeepSeek's expert
isolation strategy, the MoFRR uses sparse activation of specialized experts
handling distinct retouching types and the engagement of a shared expert
dealing with universal retouching traces. Each specialized expert follows a
dual-branch structure with a DDIM-based low-frequency branch guided by an
Iterative Distortion Evaluation Module (IDEM) and a Cross-Attention-based
High-Frequency branch (HFCAM) for detail refinement. Extensive experiments on a
newly constructed face retouching dataset, RetouchingFFHQ++, demonstrate the
effectiveness of MoFRR for FRR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines what Masked Autoencoder (MAE) learns and proposes a self-guided MAE that uses its own progress in patch clustering to improve learning, verified across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover what and how MAE learns during its pretraining process, and to explore improvements in its learning using internal insights.

Method: The self-guided MAE internally generates an informed masking pattern based on its patch-clustering progress, replacing random masking used in the standard MAE.

Result: The self-guided MAE achieves a more effective and efficient learning process, showing improvements across different downstream tasks without sacrificing the self-supervised learning property.

Conclusion: The proposed self-guided MAE enhances the understanding of MAE's learning process while significantly improving its efficiency and effectiveness in self-supervised representation learning.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) is a self-supervised approach for representation
learning, widely applicable to a variety of downstream tasks in computer
vision. In spite of its success, it is still not fully uncovered what and how
MAE exactly learns. In this paper, with an in-depth analysis, we discover that
MAE intrinsically learns pattern-based patch-level clustering from surprisingly
early stages of pretraining. Upon this understanding, we propose self-guided
masked autoencoder, which internally generates informed mask by utilizing its
progress in patch clustering, substituting the naive random masking of the
vanilla MAE. Our approach significantly boosts its learning process without
relying on any external models or supplementary information, keeping the
benefit of self-supervised nature of MAE intact. Comprehensive experiments on

### [157] [HydraMamba: Multi-Head State Space Model for Global Point Cloud Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19778)
*Kanglin Qu,Pan Gao,Qun Dai,Yuanhao Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HydraMamba, a state space model-based network for point cloud learning, addressing long-range dependency and locality learning issues with methods like shuffle serialization, ConvBiS6 layer, and MHS6.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention mechanisms in point cloud learning show limited long-range dependency modeling due to quadratic complexity. Existing techniques using state space models like Mamba show promise but struggle with serialization and locality learning.

Method: The authors propose HydraMamba, introducing a shuffle serialization strategy for better point cloud adaptation, ConvBiS6 layer for local and global feature learning, and multi-head S6 (MHS6) for enhanced modeling capability.

Result: HydraMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in both object-level and scene-level tasks in point cloud learning.

Conclusion: HydraMamba effectively addresses long-range and local dependency modeling challenges in point cloud networks, presenting innovative methods to advance the field.

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a dominant operator in point cloud
learning, but its quadratic complexity leads to limited inter-point
interactions, hindering long-range dependency modeling between objects. Due to
excellent long-range modeling capability with linear complexity, the selective
state space model (S6), as the core of Mamba, has been exploited in point cloud
learning for long-range dependency interactions over the entire point cloud.
Despite some significant progress, related works still suffer from imperfect
point cloud serialization and lack of locality learning. To this end, we
explore a state space model-based point cloud network termed HydraMamba to
address the above challenges. Specifically, we design a shuffle serialization
strategy, making unordered point sets better adapted to the causal nature of
S6. Meanwhile, to overcome the deficiency of existing techniques in locality
learning, we propose a ConvBiS6 layer, which is capable of capturing local
geometries and global context dependencies synergistically. Besides, we propose
MHS6 by extending the multi-head design to S6, further enhancing its modeling
capability. HydraMamba achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks at
both object-level and scene-level. The code is available at

*Zhiming Liu,Paul Hill,Nantheera Anantrasirichai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JDATT is proposed as a lightweight solution to mitigate atmospheric turbulence effects and enhance target detection using knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in turbulent image mitigation and detection system setups that are computationally intensive and inefficient.

Method: Integrates turbulence mitigation and detection through a unified knowledge distillation strategy combining hybrid schemes: CWD, MGD, and output-level via Kullback-Leibler divergence.

Result: Demonstrates improved visual restoration, detection accuracy, reduced model size, and faster inference on real and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: JDATT is effective for high visual quality and detection in real-time environments, particularly resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence (AT) introduces severe degradations, such as rippling,
blur, and intensity fluctuations, that hinder both image quality and downstream
vision tasks like target detection. While recent deep learning-based approaches
have advanced AT mitigation using transformer and Mamba architectures, their
high complexity and computational cost make them unsuitable for real-time
applications, especially in resource-constrained settings such as remote
surveillance. Moreover, the common practice of separating turbulence mitigation
and object detection leads to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, we propose JDATT, a Joint Distillation framework for
Atmospheric Turbulence mitigation and Target detection. JDATT integrates
state-of-the-art AT mitigation and detection modules and introduces a unified
knowledge distillation strategy that compresses both components while
minimizing performance loss. We employ a hybrid distillation scheme:
feature-level distillation via Channel-Wise Distillation (CWD) and Masked
Generative Distillation (MGD), and output-level distillation via
Kullback-Leibler divergence. Experiments on synthetic and real-world turbulence
datasets demonstrate that JDATT achieves superior visual restoration and
detection accuracy while significantly reducing model size and inference time,
making it well-suited for real-time deployment.

*Suhwan Cho,Minhyeok Lee,Jungho Lee,Sunghun Yang,Sangyoun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TransFlow, a method using video diffusion models to generate realistic optical flows for video salient object detection (SOD), addressing the issues with training data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training video SOD models is hindered by the limited availability of video datasets compared to image datasets, particularly for motion-guided tasks.

Method: TransFlow utilizes pre-trained video diffusion models to create realistic optical flows from static images. These flows preserve semantic motion patterns, spatial boundaries, and temporal coherence.

Result: Improved performance in video SOD was achieved across multiple benchmarks, showcasing effective motion knowledge transfer using TransFlow.

Conclusion: TransFlow effectively leverages video diffusion models for motion knowledge transfer, generating realistic training data that enhances video SOD models.

Abstract: Video salient object detection (SOD) relies on motion cues to distinguish
salient objects from backgrounds, but training such models is limited by scarce
video datasets compared to abundant image datasets. Existing approaches that
use spatial transformations to create video sequences from static images fail
for motion-guided tasks, as these transformations produce unrealistic optical
flows that lack semantic understanding of motion. We present TransFlow, which
transfers motion knowledge from pre-trained video diffusion models to generate
realistic training data for video SOD. Video diffusion models have learned rich
semantic motion priors from large-scale video data, understanding how different
objects naturally move in real scenes. TransFlow leverages this knowledge to
generate semantically-aware optical flows from static images, where objects
exhibit natural motion patterns while preserving spatial boundaries and
temporal coherence. Our method achieves improved performance across multiple
benchmarks, demonstrating effective motion knowledge transfer.

### [160] [DepthFlow: Exploiting Depth-Flow Structural Correlations for Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19790)
*Suhwan Cho,Minhyeok Lee,Jungho Lee,Donghyeong Kim,Sangyoun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthFlow proposes a novel method to synthesize optical flow using depth information from single images, enabling large-scale data generation and improving unsupervised video object segmentation (VOS) performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of limited training data in unsupervised video object segmentation, a major bottleneck for models leveraging both RGB and optical flow inputs.

Method: DepthFlow estimates depth maps from images and converts them into synthetic optical flow fields, preserving structural cues. This expands image-mask pairs into image-flow-mask pairs for training.

Result: Using DepthFlow's synthesized data, a simple encoder-decoder achieved state-of-the-art performance across all public VOS benchmarks.

Conclusion: DepthFlow offers a scalable data generation solution that dramatically improves VOS by leveraging depth structures in synthetic optical flow.

Abstract: Unsupervised video object segmentation (VOS) aims to detect the most
prominent object in a video. Recently, two-stream approaches that leverage both
RGB images and optical flow have gained significant attention, but their
performance is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of training data. To
address this, we propose DepthFlow, a novel data generation method that
synthesizes optical flow from single images. Our approach is driven by the key
insight that VOS models depend more on structural information embedded in flow
maps than on their geometric accuracy, and that this structure is highly
correlated with depth. We first estimate a depth map from a source image and
then convert it into a synthetic flow field that preserves essential structural
cues. This process enables the transformation of large-scale image-mask pairs
into image-flow-mask training pairs, dramatically expanding the data available
for network training. By training a simple encoder-decoder architecture with
our synthesized data, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on all public
VOS benchmarks, demonstrating a scalable and effective solution to the data
scarcity problem.

### [161] [ForCenNet: Foreground-Centric Network for Document Image Rectification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19804)
*Peng Cai,Qiang Li,Kaicheng Yang,Dong Guo,Jia Li,Nan Zhou,Xiang An,Ninghua Yang,Jiankang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Foreground-Centric Network (ForCenNet) to address geometric distortions in document images by emphasizing foreground elements, achieving improved performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for document image rectification lack attention to foreground elements, which are crucial for improving geometric correction and preserving layout structure.

Method: The paper introduces ForCenNet, consisting of a foreground-centric label generation method, a mask mechanism to highlight readable regions, and a curvature consistency loss to understand distorted geometry using detailed foreground labels.

Result: ForCenNet demonstrates superior performance on four benchmarks (DocUNet, DIR300, WarpDoc, and DocReal) and effectively corrects distortions in layout elements like text lines and table borders.

Conclusion: Foreground emphasis is critical in document rectification tasks, and ForCenNet sets new standards by achieving state-of-the-art results on geometric correction benchmarks.

Abstract: Document image rectification aims to eliminate geometric deformation in
photographed documents to facilitate text recognition. However, existing
methods often neglect the significance of foreground elements, which provide
essential geometric references and layout information for document image
correction. In this paper, we introduce Foreground-Centric Network (ForCenNet)
to eliminate geometric distortions in document images. Specifically, we
initially propose a foreground-centric label generation method, which extracts
detailed foreground elements from an undistorted image. Then we introduce a
foreground-centric mask mechanism to enhance the distinction between readable
and background regions. Furthermore, we design a curvature consistency loss to
leverage the detailed foreground labels to help the model understand the
distorted geometric distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ForCenNet achieves new state-of-the-art on four real-world benchmarks, such as
DocUNet, DIR300, WarpDoc, and DocReal. Quantitative analysis shows that the
proposed method effectively undistorts layout elements, such as text lines and
table borders. The resources for further comparison are provided at

### [162] [DS-Det: Single-Query Paradigm and Attention Disentangled Learning for Flexible Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19807)
*Guiping Cao,Xiangyuan Lan,Wenjian Huang,Jianguo Zhang,Dongmei Jiang,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DS-Det, an efficient and flexible transformer detector overcoming limitations like fixed-query modeling and inefficiencies in decoder operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore and overcome limitations in existing fixed-query mechanisms and inefficiencies caused by interaction issues (ROT) and query ambiguity in transformer detectors.

Method: Introduces the DS-Det with a unified Single-Query paradigm and attention disentangled learning. Proposes PoCoo loss to prioritize hard sample learning.

Result: Experiments show DS-Det's superior performance across five backbone models on COCO2017 and WiderPerson datasets.

Conclusion: DS-Det enhances decoder efficiency, flexibility, and accuracy in object detection tasks, demonstrating robust and generalized improvement.

Abstract: Popular transformer detectors have achieved promising performance through
query-based learning using attention mechanisms. However, the roles of existing
decoder query types (e.g., content query and positional query) are still
underexplored. These queries are generally predefined with a fixed number
(fixed-query), which limits their flexibility. We find that the learning of
these fixed-query is impaired by Recurrent Opposing inTeractions (ROT) between
two attention operations: Self-Attention (query-to-query) and Cross-Attention
(query-to-encoder), thereby degrading decoder efficiency. Furthermore, "query
ambiguity" arises when shared-weight decoder layers are processed with both
one-to-one and one-to-many label assignments during training, violating DETR's
one-to-one matching principle. To address these challenges, we propose DS-Det,
a more efficient detector capable of detecting a flexible number of objects in
images. Specifically, we reformulate and introduce a new unified Single-Query
paradigm for decoder modeling, transforming the fixed-query into flexible.
Furthermore, we propose a simplified decoder framework through attention
disentangled learning: locating boxes with Cross-Attention (one-to-many
process), deduplicating predictions with Self-Attention (one-to-one process),
addressing "query ambiguity" and "ROT" issues directly, and enhancing decoder
efficiency. We further introduce a unified PoCoo loss that leverages box size
priors to prioritize query learning on hard samples such as small objects.
Extensive experiments across five different backbone models on COCO2017 and
WiderPerson datasets demonstrate the general effectiveness and superiority of
DS-Det. The source codes are available at

*Joon Hyun Park,Kumju Jo,Sungyong Baik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeeDiff leverages attention mechanisms in Stable Diffusion to autonomously generate high-quality pixel-level annotation masks without requiring additional training or pre-trained segmentation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation networks require labor-intensive pixel-level annotation masks, while existing approaches using Diffusion models rely on additional training or prompt tuning.

Method: SeeDiff uses cross-attention mechanisms for coarse object localization and multi-scale self-attention for iterative region expansion, complemented by background mask refinement.

Result: The method achieves high-quality object annotation masks directly from Stable Diffusion without the need for pre-trained networks or tuning.

Conclusion: SeeDiff simplifies the annotation mask generation process by fully utilizing Stable Diffusion's capabilities, removing the need for manual or additional computational steps.

Abstract: Entrusted with the goal of pixel-level object classification, the semantic
segmentation networks entail the laborious preparation of pixel-level
annotation masks. To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class
without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of
images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled
by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these
works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and
thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or
the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In
this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion,
from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches.
In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object
localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region
expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the
semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively
spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale
self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image
often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences,
compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a
more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates
high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional
training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network.

### [164] [FM-LC: A Hierarchical Framework for Urban Flood Mapping by Land Cover Identification Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19818)
*Xin Hong,Longchao Da,Hua Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents FM-LC, a hierarchical flood-mapping framework that uses high-resolution PlanetScope satellite imagery to improve flood mapping in arid urban areas, addressing challenges like limited spectral contrast.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban flooding in arid regions brings significant risks to infrastructure and communities, yet accurate flood extents and recovery mapping remain challenging due to spectral, dynamic, and land-cover complexities.

Method: The FM-LC framework employs a three-stage process: (1) initial segmentation via a multi-class U-Net, (2) misclassification correction with a binary expert model, and (3) boundary refinement using Bayesian smoothing.

Result: The framework achieved an average F1-score improvement of up to 29% across land-cover classes and demonstrated superior flood delineations compared to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: FM-LC significantly enhances urban flood mapping accuracy in arid environments, offering improved tools for emergency response and resilience planning.

Abstract: Urban flooding in arid regions poses severe risks to infrastructure and
communities. Accurate, fine-scale mapping of flood extents and recovery
trajectories is therefore essential for improving emergency response and
resilience planning. However, arid environments often exhibit limited spectral
contrast between water and adjacent surfaces, rapid hydrological dynamics, and
highly heterogeneous urban land covers, which challenge traditional
flood-mapping approaches. High-resolution, daily PlanetScope imagery provides
the temporal and spatial detail needed. In this work, we introduce FM-LC, a
hierarchical framework for Flood Mapping by Land Cover identification, for this
challenging task. Through a three-stage process, it first uses an initial
multi-class U-Net to segment imagery into water, vegetation, built area, and
bare ground classes. We identify that this method has confusion between
spectrally similar categories (e.g., water vs. vegetation). Second, by early
checking, the class with the major misclassified area is flagged, and a
lightweight binary expert segmentation model is trained to distinguish the
flagged class from the rest. Third, a Bayesian smoothing step refines
boundaries and removes spurious noise by leveraging nearby pixel information.
We validate the framework on the April 2024 Dubai storm event, using pre- and
post-rainfall PlanetScope composites. Experimental results demonstrate average
F1-score improvements of up to 29% across all land-cover classes and notably
sharper flood delineations, significantly outperforming conventional
single-stage U-Net baselines.

*Yanrui Yu,Tianfei Zhou,Jiaxin Sun,Lianpeng Qiao,Lizhong Ding,Ye Yuan,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents LAVA, a system for natural language-based, scalable querying of large-scale video data, demonstrating significant performance improvements compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and rigidity of SQL-based querying methods for large-scale video analytic tasks, which limit analytical flexibility in processing massive video data.

Method: The paper proposes LAVA, which includes (1) a multi-armed bandit approach for efficient video sampling, (2) open-world object detection for object retrieval, and (3) a scheme for long-term object trajectory extraction for temporal analytics.

Result: Experiments show that LAVA achieves a 14% improvement in F1-score, a 0.39 reduction in MPAE for aggregation tasks, 86% top-k precision, and is 9.6x faster in processing compared to baselines.

Conclusion: LAVA provides an effective and flexible solution for large-scale video querying using natural language, offering significant analytical advancements in urban surveillance and traffic monitoring applications.

Abstract: In modern urban environments, camera networks generate massive amounts of
operational footage -- reaching petabytes each day -- making scalable video
analytics essential for efficient processing. Many existing approaches adopt an
SQL-based paradigm for querying such large-scale video databases; however, this
constrains queries to rigid patterns with predefined semantic categories,
significantly limiting analytical flexibility. In this work, we explore a
language-driven video analytics paradigm aimed at enabling flexible and
efficient querying of high-volume video data driven by natural language.
Particularly, we build \textsc{Lava}, a system that accepts natural language
queries and retrieves traffic targets across multiple levels of granularity and
arbitrary categories. \textsc{Lava} comprises three main components: 1) a
multi-armed bandit-based efficient sampling method for video segment-level
localization;
  2) a video-specific open-world detection module for object-level retrieval;
and 3) a long-term object trajectory extraction scheme for temporal object
association, yielding complete trajectories for object-of-interests. To support
comprehensive evaluation, we further develop a novel benchmark by providing
diverse, semantically rich natural language predicates and fine-grained
annotations for multiple videos. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that
\textsc{Lava} improves $F_1$-scores for selection queries by $\mathbf{14\%}$,
reduces MPAE for aggregation queries by $\mathbf{0.39}$, and achieves top-$k$
precision of $\mathbf{86\%}$, while processing videos $ \mathbf{9.6\times} $
faster than the most accurate baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an automated, fast, and accurate assessment system for analyzing blast effects in real-world conditions.

Method: Fine-tuning the YOLO12l-seg model for real-time segmentation of blast image data and deriving spatial descriptors from 3D coordinates of segmented objects.

Result: Achieved high segmentation accuracy (Box mAP@0.5 ~ 0.769, Mask mAP@0.5 ~ 0.800 at ~15 FPS) and demonstrated framework reliability with multiple fragmentation cases.

Conclusion: The framework provides accurate, automated analysis of blast effects in field conditions and is robust to challenges such as small-object crowding.

Abstract: We introduce an end-to-end pipeline that leverages a fine-tuned YOLO12l-seg
model -- trained on over 500 annotated post-blast images -- to deliver
real-time instance segmentation (Box mAP@0.5 ~ 0.769, Mask mAP@0.5 ~ 0.800 at ~
15 FPS). High-fidelity masks are converted into normalized 3D coordinates, from
which we extract multi-metric spatial descriptors: principal component
directions, kernel density hotspots, size-depth regression, and Delaunay edge
statistics. We present four representative examples to illustrate key
fragmentation patterns. Experimental results confirm the framework's accuracy,
robustness to small-object crowding, and feasibility for rapid, automated
blast-effect assessment in field conditions.

*Samuel Ebimobowei Johnny,Blessed Guda,Andrew Blayama Stephen,Assane Gueye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoSign is a transformer-based model that directly translates sign language gestures into text, bypassing traditional alignment-based methods, and achieving better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the communication gap between hearing and hearing-impaired communities by improving Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR), addressing the limitations of existing alignment-based CSLR approaches such as error propagation and vocabulary scalability issues.

Method: The authors propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only transformer model, incorporating a 1D CNN-based temporal compression module for pose sequences and using AraGPT2 as a pretrained decoder to generate glosses, bypassing alignment-based mechanisms like CTC or HMM.

Result: AutoSign demonstrated substantial improvements on the Isharah-1000 dataset, offering up to a 6.1% improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: By directly mapping pose sequences to text and eliminating multi-stage pipelines, AutoSign successfully addresses key limitations of traditional CSLR methods and provides a more scalable and accurate solution for signer-independent CSLR.

Abstract: Continuously recognizing sign gestures and converting them to glosses plays a
key role in bridging the gap between the hearing and hearing-impaired
communities. This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and
body gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a
combination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)
methods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then
align variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based
approaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error
propagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary
scalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck. To address
these limitations, we propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only
transformer that directly translates pose sequences to natural language text,
bypassing traditional alignment mechanisms entirely. The use of this
decoder-only approach allows the model to directly map between the features and
the glosses without the need for CTC loss while also directly learning the
textual dependencies in the glosses. Our approach incorporates a temporal
compression module using 1D CNNs to efficiently process pose sequences,
followed by AraGPT2, a pre-trained Arabic decoder, to generate text (glosses).
Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that hand and body
gestures provide the most discriminative features for signer-independent CSLR.
By eliminating the multi-stage pipeline, AutoSign achieves substantial
improvements on the Isharah-1000 dataset, achieving an improvement of up to
6.1\% in WER score compared to the best existing method.

*Wenjie Zhu,Yabin Zhang,Xin Jin,Wenjun Zeng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Knowledge Regularized Negative Feature Tuning (KR-NFT), a novel method designed to enhance out-of-distribution (OOD) detection while maintaining generalization performance for unseen classes and styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of reduced generalization performance of vision-language models with negative prompt tuning for OOD detection.

Method: The authors propose KR-NFT composed of a Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) architecture that separates positive and negative features, and a knowledge-regularization (KR) strategy to avoid forgetting pre-trained knowledge and improve OOD identification.

Result: KR-NFT shows better OOD detection performance, increased in-distribution (ID) classification accuracy, and reduced FPR95 by 5.44% in generalization settings involving unseen ID categories.

Conclusion: KR-NFT improves OOD detection efficiency, scalability, and generalization while preserving ID performance, demonstrating its effectiveness for practical machine learning applications.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for building reliable machine
learning models. Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection
capabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from
reduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative
Feature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture
termed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding
knowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies
distribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively
separating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation
maximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images.
Additionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a
lightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and
mitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional
negative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability.
To optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is
designed to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating
pre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on
trained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID
datasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset,
KR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also
significantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\% under an unexplored generalization
setting with unseen ID categories. Codes can be found at

Method: The authors created the FineMotion dataset with over 442,000 motion snippets and 95,000 detailed paragraphs describing full motion sequences and body part movements.

Result: Using the FineMotion dataset, the MDM model achieved a notable +15.3% improvement in Top-3 accuracy. They also established a zero-shot pipeline for fine-grained motion editing via text.

Conclusion: The FineMotion dataset enhances text-driven human motion generation and editing, particularly in fine-grained spatial and temporal dimensions.

Abstract: Generating realistic human motions from textual descriptions has undergone
significant advancements. However, existing methods often overlook specific
body part movements and their timing. In this paper, we address this issue by
enriching the textual description with more details. Specifically, we propose
the FineMotion dataset, which contains over 442,000 human motion snippets -
short segments of human motion sequences - and their corresponding detailed
descriptions of human body part movements. Additionally, the dataset includes
about 95k detailed paragraphs describing the movements of human body parts of
entire motion sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the significance of
our dataset on the text-driven finegrained human motion generation task,
especially with a remarkable +15.3% improvement in Top-3 accuracy for the MDM
model. Notably, we further support a zero-shot pipeline of fine-grained motion
editing, which focuses on detailed editing in both spatial and temporal

*Ye Lu,Jie Wang,Jianjun Gao,Rui Gong,Chen Cai,Kim-Hui Yap*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents SAMA, a framework for improved pose-lifting tasks using structure-aware and motion-adaptive methods to refine joint motion modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with modeling complex joint connections and uniform motion processing while ignoring intrinsic motion differences.

Method: SAMA uses two components: SSI for capturing spatial joint topology and MSM for recognizing joint-specific motion characteristics and applying tailored adjustments.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves advanced pose-lifting results across multiple benchmarks with reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: SAMA effectively addresses limitations in prior methods, demonstrating adaptability and efficiency in capturing intricate joint dependencies and motion dynamics.

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based methods for the pose-lifting task tend to model joint
dependencies by 2D-to-1D mapping with diverse scanning strategies. Though
effective, they struggle to model intricate joint connections and uniformly
process all joint motion trajectories while neglecting the intrinsic
differences across motion characteristics. In this work, we propose a
structure-aware and motion-adaptive framework to capture spatial joint topology
along with diverse motion dynamics independently, named as SAMA. Specifically,
SAMA consists of a Structure-aware State Integrator (SSI) and a Motion-adaptive
State Modulator (MSM). The Structure-aware State Integrator is tasked with
leveraging dynamic joint relationships to fuse information at both the joint
feature and state levels in the state space, based on pose topology rather than
sequential state transitions. The Motion-adaptive State Modulator is
responsible for joint-specific motion characteristics recognition, thus
applying tailored adjustments to diverse motion patterns across different
joints. Through the above key modules, our algorithm enables structure-aware
and motion-adaptive pose lifting. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm achieves advanced results with fewer
computational costs.

Motivation: Existing fusion methods for integrating 4D radar and monocular images struggle with either the lack of holistic scene understanding or the rigidness of BEV grid-based representations.

Method: RaGS utilizes a cascaded pipeline involving Frustum-based Localization Initiation (FLI), Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA), and Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) to create and refine a 3D Gaussian field for object detection.

Result: RaGS achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, including View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes.

Conclusion: RaGS offers an efficient, flexible, and comprehensive solution for 3D object detection by focusing dynamically on objects within a scene through 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave radar has emerged as a promising sensor for autonomous
driving, but effective 3D object detection from both 4D radar and monocular
images remains a challenge. Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either
instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene
understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we
propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as
representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection.
3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of
Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing
a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to
construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based
Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize
coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA)
fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of
interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians
into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing
on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while
offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on
View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its
state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released.

*Junwen Duan,Wei Xue,Ziyao Kang,Shixia Liu,Jiazhi Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OW-CLIP, a system for efficient open-world object detection (OWOD), addressing issues like data inefficiency, overfitting, and rigid architecture requirements, showing competitive results with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing challenges in OWOD, such as the need for extensive annotation data, partial feature overfitting, and lack of flexibility due to architecture modifications.

Method: OW-CLIP incorporates multimodal prompt tuning and a novel 'Crop-Smoothing' technique to mitigate overfitting. It also employs dual-modal data refinement methods and a visualization interface to enhance data efficiency and annotation quality.

Result: OW-CLIP achieves 89% of state-of-the-art performance using only 3.8% self-generated data and surpasses current methods when trained on comparable data volumes.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates effectiveness in OWOD settings by significantly reducing data dependency and enhancing annotation quality, proving its utility in addressing OWOD challenges.

Abstract: Open-world object detection (OWOD) extends traditional object detection to
identifying both known and unknown object, necessitating continuous model
adaptation as new annotations emerge. Current approaches face significant
limitations: 1) data-hungry training due to reliance on a large number of
crowdsourced annotations, 2) susceptibility to "partial feature overfitting,"
and 3) limited flexibility due to required model architecture modifications. To
tackle these issues, we present OW-CLIP, a visual analytics system that
provides curated data and enables data-efficient OWOD model incremental
training. OW-CLIP implements plug-and-play multimodal prompt tuning tailored
for OWOD settings and introduces a novel "Crop-Smoothing" technique to mitigate
partial feature overfitting. To meet the data requirements for the training
methodology, we propose dual-modal data refinement methods that leverage large
language models and cross-modal similarity for data generation and filtering.
Simultaneously, we develope a visualization interface that enables users to
explore and deliver high-quality annotations: including class-specific visual
feature phrases and fine-grained differentiated images. Quantitative evaluation
demonstrates that OW-CLIP achieves competitive performance at 89% of
state-of-the-art performance while requiring only 3.8% self-generated data,
while outperforming SOTA approach when trained with equivalent data volumes. A
case study shows the effectiveness of the developed method and the improved
annotation quality of our visualization system.

*Haowei Chen,Zhiwen Yang,Haotian Hou,Hui Zhang,Bingzheng Wei,Gang Zhou,Yan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiffCode, a novel framework for unified medical image restoration across MRI, CT, and PET using task-adaptive codebook banks and latent diffusion strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge in medical image restoration related to heterogeneity across tasks and diverse information losses in low-quality images.

Method: DiffCode uses a task-adaptive codebook bank to integrate HQ priors and a latent diffusion strategy to iteratively refine latent feature distributions for multi-task restoration.

Result: DiffCode demonstrates superior performance in both metrics and visual quality across MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis tasks.

Conclusion: DiffCode's innovative approach effectively combines task-specific priors and latent diffusion, making it an advanced solution for diverse medical image restoration tasks.

Abstract: All-in-one medical image restoration (MedIR) aims to address multiple MedIR
tasks using a unified model, concurrently recovering various high-quality (HQ)
medical images (e.g., MRI, CT, and PET) from low-quality (LQ) counterparts.
However, all-in-one MedIR presents significant challenges due to the
heterogeneity across different tasks. Each task involves distinct degradations,
leading to diverse information losses in LQ images. Existing methods struggle
to handle these diverse information losses associated with different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose a latent diffusion-enhanced
vector-quantized codebook prior and develop \textbf{DiffCode}, a novel
framework leveraging this prior for all-in-one MedIR. Specifically, to
compensate for diverse information losses associated with different tasks,
DiffCode constructs a task-adaptive codebook bank to integrate task-specific HQ
prior features across tasks, capturing a comprehensive prior. Furthermore, to
enhance prior retrieval from the codebook bank, DiffCode introduces a latent
diffusion strategy that utilizes the diffusion model's powerful mapping
capabilities to iteratively refine the latent feature distribution, estimating
more accurate HQ prior features during restoration. With the help of the
task-adaptive codebook bank and latent diffusion strategy, DiffCode achieves
superior performance in both quantitative metrics and visual quality across
three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis.

*Shide Du,Chunming Wu,Zihan Fang,Wendi Zhao,Yilin Wu,Changwei Wang,Shiping Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep anchor-based methods improve clustering scalability using anchors but lack optimized structural designs. LargeMvC-Net introduces a novel architecture for effective large-scale multi-view clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing deep anchor-based clustering methods, which often lack structural clarity and neglect optimization principles.

Method: Develop LargeMvC-Net by unfolding the iterative optimization process into three network modules: RepresentModule, NoiseModule, and AnchorModule.

Result: LargeMvC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods in effectiveness and scalability, validated through extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks.

Conclusion: LargeMvC-Net demonstrates superior clustering performance and scalability by integrating optimization principles within its architecture, providing structurally clear and consistent clustering solutions.

Abstract: Deep anchor-based multi-view clustering methods enhance the scalability of
neural networks by utilizing representative anchors to reduce the computational
complexity of large-scale clustering. Despite their scalability advantages,
existing approaches often incorporate anchor structures in a heuristic or
task-agnostic manner, either through post-hoc graph construction or as
auxiliary components for message passing. Such designs overlook the core
structural demands of anchor-based clustering, neglecting key optimization
principles. To bridge this gap, we revisit the underlying optimization problem
of large-scale anchor-based multi-view clustering and unfold its iterative
solution into a novel deep network architecture, termed LargeMvC-Net. The
proposed model decomposes the anchor-based clustering process into three
modules: RepresentModule, NoiseModule, and AnchorModule, corresponding to
representation learning, noise suppression, and anchor indicator estimation.
Each module is derived by unfolding a step of the original optimization
procedure into a dedicated network component, providing structural clarity and
optimization traceability. In addition, an unsupervised reconstruction loss
aligns each view with the anchor-induced latent space, encouraging consistent
clustering structures across views. Extensive experiments on several
large-scale multi-view benchmarks show that LargeMvC-Net consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both effectiveness and
scalability.

*X. Feng,S. Hu,X. Li,D. Zhang,M. Wu,J. Zhang,X. Chen,K. Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ATCTrack, a vision-language tracker that aligns multimodal target-context features dynamically for robust tracking in complex, long-term scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in vision-language tracking where traditional trackers struggle to adapt to dynamic target states and to identify relevant textual cues effectively.

Method: The authors propose ATCTrack with target-context feature modeling, temporal visual target-context modeling, and text-based precise target/context words identification and calibration.

Result: ATCTrack demonstrates new state-of-the-art performance on mainstream benchmarks.

Conclusion: ATCTrack enhances robustness in vision-language tracking by effectively aligning multimodal cues with dynamic target states. The code and models are made publicly available.

Abstract: Vision-language tracking aims to locate the target object in the video
sequence using a template patch and a language description provided in the
initial frame. To achieve robust tracking, especially in complex long-term
scenarios that reflect real-world conditions as recently highlighted by MGIT,
it is essential not only to characterize the target features but also to
utilize the context features related to the target. However, the visual and
textual target-context cues derived from the initial prompts generally align
only with the initial target state. Due to their dynamic nature, target states
are constantly changing, particularly in complex long-term sequences. It is
intractable for these cues to continuously guide Vision-Language Trackers
(VLTs). Furthermore, for the text prompts with diverse expressions, our
experiments reveal that existing VLTs struggle to discern which words pertain
to the target or the context, complicating the utilization of textual cues. In
this work, we present a novel tracker named ATCTrack, which can obtain
multimodal cues Aligned with the dynamic target states through comprehensive
Target-Context feature modeling, thereby achieving robust tracking.
Specifically, (1) for the visual modality, we propose an effective temporal
visual target-context modeling approach that provides the tracker with timely
visual cues. (2) For the textual modality, we achieve precise target words
identification solely based on textual content, and design an innovative
context words calibration method to adaptively utilize auxiliary context words.
(3) We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks and ATCTrack
achieves a new SOTA performance. The code and models will be released at:

Motivation: Eliminate numerical instabilities in classical visual servoing and enable real-time quadrotor control without dependency on explicit geometric models or markers.

Method: Developed an analytical IBVS teacher model and used a dual-path knowledge distillation to train a compact student ConvNet. Combined two-stage segmentation for improved orientation estimation and employed simulation-to-reality transfer learning.

Result: The student ConvNet achieves 11x faster inference while maintaining similar control accuracy compared to the teacher, with reduced computational and memory costs.

Conclusion: The proposed model is efficient, cost-effective, and practical for real-time onboard deployment in GPS-denied indoor environments, showcasing major improvements over classical approaches.

Abstract: This work introduces a self-supervised neuro-analytical, cost efficient,
model for visual-based quadrotor control in which a small 1.7M parameters
student ConvNet learns automatically from an analytical teacher, an improved
image-based visual servoing (IBVS) controller. Our IBVS system solves numerical
instabilities by reducing the classical visual servoing equations and enabling
efficient stable image feature detection. Through knowledge distillation, the
student model achieves 11x faster inference compared to the teacher IBVS
pipeline, while demonstrating similar control accuracy at a significantly lower
computational and memory cost. Our vision-only self-supervised neuro-analytic
control, enables quadrotor orientation and movement without requiring explicit
geometric models or fiducial markers. The proposed methodology leverages
simulation-to-reality transfer learning and is validated on a small drone
platform in GPS-denied indoor environments. Our key contributions include: (1)
an analytical IBVS teacher that solves numerical instabilities inherent in
classical approaches, (2) a two-stage segmentation pipeline combining YOLOv11
with a U-Net-based mask splitter for robust anterior-posterior vehicle
segmentation to correctly estimate the orientation of the target, and (3) an
efficient knowledge distillation dual-path system, which transfers geometric
visual servoing capabilities from the analytical IBVS teacher to a compact and
small student neural network that outperforms the teacher, while being suitable
for real-time onboard deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedS2R, a one-shot federated domain generalization for synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation in autonomous driving, achieving close accuracy to centralized training without sharing raw data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in federated domain generalization for semantic segmentation in autonomous driving, where sharing raw data between clients is infeasible.

Method: FedS2R combines an inconsistency-driven data augmentation strategy focused on unstable classes and a multi-client knowledge distillation scheme that fuses features for global model training.

Result: FedS2R outperformed individual client models and achieved only a 2 mIoU point difference compared to a model trained with simultaneous access to all client data, as tested on five diverse datasets.

Conclusion: FedS2R is effective for federated training in semantic segmentation for autonomous driving, offering near-centralized performance while maintaining data privacy.

Abstract: Federated domain generalization has shown promising progress in image
classification by enabling collaborative training across multiple clients
without sharing raw data. However, its potential in the semantic segmentation
of autonomous driving remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose FedS2R,
the first one-shot federated domain generalization framework for
synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. FedS2R comprises
two components: an inconsistency-driven data augmentation strategy that
generates images for unstable classes, and a multi-client knowledge
distillation scheme with feature fusion that distills a global model from
multiple client models. Experiments on five real-world datasets, Cityscapes,
BDD100K, Mapillary, IDD, and ACDC, show that the global model significantly
outperforms individual client models and is only 2 mIoU points behind the model
trained with simultaneous access to all client data. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of FedS2R in synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation for
autonomous driving under federated learning

TL;DR: Introduces RCA, a method improving object localization in vision-language transformers without retraining, achieving notable gains in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance object localization in existing vision-language transformers without necessitating retraining.

Method: RCA modifies final-layer attention by reducing extremes and amplifying mid-level activations to better guide predictions.

Result: Improved FitAP metric across 11 of 15 tested VLMs with up to +26.6% gains, with effectiveness related to attention sharpness and fusion model timing.

Conclusion: RCA demonstrates both performance improvements and enhanced interpretability for multimodal transformers.

Abstract: We propose Reverse Contrast Attention (RCA), a plug-in method that enhances
object localization in vision-language transformers without retraining. RCA
reweights final-layer attention by suppressing extremes and amplifying
mid-level activations to let semantically relevant but subdued tokens guide
predictions. We evaluate it on Open Vocabulary Referring Object Detection
(OV-RefOD), introducing FitAP, a confidence-free average precision metric based
on IoU and box area. RCA improves FitAP in 11 out of 15 open-source VLMs, with
gains up to $+26.6\%$. Effectiveness aligns with attention sharpness and fusion
timing; while late-fusion models benefit consistently, models like
$\texttt{DeepSeek-VL2}$ also improve, pointing to capacity and disentanglement
as key factors. RCA offers both interpretability and performance gains for
multimodal transformers.

TL;DR: This paper introduces TrackAny3D, a unified framework for category-agnostic 3D single object tracking (SOT) using large-scale pretrained 3D models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Category-specific 3D SOT models are impractical in real-world settings because they require separate models for each category and lack generalization.

Method: The method involves integrating parameter-efficient adapters, a Mixture-of-Geometry-Experts (MoGE) architecture, and a temporal context optimization strategy to enhance tracking capabilities.

Result: TrackAny3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization and competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: This work highlights the significance of unified models and demonstrates the potential of large-scale pretrained models for category-agnostic 3D SOT.

Abstract: 3D LiDAR-based single object tracking (SOT) relies on sparse and irregular
point clouds, posing challenges from geometric variations in scale, motion
patterns, and structural complexity across object categories. Current
category-specific approaches achieve good accuracy but are impractical for
real-world use, requiring separate models for each category and showing limited
generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose TrackAny3D, the first
framework to transfer large-scale pretrained 3D models for category-agnostic 3D
SOT. We first integrate parameter-efficient adapters to bridge the gap between
pretraining and tracking tasks while preserving geometric priors. Then, we
introduce a Mixture-of-Geometry-Experts (MoGE) architecture that adaptively
activates specialized subnetworks based on distinct geometric characteristics.
Additionally, we design a temporal context optimization strategy that
incorporates learnable temporal tokens and a dynamic mask weighting module to
propagate historical information and mitigate temporal drift. Experiments on
three commonly-used benchmarks show that TrackAny3D establishes new
state-of-the-art performance on category-agnostic 3D SOT, demonstrating strong
generalization and competitiveness. We hope this work will enlighten the
community on the importance of unified models and further expand the use of
large-scale pretrained models in this field.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a mini-batch training strategy for deep subspace clustering (DSC), leveraging a memory bank and a decoder-free framework, achieving scalability and competitive performance on clustering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep subspace clustering methods rely on full-batch processing, which limits scalability, making it challenging to handle large datasets and high-resolution images.

Method: The authors incorporate a memory bank to retain global feature representations for mini-batch training and utilize contrastive learning in a decoder-free framework to replace autoencoding for representation learning.

Result: The proposed method achieves efficiency, scalability, and competitive clustering performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on datasets like COIL100 and ORL.

Conclusion: Mini-batch DSC with these innovations offers a practical solution for scalable clustering of high-resolution images without sacrificing accuracy, setting a new benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Mini-batch training is a cornerstone of modern deep learning, offering
computational efficiency and scalability for training complex architectures.
However, existing deep subspace clustering (DSC) methods, which typically
combine an autoencoder with a self-expressive layer, rely on full-batch
processing. The bottleneck arises from the self-expressive module, which
requires representations of the entire dataset to construct a
self-representation coefficient matrix. In this work, we introduce a mini-batch
training strategy for DSC by integrating a memory bank that preserves global
feature representations. Our approach enables scalable training of deep
architectures for subspace clustering with high-resolution images, overcoming
previous limitations. Additionally, to efficiently fine-tune large-scale
pre-trained encoders for subspace clustering, we propose a decoder-free
framework that leverages contrastive learning instead of autoencoding for
representation learning. This design not only eliminates the computational
overhead of decoder training but also provides competitive performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves
performance comparable to full-batch methods, but outperforms other
state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods on the COIL100 and ORL datasets by
fine-tuning deep networks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces HumanSAM, a framework for classifying forgery types in human-centric synthetic videos, and provides a new dataset (HFV) for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of fine-grained detection capabilities in synthetic video forgery undermines reliability and interpretability, crucial for real-world applications.

Method: HumanSAM classifies forgeries into three types: spatial, appearance, and motion anomalies, using a dual-branch fusion of video understanding and spatial depth, complemented by a rank-based confidence enhancement strategy.

Result: HumanSAM demonstrates strong performance in binary and multi-class forgery classification compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: HumanSAM addresses critical gaps in video forgery detection by introducing a targeted classification framework and the HFV dataset, showing its potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Numerous synthesized videos from generative models, especially human-centric
ones that simulate realistic human actions, pose significant threats to human
information security and authenticity. While progress has been made in binary
forgery video detection, the lack of fine-grained understanding of forgery
types raises concerns regarding both reliability and interpretability, which
are critical for real-world applications. To address this limitation, we
propose HumanSAM, a new framework that builds upon the fundamental challenges
of video generation models. Specifically, HumanSAM aims to classify
human-centric forgeries into three distinct types of artifacts commonly
observed in generated content: spatial, appearance, and motion anomaly.To
better capture the features of geometry, semantics and spatiotemporal
consistency, we propose to generate the human forgery representation by fusing
two branches of video understanding and spatial depth. We also adopt a
rank-based confidence enhancement strategy during the training process to learn
more robust representation by introducing three prior scores. For training and
evaluation, we construct the first public benchmark, the Human-centric Forgery
Video (HFV) dataset, with all types of forgeries carefully annotated
semi-automatically. In our experiments, HumanSAM yields promising results in
comparison with state-of-the-art methods, both in binary and multi-class
forgery classification.

TL;DR: The research presents MambaVesselNet++, a hybrid framework for medical image segmentation, combining CNNs for local processing and Mamba models for long-range dependencies, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional convolution-based frameworks struggle with limited receptive fields, while vision transformers are computationally expensive due to their nonlinear self-attention mechanism. The study aims to resolve these challenges with an efficient segmentation model.

Method: A hybrid encoder-decoder architecture is proposed: Hi-Encoder uses convolutional layers for texture capture and employs Mamba to model long-range dependencies efficiently, while BF-Decoder integrates local and global information via skip connections.

Result: MambaVesselNet++ surpasses convolution-, transformer-, and Mamba-based segmentation methods across 2D, 3D, and instance segmentation tasks in medical imaging.

Conclusion: The proposed model achieves superior performance, offering a computationally efficient and effective solution for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays an important role in computer-aided
diagnosis. Traditional convolution-based U-shape segmentation architectures are
usually limited by the local receptive field. Existing vision transformers have
been widely applied to diverse medical segmentation frameworks due to their
superior capabilities of capturing global contexts. Despite the advantage, the
real-world application of vision transformers is challenged by their non-linear
self-attention mechanism, requiring huge computational costs. To address this
issue, the selective state space model (SSM) Mamba has gained recognition for
its adeptness in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data,
particularly noted for its efficient memory costs. In this paper, we propose
MambaVesselNet++, a Hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation.
Our MambaVesselNet++ is comprised of a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) and a
bifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder). In Hi-Encoder, we first devise the
texture-aware layer to capture low-level semantic features by leveraging
convolutions. Then, we utilize Mamba to effectively model long-range
dependencies with linear complexity. The Bi-Decoder adopts skip connections to
combine local and global information of the Hi-Encoder for the accurate
generation of segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MambaVesselNet++ outperforms current convolution-based, transformer-based, and
Mamba-based state-of-the-arts across diverse medical 2D, 3D, and instance
segmentation tasks. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM_Control, a framework guided by large language models (LLMs) to improve spatial control in text-to-image diffusion models, especially for complex prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency of existing methods to generate accurate images with complex spatial compositions and multiple objects inspired the creation of a more precise and adaptable framework.

Method: LLM_Control uses multimodal LLMs as global controllers to arrange spatial layouts, enhance semantic descriptions, and bind object attributes. Generated control signals are injected into the denoising network to refine attention maps based on sampling constraints.

Result: Experiments showed that LLM_Control produces competitive synthesis quality, surpassing many existing methods in handling challenging input conditions and complex prompts.

Conclusion: LLM_Control effectively enhances grounding and controllability in text-to-image generation tasks, enabling better spatial layouts and semantic alignment even in complex cases.

Abstract: Recent spatial control methods for text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
shown compelling results. However, these methods still fail to precisely follow
the control conditions and generate the corresponding images, especially when
encountering the textual prompts that contain multiple objects or have complex
spatial compositions. In this work, we present a LLM-guided framework called
LLM\_Control to address the challenges of the controllable T2I generation task.
By improving grounding capabilities, LLM\_Control is introduced to accurately
modulate the pre-trained diffusion models, where visual conditions and textual
prompts influence the structures and appearance generation in a complementary
way. We utilize the multimodal LLM as a global controller to arrange spatial
layouts, augment semantic descriptions and bind object attributes. The obtained
control signals are injected into the denoising network to refocus and enhance
attention maps according to novel sampling constraints. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments have demonstrated that LLM\_Control achieves
competitive synthesis quality compared to other state-of-the-art methods across
various pre-trained T2I models. It is noteworthy that LLM\_Control allows the
challenging input conditions on which most of the existing methods

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniCT Depth combines CNNs and Transformers for robust event-image fusion in depth estimation, excelling over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address difficulties in depth estimation using event cameras and image data, notably challenges in integration and occlusions.

Method: UniCT Depth integrates CNNs and Transformers using CcViT-DA and DCC blocks for improved fusion and texture representation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate superior performance of UniCT Depth compared to conventional methods across various metrics.

Conclusion: UniCT Depth provides an effective solution for monocular depth estimation by leveraging combined local/global feature modeling.

Abstract: Depth estimation plays a crucial role in 3D scene understanding and is
extensively used in a wide range of vision tasks. Image-based methods struggle
in challenging scenarios, while event cameras offer high dynamic range and
temporal resolution but face difficulties with sparse data. Combining event and
image data provides significant advantages, yet effective integration remains
challenging. Existing CNN-based fusion methods struggle with occlusions and
depth disparities due to limited receptive fields, while Transformer-based
fusion methods often lack deep modality interaction. To address these issues,
we propose UniCT Depth, an event-image fusion method that unifies CNNs and
Transformers to model local and global features. We propose the
Convolution-compensated ViT Dual SA (CcViT-DA) Block, designed for the encoder,
which integrates Context Modeling Self-Attention (CMSA) to capture spatial
dependencies and Modal Fusion Self-Attention (MFSA) for effective cross-modal
fusion. Furthermore, we design the tailored Detail Compensation Convolution
(DCC) Block to improve texture details and enhances edge representations.
Experiments show that UniCT Depth outperforms existing image, event, and
fusion-based monocular depth estimation methods across key metrics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AF-CLIP, a method enhancing CLIP's visual features for effective zero-/few-shot visual anomaly detection, showing promising results on industrial and medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing visual anomaly detection methods, which require extensive training samples and struggle in zero-/few-shot scenarios. Additionally, the authors aim to improve on recent efforts using CLIP by focusing its features on local anomalies.

Method: The authors propose AF-CLIP, which incorporates a lightweight adapter to emphasize anomaly-relevant patterns, a multi-scale spatial aggregation mechanism for better anomaly detection, and learnable textual prompts for describing normal and abnormal states. They optimize the method using auxiliary datasets and a composite objective function.

Result: AF-CLIP demonstrated strong zero-shot detection capabilities and generalization across industrial and medical datasets, further extendable to few-shot scenarios with memory banks.

Conclusion: AF-CLIP is an effective and generalizable method for zero-/few-shot visual anomaly detection, significantly enhancing CLIP's capabilities through visual and textual optimizations.

Abstract: Visual anomaly detection has been widely used in industrial inspection and
medical diagnosis. Existing methods typically demand substantial training
samples, limiting their utility in zero-/few-shot scenarios. While recent
efforts have leveraged CLIP's zero-shot recognition capability for this task,
they often ignore optimizing visual features to focus on local anomalies,
reducing their efficacy. In this work, we propose AF-CLIP (Anomaly-Focused
CLIP) by dramatically enhancing its visual representations to focus on local
defects. Our approach introduces a lightweight adapter that emphasizes
anomaly-relevant patterns in visual features, simultaneously optimizing both
class-level features for image classification and patch-level features for
precise localization. To capture anomalies of different sizes and improve
detection accuracy, prior to the adapter, we develop a multi-scale spatial
aggregation mechanism to effectively consolidate neighborhood context.
Complementing these visual enhancements, we design learnable textual prompts
that generically characterize normal and abnormal states. After optimization on
auxiliary datasets using a composite objective function, AF-CLIP demonstrates
strong zero-shot detection capability. Our method is also extended to few-shot
scenarios by extra memory banks. Experimental results across diverse industrial
and medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our
proposed method. Code is available at https://github.com/Faustinaqq/AF-CLIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance point cloud registration methods using semantic correspondences inspired by diffusion-based techniques, addressing challenges like insufficient accuracy and generalization in existing methods.

Method: The method projects point clouds into depth maps, extracts diffusion features from pretrained networks, and integrates them with geometric features from existing point cloud registration techniques for improved correspondences.

Result: The approach yields significantly enhanced registration accuracy and robust generalization across diverse datasets, as validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed technique effectively refines point cloud registration algorithms by combining diffusion-based semantic correspondences with geometric features, showcasing its utility and adaptability for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent research leveraging large-scale pretrained diffusion models has
demonstrated the potential of using diffusion features to establish semantic
correspondences in images. Inspired by advancements in diffusion-based
techniques, we propose a novel zero-shot method for refining point cloud
registration algorithms. Our approach leverages correspondences derived from
depth images to enhance point feature representations, eliminating the need for
a dedicated training dataset. Specifically, we first project the point cloud
into depth maps from multiple perspectives and extract implicit knowledge from
a pretrained diffusion network as depth diffusion features. These features are
then integrated with geometric features obtained from existing methods to
establish more accurate correspondences between point clouds. By leveraging
these refined correspondences, our approach achieves significantly improved
registration accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not
only enhances the performance of existing point cloud registration techniques
but also exhibits robust generalization capabilities across diverse datasets.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a vital tool for diagnosing heart diseases.
However, many disease patterns are derived from outdated datasets and
traditional stepwise algorithms with limited accuracy. This study presents a
method for direct cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis from ECG images,
eliminating the need for digitization. The proposed approach utilizes a
two-step curriculum learning framework, beginning with the pre-training of a

ensemble of three models with averaged outputs, achieving an AUC of 0.9534 and
an F1 score of 0.7801 on the BHF ECG Challenge dataset, outperforming
individual models. By effectively handling real-world artifacts and simplifying
the diagnostic process, this method offers a reliable solution for automated
CVD diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings where printed or
scanned ECG images are commonly used. Such an automated procedure enables rapid
and accurate diagnosis, which is critical for timely intervention in CVD cases
that often demand urgent care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for generating 3D semantic scene graphs are inefficient and lack the ability to process data incrementally, making them unsuitable for real-time applications.

Method: FROSS directly lifts 2D scene graphs to 3D space, using 3D Gaussian distributions for object representation, and eliminates reliance on computationally-intensive point cloud processing.

Result: FROSS demonstrates superior performance and faster processing compared to previous methods in evaluations using the ReplicaSSG and 3DSSG datasets.

Conclusion: FROSS provides an innovative, efficient solution for online 3D semantic scene graph generation and contributes new annotations with the ReplicaSSG dataset to advance the field.

Abstract: The ability to abstract complex 3D environments into simplified and
structured representations is crucial across various domains. 3D semantic scene
graphs (SSGs) achieve this by representing objects as nodes and their
interrelationships as edges, facilitating high-level scene understanding.
Existing methods for 3D SSG generation, however, face significant challenges,
including high computational demands and non-incremental processing that hinder
their suitability for real-time open-world applications. To address this issue,
we propose FROSS (Faster-than-Real-Time Online 3D Semantic Scene Graph
Generation), an innovative approach for online and faster-than-real-time 3D SSG
generation that leverages the direct lifting of 2D scene graphs to 3D space and
represents objects as 3D Gaussian distributions. This framework eliminates the
dependency on precise and computationally-intensive point cloud processing.
Furthermore, we extend the Replica dataset with inter-object relationship
annotations, creating the ReplicaSSG dataset for comprehensive evaluation of
FROSS. The experimental results from evaluations on ReplicaSSG and 3DSSG
datasets show that FROSS can achieve superior performance while operating
significantly faster than prior 3D SSG generation methods. Our implementation

self-supervised learning hold immense potential for advancing medical research.
However, it is crucial to recognise that transfer learning and self-supervised
learning architectures exhibit distinct advantages and limitations, manifesting
variations in accuracy, training speed, and robustness. This paper compares the
performance and robustness of transfer learning and self-supervised learning in
the medical field. Specifically, we pre-trained two models using the same

*Lehan Wang,Hualiang Wang,Chubin Ou,Lushi Chen,Yunyi Liang,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment based on OCT angiography (OCTA) imaging and a custom deep learning model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for CVD risk assessment rely on retinal imaging techniques like fundus photography and OCT, which lack detailed vascular features essential for accurate CVD risk prediction. Additionally, most systems only classify risk as high or low without addressing specific blood factor conditions.

Method: The authors developed OCTA-CVD, the first comprehensive dataset for CVD risk assessment leveraging OCTA images, and proposed a Vessel-Aware Mamba-based Prediction model with Informative Enhancement (VAMPIRE). The VAMPIRE model extracts vascular characteristics through a Mamba-Based Directional (MBD) Module and an Information-Enhanced Morphological (IEM) Module.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate that VAMPIRE outperforms standard classification models, OCTA-based methods, and ophthalmologic foundation models in both CVD risk and condition prediction.

Conclusion: This study provides a significant advancement in CVD risk prediction, offering a more detailed and clinically useful analysis of vascular features and CVD-related blood factor conditions through novel methods and datasets.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide,
requiring urgent development of effective risk assessment methods for timely
intervention. While current research has introduced non-invasive and efficient
approaches to predict CVD risk from retinal imaging with deep learning models,
the commonly used fundus photographs and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
fail to capture detailed vascular features critical for CVD assessment compared
with OCT angiography (OCTA) images. Moreover, existing methods typically
classify CVD risk only as high or low, without providing a deeper analysis on
CVD-related blood factor conditions, thus limiting prediction accuracy and
clinical utility. As a result, we propose a novel multi-purpose paradigm of CVD
risk assessment that jointly performs CVD risk and CVD-related condition
prediction, aligning with clinical experiences. Based on this core idea, we
introduce OCTA-CVD, the first OCTA dataset for CVD risk assessment, and a
Vessel-Aware Mamba-based Prediction model with Informative Enhancement
(VAMPIRE) based on OCTA enface images. Our proposed model aims to extract
crucial vascular characteristics through two key components: (1) a Mamba-Based
Directional (MBD) Module that captures fine-grained vascular trajectory
features and (2) an Information-Enhanced Morphological (IEM) Module that
incorporates comprehensive vessel morphology knowledge. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method can surpass standard classification backbones,
OCTA-based detection methods, and ophthalmologic foundation models. Our codes
and the collected OCTA-CVD dataset are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RICE, a novel method for improving region-level visual and OCR capabilities, addressing limitations of global representation models like CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models excel in global representations but struggle with dense prediction tasks, creating a demand for region-level enhancements.

Method: RICE combines a billion-scale candidate region dataset, a Region Transformer layer, and unified region cluster discrimination loss for scalable training.

Result: RICE surpasses previous methods in segmentation, dense detection, and multimodal visual perception according to experimental results.

Conclusion: RICE improves regional visual capabilities in dense prediction tasks and accelerates advancements with released pre-trained models.

Abstract: Learning visual representations is foundational for a broad spectrum of
downstream tasks. Although recent vision-language contrastive models, such as
CLIP and SigLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot performance via large-scale
vision-language alignment, their reliance on global representations constrains
their effectiveness for dense prediction tasks, such as grounding, OCR, and
segmentation. To address this gap, we introduce Region-Aware Cluster
Discrimination (RICE), a novel method that enhances region-level visual and OCR
capabilities. We first construct a billion-scale candidate region dataset and
propose a Region Transformer layer to extract rich regional semantics. We
further design a unified region cluster discrimination loss that jointly
supports object and OCR learning within a single classification framework,
enabling efficient and scalable distributed training on large-scale data.
Extensive experiments show that RICE consistently outperforms previous methods
on tasks, including segmentation, dense detection, and visual perception for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The pre-trained models have been
released at https://github.com/deepglint/MVT.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a test-time active learning framework that adaptively queries uncertain samples and updates prompts in real-time streaming scenarios, achieving improved performance in vision-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of utilizing an oracle in a continuous data stream, where only one sample is available at a time, requiring immediate decisions under strict latency and memory constraints.

Method: The proposed TTAL framework introduces a dynamically adjusted uncertainty threshold for querying, a memory-efficient class-balanced replacement strategy, and a class-aware distribution alignment technique for adapting to new data efficiently.

Result: Extensive experiments across 10 cross-dataset transfer and 4 domain generalization benchmarks show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods in performance, latency, and memory usage.

Conclusion: The framework delivers a practical solution for real-world, safety-critical applications, showcasing its effectiveness in scenarios like autonomous systems and medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Test-Time Optimization enables models to adapt to new data during inference
by updating parameters on-the-fly. Recent advances in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have explored learning prompts at test time to improve performance in
downstream tasks. In this work, we extend this idea by addressing a more
general and practical challenge: Can we effectively utilize an oracle in a
continuous data stream where only one sample is available at a time, requiring
an immediate query decision while respecting latency and memory constraints? To
tackle this, we propose a novel Test-Time Active Learning (TTAL) framework that
adaptively queries uncertain samples and updates prompts dynamically. Unlike
prior methods that assume batched data or multiple gradient updates, our
approach operates in a real-time streaming scenario with a single test sample
per step. We introduce a dynamically adjusted entropy threshold for active
querying, a class-balanced replacement strategy for memory efficiency, and a
class-aware distribution alignment technique to enhance adaptation. The design
choices are justified using careful theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments
across 10 cross-dataset transfer benchmarks and 4 domain generalization
datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining reasonable latency and memory overhead. Our framework
provides a practical and effective solution for real-world deployment in
safety-critical applications such as autonomous systems and medical
diagnostics.

*Ze Rong,ZiYue Zhao,Zhaoxin Wang,Lei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FaRMamba, a medical image segmentation method addressing issues with blurred lesion boundaries, high-frequency detail loss, and long-range structural modeling. FaRMamba achieves this through two new modules: a Multi-Scale Frequency Transform Module and a Self-Supervised Reconstruction Auxiliary Encoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in accurate medical image segmentation such as blurred lesion boundaries, loss of high-frequency details, and difficulty in modeling long-range anatomical structures.

Method: Introduced FaRMamba, a model that incorporates a Multi-Scale Frequency Transform Module (for high-frequency detail restoration) and a Self-Supervised Reconstruction Auxiliary Encoder (to enhance spatial correlations).

Result: Extensive testing on various medical imaging datasets showed FaRMamba outperformed existing hybrid models and achieved superior boundary accuracy, detail preservation, and global coherence.

Conclusion: FaRMamba provides a flexible and effective framework for medical image segmentation, addressing core challenges without significant computational overhead.

Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation remains challenging due to blurred lesion
boundaries (LBA), loss of high-frequency details (LHD), and difficulty in
modeling long-range anatomical structures (DC-LRSS). Vision Mamba employs
one-dimensional causal state-space recurrence to efficiently model global
dependencies, thereby substantially mitigating DC-LRSS. However, its patch
tokenization and 1D serialization disrupt local pixel adjacency and impose a
low-pass filtering effect, resulting in Local High-frequency Information
Capture Deficiency (LHICD) and two-dimensional Spatial Structure Degradation
(2D-SSD), which in turn exacerbate LBA and LHD. In this work, we propose
FaRMamba, a novel extension that explicitly addresses LHICD and 2D-SSD through
two complementary modules. A Multi-Scale Frequency Transform Module (MSFM)
restores attenuated high-frequency cues by isolating and reconstructing
multi-band spectra via wavelet, cosine, and Fourier transforms. A
Self-Supervised Reconstruction Auxiliary Encoder (SSRAE) enforces pixel-level
reconstruction on the shared Mamba encoder to recover full 2D spatial
correlations, enhancing both fine textures and global context. Extensive
evaluations on CAMUS echocardiography, MRI-based Mouse-cochlea, and Kvasir-Seg
endoscopy demonstrate that FaRMamba consistently outperforms competitive
CNN-Transformer hybrids and existing Mamba variants, delivering superior
boundary accuracy, detail preservation, and global coherence without
prohibitive computational overhead. This work provides a flexible
frequency-aware framework for future segmentation models that directly
mitigates core challenges in medical imaging.

TL;DR: This paper improves image captioning by addressing the bias towards the end-of-sequence token in vision-language models, enhancing caption details and length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image captions often lack detail due to models terminating early, despite sophisticated vision and language backbones.

Method: The paper proposes an unsupervised method to reduce premature end-of-sequence token prediction, encouraging longer, detailed captions without supervision or complex reward functions.

Result: The approach improved caption length and detail across three VLMs and benchmarks, but increased the rate of hallucinations.

Conclusion: A simple bias reduction method significantly enhances detailed captioning, showcasing efficacy and applicability to various pretrained models.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), image
captioning often suffers from a lack of detail, with base models producing
short, generic captions. This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped
with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex
reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we
identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS)
token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an
unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token
prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more
detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or
supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable
to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments
with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a
substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an
expected increase in the rate of hallucinations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between pose accuracy and overall image quality in human image generation, which existing methods often fail to balance.

Method: The authors proposed Knowledge-Based Global Guidance (KB) for leveraging both pose and image features, and Dynamic Masking (DM) for adjusting focus on pose-related regions.

Result: Experiments show that KB-DMGen surpasses previous methods in AP and CAP metrics, setting state-of-the-art results on the HumanArt dataset.

Conclusion: KB-DMGen effectively enhances both pose accuracy and global image quality in human image synthesis and will be shared with the research community through publicly available code.

Abstract: Recent methods using diffusion models have made significant progress in human
image generation with various control signals such as pose priors. In portrait
generation, both the accuracy of human pose and the overall visual quality are
crucial for realistic synthesis. Most existing methods focus on controlling the
accuracy of generated poses, but ignore the quality assurance of the entire
image. In order to ensure the global image quality and pose accuracy, we
propose Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic pose Masking for human
image Generation (KB-DMGen). The Knowledge Base (KB) is designed not only to
enhance pose accuracy but also to leverage image feature information to
maintain overall image quality. Dynamic Masking (DM) dynamically adjusts the
importance of pose-related regions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model, achieving new state-of-the-art results in terms of AP and CAP on
the HumanArt dataset. The code will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Local Prompt Adaptation (LPA), a training-free method to improve the coherence and style uniformity in text-to-image diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with generating coherent scenes for complex prompts involving multiple objects and varying style specifications.

Method: LPA decomposes prompts into content and style tokens, conditionally injecting them into different stages of the diffusion model's U-Net attention layers.

Result: LPA achieved superior performance in layout control and stylistic consistency compared to strong baselines using a custom benchmark.

Conclusion: LPA provides an effective and simple architectural solution for controllable and expressive text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a powerful backbone for text-to-image
generation, enabling users to synthesize high-quality visuals from natural
language prompts. However, they often struggle with complex prompts involving
multiple objects and global or local style specifications. In such cases, the
generated scenes tend to lack style uniformity and spatial coherence, limiting
their utility in creative and controllable content generation. In this paper,
we propose a simple, training-free architectural method called Local Prompt
Adaptation (LPA). Our method decomposes the prompt into content and style
tokens, and injects them selectively into the U-Net's attention layers at
different stages. By conditioning object tokens early and style tokens later in
the generation process, LPA enhances both layout control and stylistic
consistency. We evaluate our method on a custom benchmark of 50 style-rich
prompts across five categories and compare against strong baselines including
Composer, MultiDiffusion, Attend-and-Excite, LoRA, and SDXL. Our approach
outperforms prior work on both CLIP score and style consistency metrics,
offering a new direction for controllable, expressive diffusion-based
generation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel denoising framework for hyperspectral images (HSI) called HDST, which utilizes frequency domain enhancement and multiscale modeling for collaborative spatial, frequency, and channel processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hyperspectral image denoising techniques struggle with the multidimensional complexity of spatially non-uniform noise and spectral correlation interference due to their reliance on methods designed for simpler RGB images.

Method: The proposed Hybrid-Domain Synergistic Transformer Network (HDST) uses three innovative mechanisms: (1) FFT preprocessing with multi-band convolution for cross-band correlation and spectral noise decoupling, (2) dynamic cross-domain attention for spatial and frequency domain feature fusion, and (3) a hierarchical architecture employing multiscale atrous convolution and frequency-domain postprocessing.

Result: Experiments on both real and synthetic HSI datasets demonstrate that HDST significantly enhances denoising performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The HDST method offers a robust framework for overcoming complex noise coupling in hyperspectral and other high-dimensional visual data, providing new insights for the field.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image denoising faces the challenge of multi-dimensional
coupling of spatially non-uniform noise and spectral correlation interference.
Existing deep learning methods mostly focus on RGB images and struggle to
effectively handle the unique spatial-spectral characteristics and complex
noise distributions of hyperspectral images (HSI). This paper proposes an HSI
denoising framework, Hybrid-Domain Synergistic Transformer Network (HDST),
based on frequency domain enhancement and multiscale modeling, achieving
three-dimensional collaborative processing of spatial, frequency and channel
domains. The method innovatively integrates three key mechanisms: (1)
introducing an FFT preprocessing module with multi-band convolution to extract
cross-band correlations and decouple spectral noise components; (2) designing a
dynamic cross-domain attention module that adaptively fuses spatial domain
texture features and frequency domain noise priors through a learnable gating
mechanism; (3) building a hierarchical architecture where shallow layers
capture global noise statistics using multiscale atrous convolution, and deep
layers achieve detail recovery through frequency domain postprocessing.
Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that HDST
significantly improves denoising performance while maintaining computational
efficiency, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method. This research
provides new insights and a universal framework for addressing complex noise
coupling issues in HSI and other high-dimensional visual data. The code is

Motivation: Medial epicondyle avulsion, common in baseball players, involves bone detachment and deformity detectable via bone structure discontinuities. Identifying such abnormalities necessitates understanding the normal bone's structure and continuity.

Method: The authors used a masked autoencoder to build a structure-aware reconstruction model trained on normal images, which highlights abnormalities by producing high reconstruction errors at avulsion sites.

Result: The method achieved notable performance with a pixel-wise AUC of 0.965 and an image-wise AUC of 0.967. A dataset with ultrasound images and annotations was also created and shared publicly.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively detected medial epicondyle avulsion in ultrasound images and surpassed existing techniques, demonstrating the robustness of their reconstruction-based approach.

Abstract: This study proposes a reconstruction-based framework for detecting medial
epicondyle avulsion in elbow ultrasound images, trained exclusively on normal
cases. Medial epicondyle avulsion, commonly observed in baseball players,
involves bone detachment and deformity, often appearing as discontinuities in
bone contour. Therefore, learning the structure and continuity of normal bone
is essential for detecting such abnormalities. To achieve this, we propose a
masked autoencoder-based, structure-aware reconstruction framework that learns
the continuity of normal bone structures. Even in the presence of avulsion, the
model attempts to reconstruct the normal structure, resulting in large
reconstruction errors at the avulsion site. For evaluation, we constructed a
novel dataset comprising normal and avulsion ultrasound images from 16 baseball
players, with pixel-level annotations under orthopedic supervision. Our method
outperformed existing approaches, achieving a pixel-wise AUC of 0.965 and an
image-wise AUC of 0.967. The dataset is publicly available at:

*Shiyu Liu,Lianlei Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeuroVoxel-LM, a framework combining Neural Radiance Fields with novel techniques for efficient and accurate 3D scene perception from sparse point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D language models struggle with feature extraction and representation accuracy when dealing with sparse, large-scale point clouds.

Method: The authors propose Dynamic Resolution Multiscale Voxelization (DR-MSV) and Token-level Adaptive Pooling for Lightweight Meta-Embedding (TAP-LME) techniques within their NeuroVoxel-LM framework.

Result: DR-MSV improves computational efficiency and accuracy in feature extraction, while TAP-LME enhances semantic representation compared to max-pooling.

Conclusion: The proposed NeuroVoxel-LM framework significantly advances 3D language-driven cognition by addressing key limitations in current approaches.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Visual Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced 3D scene perception towards
language-driven cognition. However, existing 3D language models struggle with
sparse, large-scale point clouds due to slow feature extraction and limited
representation accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroVoxel-LM,
a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with dynamic
resolution voxelization and lightweight meta-embedding. Specifically, we
introduce a Dynamic Resolution Multiscale Voxelization (DR-MSV) technique that
adaptively adjusts voxel granularity based on geometric and structural
complexity, reducing computational cost while preserving reconstruction
fidelity. In addition, we propose the Token-level Adaptive Pooling for
Lightweight Meta-Embedding (TAP-LME) mechanism, which enhances semantic
representation through attention-based weighting and residual fusion.
Experimental results demonstrate that DR-MSV significantly improves point cloud
feature extraction efficiency and accuracy, while TAP-LME outperforms
conventional max-pooling in capturing fine-grained semantics from NeRF weights.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a real-time 3D crowd evacuation simulation framework that incorporates advanced human behavior modeling and visualization tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of mainstream evacuation models that fail to accurately simulate complex human behaviors such as collisions, interpersonal interactions, and variations influenced by terrain or body shape.

Method: The framework employs an SDM-aligned approach with a 3D-adaptive SFM Decision Mechanism, Personalized Gait Control Motor, and Part-level Force Visualization for real-time simulation.

Result: The proposed framework supports dynamic trajectory planning, personalized agent behavior, compatibility with uneven terrains, and generates visually realistic evacuation results.

Conclusion: The framework enhances public safety analysis and realistic crowd simulation, providing better insights into evacuation dynamics and offering a publicly available codebase.

Abstract: Crowd evacuation simulation is critical for enhancing public safety, and
demanded for realistic virtual environments. Current mainstream evacuation
models overlook the complex human behaviors that occur during evacuation, such
as pedestrian collisions, interpersonal interactions, and variations in
behavior influenced by terrain types or individual body shapes. This results in
the failure to accurately simulate the escape of people in the real world. In
this paper, aligned with the sensory-decision-motor (SDM) flow of the human
brain, we propose a real-time 3D crowd evacuation simulation framework that
integrates a 3D-adaptive SFM (Social Force Model) Decision Mechanism and a
Personalized Gait Control Motor. This framework allows multiple agents to move
in parallel and is suitable for various scenarios, with dynamic crowd
awareness. Additionally, we introduce Part-level Force Visualization to assist
in evacuation analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
supports dynamic trajectory planning and personalized behavior for each agent
throughout the evacuation process, and is compatible with uneven terrain.
Visually, our method generates evacuation results that are more realistic and
plausible, providing enhanced insights for crowd simulation. The code is

TL;DR: The paper proposes Local2Global, an innovative online framework for video instance segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance through novel query mechanisms and seamless alignment, outperforming existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is to address challenges in achieving temporally consistent video instance segmentation, such as noise accumulation, drift in propagation, and abrupt scene transitions.

Method: The method involves introducing local and global queries to capture spatial and spatio-temporal features, and L2G-aligner, a lightweight transformer decoder, to align these queries for improved temporal consistency and smooth frame transitions.

Result: The Local2Global method significantly outperforms existing benchmarks on challenging datasets including Youtube-VIS-19/-21 and OVIS with simple online training, showcasing superior accuracy metrics.

Conclusion: The Local2Global framework delivers a robust and efficient solution for real-world video segmentation applications, combining simplicity with top-notch performance while overcoming temporal consistency issues.

Abstract: Online video segmentation methods excel at handling long sequences and
capturing gradual changes, making them ideal for real-world applications.
However, achieving temporally consistent predictions remains a challenge,
especially with gradual accumulation of noise or drift in on-line propagation,
abrupt occlusions and scene transitions. This paper introduces Local2Global, an
online framework, for video instance segmentation, exhibiting state-of-the-art
performance with simple baseline and training purely in online fashion.
Leveraging the DETR-based query propagation framework, we introduce two novel
sets of queries:(1) local queries that capture initial object-specific spatial
features from each frame and (2) global queries containing past spatio-temporal
representations. We propose the L2G-aligner, a novel lightweight transformer
decoder, to facilitate an early alignment between local and global queries.
This alignment allows our model to effectively utilize current frame
information while maintaining temporal consistency, producing a smooth
transition between frames. Furthermore, L2G-aligner is integrated within the
segmentation model, without relying on additional complex heuristics, or memory
mechanisms. Extensive experiments across various challenging VIS and VPS
datasets showcase the superiority of our method with simple online training,
surpassing current benchmarks without bells and rings. For instance, we achieve
54.3 and 49.4 AP on Youtube-VIS-19/-21 datasets and 37.0 AP on OVIS dataset
respectively withthe ResNet-50 backbone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of consideration in existing machine learning models about the interrelation between plant species and disease types, which impacts prediction performance.

Method: The proposed model, Mo-DsCC, combines a modified VGG-16 network, deep supervision training, and classification chains to weave predictions for plant species and diseases.

Result: Experimental evaluations using Plant Village and PlantDoc datasets show that Mo-DsCC outperforms recent approaches in terms of accuracy and F1-score.

Conclusion: Mo-DsCC could potentially enhance smart agriculture, benefiting farms and generating novel insights for both industry and academia.

Abstract: Plant leaf disease classification is an important task in smart agriculture
which plays a critical role in sustainable production. Modern machine learning
approaches have shown unprecedented potential in this classification task which
offers an array of benefits including time saving and cost reduction. However,
most recent approaches directly employ convolutional neural networks where the
effect of the relationship between plant species and disease types on
prediction performance is not properly studied. In this study, we proposed a
new model named Multi-output Deep Supervised Classifier Chains (Mo-DsCC) which
weaves the prediction of plant species and disease by chaining the output
layers for the two labels. Mo-DsCC consists of three components: A modified
VGG-16 network as the backbone, deep supervision training, and a stack of
classification chains. To evaluate the advantages of our model, we perform
intensive experiments on two benchmark datasets Plant Village and PlantDoc.
Comparison to recent approaches, including multi-model, multi-label
(Power-set), multi-output and multi-task, demonstrates that Mo-DsCC achieves
better accuracy and F1-score. The empirical study in this paper shows that the
application of Mo-DsCC could be a useful puzzle for smart agriculture to
benefit farms and bring new ideas to industry and academia.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frequent misalignments in visible-infrared object detection caused by resolution disparities, spatial displacements, and modality inconsistencies.

Method: Proposing WMNet, which combines wavelet-based multi-frequency analysis and modality-aware fusion mechanisms to align and fuse cross-modal features adaptively.

Result: WMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on DVTOD, DroneVehicle, and M3FD datasets for misaligned cross-modal object detection.

Conclusion: The wavelet-guided approach of WMNet proves effective for addressing cross-modal misalignments, leading to improved and robust object detection in visible-infrared imagery.

Abstract: Visible-infrared object detection aims to enhance the detection robustness by
exploiting the complementary information of visible and infrared image pairs.
However, its performance is often limited by frequent misalignments caused by
resolution disparities, spatial displacements, and modality inconsistencies. To
address this issue, we propose the Wavelet-guided Misalignment-aware Network
(WMNet), a unified framework designed to adaptively address different
cross-modal misalignment patterns. WMNet incorporates wavelet-based
multi-frequency analysis and modality-aware fusion mechanisms to improve the
alignment and integration of cross-modal features. By jointly exploiting low
and high-frequency information and introducing adaptive guidance across
modalities, WMNet alleviates the adverse effects of noise, illumination
variation, and spatial misalignment. Furthermore, it enhances the
representation of salient target features while suppressing spurious or
misleading information, thereby promoting more accurate and robust detection.
Extensive evaluations on the DVTOD, DroneVehicle, and M3FD datasets demonstrate
that WMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on misaligned cross-modal
object detection tasks, confirming its effectiveness and practical
applicability.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of brightness mismatch in supervised low-light image enhancement (LLIE), introducing a novel GT-mean loss to improve model training and overall outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the brightness mismatch problem in supervised LLIE that negatively affects model training but has been largely overlooked.

Method: The method involves introducing the GT-mean loss function, which models image mean values probabilistically and can be integrated into existing loss functions with minimal computational overhead.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent performance improvements across different LLIE methods and datasets when using the GT-mean loss.

Conclusion: The GT-mean loss is effective in mitigating brightness mismatch and enhancing supervised LLIE models, proving its value as a flexible and cost-efficient addition.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve the visual quality of
images captured under poor lighting conditions. In supervised LLIE research,
there exists a significant yet often overlooked inconsistency between the
overall brightness of an enhanced image and its ground truth counterpart,
referred to as brightness mismatch in this study. Brightness mismatch
negatively impact supervised LLIE models by misleading model training. However,
this issue is largely neglected in current research. In this context, we
propose the GT-mean loss, a simple yet effective loss function directly
modeling the mean values of images from a probabilistic perspective. The
GT-mean loss is flexible, as it extends existing supervised LLIE loss functions
into the GT-mean form with minimal additional computational costs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the incorporation of the GT-mean loss results in
consistent performance improvements across various methods and datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a lightweight approach to improve vision-language model datasets by applying a compact VLM for high-precision filtration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of maintaining high data quality in vision-language model training, particularly when visual inputs can introduce noise in the data.

Method: A small, fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) evaluates and filters training samples based on their caption and image alignment quality, eliminating noisy and inaccurate data.

Result: Experimental results show that high-quality datasets filtered using this compact VLM achieve comparable or better performance than larger, noisier datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight filtration framework provides an efficient and effective solution for creating high-quality datasets for vision-language model training, reducing computational overhead without sacrificing model performance.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) extend the conventional large language models
by integrating visual data, enabling richer multimodal reasoning and
significantly broadens the practical applications of AI. However, including
visual inputs also brings new challenges in maintaining data quality. Empirical
evidence consistently shows that carefully curated and representative training
examples often yield superior results compared to simply increasing the
quantity of data. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a streamlined data
filtration framework that employs a compact VLM, fine-tuned on a high-quality
image-caption annotated dataset. This model effectively evaluates and filters
potential training samples based on caption and image quality and alignment.
Unlike previous approaches, which typically add auxiliary filtration modules on
top of existing full-scale VLMs, our method exclusively utilizes the inherent
evaluative capability of a purpose-built small VLM. This strategy eliminates
the need for extra modules and reduces training overhead. Our lightweight model
efficiently filters out inaccurate, noisy web data, improving image-text
alignment and caption linguistic fluency. Experimental results show that
datasets underwent high-precision filtration using our compact VLM perform on
par with, or even surpass, larger and noisier datasets gathered through
high-volume web crawling. Thus, our method provides a lightweight yet robust
solution for building high-quality vision-language training corpora. \\

TL;DR: The paper introduces AnimeColor, a Diffusion Transformers-based framework for reference-based animation colorization, emphasizing improved color accuracy and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing animation colorization methods face challenges in achieving color accuracy and maintaining temporal consistency, which limits their effectiveness in animation production.

Method: The framework integrates sketch sequences into a DiT-based video diffusion model. It includes a High-level Color Extractor for semantic color information and a Low-level Color Guider for fine-grained details. A multi-stage training strategy enhances the use of reference images.

Result: Extensive experiments show that AnimeColor significantly improves animation color accuracy, sketch alignment, temporal consistency, and overall visual quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: AnimeColor advances animation colorization techniques with practical industrial applications, addressing key limitations in existing methods with an efficient and high-quality approach.

Abstract: Animation colorization plays a vital role in animation production, yet
existing methods struggle to achieve color accuracy and temporal consistency.
To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AnimeColor}, a novel
reference-based animation colorization framework leveraging Diffusion
Transformers (DiT). Our approach integrates sketch sequences into a DiT-based
video diffusion model, enabling sketch-controlled animation generation. We
introduce two key components: a High-level Color Extractor (HCE) to capture
semantic color information and a Low-level Color Guider (LCG) to extract
fine-grained color details from reference images. These components work
synergistically to guide the video diffusion process. Additionally, we employ a
multi-stage training strategy to maximize the utilization of reference image
color information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnimeColor
outperforms existing methods in color accuracy, sketch alignment, temporal
consistency, and visual quality. Our framework not only advances the state of
the art in animation colorization but also provides a practical solution for
industrial applications. The code will be made publicly available at

*Zeyu Xi,Haoying Sun,Yaofei Wu,Junchi Yan,Haoran Zhang,Lifang Wu,Liang Wang,Changwen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new sports video captioning model (LLM-IAVC) is proposed, which generates player-identity-aware descriptions using multimodal prompts derived from video content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sports video captioning methods struggle to accurately include player identities in their descriptions, as they rely on external, often unrelated, information.

Method: The paper presents a Player-Centric Multimodal Prompt Generation Network (LLM-IAVC) that uses three modules: an Identity-Related Information Extraction Module (IRIEM) with a Player Identification Network (PIN) and a Bidirectional Semantic Interaction Module (BSIM), as well as a Visual Context Learning Module (VCLM). These modules work together to generate multimodal prompts, linking player identities with video content.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two datasets, NBA-Identity and VC-NBA-2022, due to its effective player-identity recognition and multimodal context integration.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-IAVC method improves identity-aware sports video captioning and is validated on a new dataset, NBA-Identity, paving the way for more accurate descriptions in sports analysis.

Abstract: Existing sports video captioning methods often focus on the action yet
overlook player identities, limiting their applicability. Although some methods
integrate extra information to generate identity-aware descriptions, the player
identities are sometimes incorrect because the extra information is independent
of the video content. This paper proposes a player-centric multimodal prompt
generation network for identity-aware sports video captioning (LLM-IAVC), which
focuses on recognizing player identities from a visual perspective.
Specifically, an identity-related information extraction module (IRIEM) is
designed to extract player-related multimodal embeddings. IRIEM includes a
player identification network (PIN) for extracting visual features and player
names, and a bidirectional semantic interaction module (BSIM) to link player
features with video content for mutual enhancement. Additionally, a visual
context learning module (VCLM) is designed to capture the key video context
information. Finally, by integrating the outputs of the above modules as the
multimodal prompt for the large language model (LLM), it facilitates the
generation of descriptions with player identities. To support this work, we
construct a new benchmark called NBA-Identity, a large identity-aware
basketball video captioning dataset with 9,726 videos covering 9 major event
types. The experimental results on NBA-Identity and VC-NBA-2022 demonstrate
that our proposed model achieves advanced performance. Code and dataset are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PUMPS, an autoencoder architecture for Temporal Point Clouds (TPCs), enabling efficient motion data synthesis and learning in a cross-compatible format.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion data transfer across skeletons with different proportions or structures is challenging. Temporal Point Clouds (TPCs) offer compatibility but lack data synthesis capabilities for direct learning tasks, necessitating a new approach.

Method: The authors design PUMPS, an autoencoder that compresses frame-wise point clouds into latent feature vectors and decodes them into identifiable temporal points using Gaussian noise vectors. Linear assignment-based point pairing is used for reconstruction, avoiding expensive attention mechanisms.

Result: PUMPS achieves state-of-the-art performance in tasks like motion prediction, transition generation, and keyframe interpolation during pre-training, even without dataset supervision. It also surpasses other methods in motion denoising or estimation when fine-tuned.

Conclusion: PUMPS introduces a versatile architecture for TPCs, effectively addressing motion-related tasks while remaining efficient and generalist.

Abstract: Motion skeletons drive 3D character animation by transforming bone
hierarchies, but differences in proportions or structure make motion data hard
to transfer across skeletons, posing challenges for data-driven motion
synthesis. Temporal Point Clouds (TPCs) offer an unstructured, cross-compatible
motion representation. Though reversible with skeletons, TPCs mainly serve for
compatibility, not for direct motion task learning. Doing so would require data
synthesis capabilities for the TPC format, which presents unexplored challenges
regarding its unique temporal consistency and point identifiability. Therefore,
we propose PUMPS, the primordial autoencoder architecture for TPC data. PUMPS
independently reduces frame-wise point clouds into sampleable feature vectors,
from which a decoder extracts distinct temporal points using latent Gaussian
noise vectors as sampling identifiers. We introduce linear assignment-based
point pairing to optimise the TPC reconstruction process, and negate the use of
expensive point-wise attention mechanisms in the architecture. Using these
latent features, we pre-train a motion synthesis model capable of performing
motion prediction, transition generation, and keyframe interpolation. For these
pre-training tasks, PUMPS performs remarkably well even without native dataset
supervision, matching state-of-the-art performance. When fine-tuned for motion
denoising or estimation, PUMPS outperforms many respective methods without
deviating from its generalist architecture.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) understand spatial relationships and introduces a benchmark to evaluate their performance. Results show current VLMs lag behind humans, particularly on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding and evaluation regarding how Vision-Language Models perceive spatial relationships and movement, which are crucial for applications like autonomous driving and humanoid robotics.

Method: The authors propose a synthetic dataset and evaluation pipeline to test absolute spatial understanding (e.g., left/right position in images) and 3D spatial understanding (movement and rotation) of VLMs.

Result: Experiments show humans achieve near-perfect scores, whereas VLMs only match humans on simple tasks and perform poorly—sometimes with near-zero scores—on more complex spatial understanding tasks.

Conclusion: Current Vision-Language Models have significant limitations in spatial understanding, indicating the need for substantial improvement in this area.

Abstract: Real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and humanoid robot
manipulation, require precise spatial perception. However, it remains
underexplored how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) recognize spatial relationships
and perceive spatial movement. In this work, we introduce a spatial evaluation
pipeline and construct a corresponding benchmark. Specifically, we categorize
spatial understanding into two main types: absolute spatial understanding,
which involves querying the absolute spatial position (e.g., left, right) of an
object within an image, and 3D spatial understanding, which includes movement
and rotation. Notably, our dataset is entirely synthetic, enabling the
generation of test samples at a low cost while also preventing dataset
contamination. We conduct experiments on multiple state-of-the-art VLMs and
observe that there is significant room for improvement in their spatial
understanding abilities. Explicitly, in our experiments, humans achieve
near-perfect performance on all tasks, whereas current VLMs attain human-level
performance only on the two simplest tasks. For the remaining tasks, the
performance of VLMs is distinctly lower than that of humans. In fact, the
best-performing Vision-Language Models even achieve near-zero scores on
multiple tasks. The dataset and code are available on

TL;DR: The paper presents a universal tracking model, ModalTracker, leveraging online dense temporal token learning for various modalities (e.g., RGB, RGB+Thermal). It achieves state-of-the-art performance, simplifies multi-modal training, and offers better representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to create a unified tracking solution that supports diverse modalities while improving efficiency and representation through a simplified training approach.

Method: The method employs video-level sampling to broaden context understanding, online dense temporal token mechanisms for association, and gated perceivers for cross-modal learning compressed into unified parameters via one-shot training.

Result: The proposed ModalTracker consistently delivers state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both visible and multi-modal tracking benchmarks.

Conclusion: The ModalTracker simplifies multi-modal training while advancing tracking performance across modalities, marking its utility in various applications.

Abstract: We propose a universal video-level modality-awareness tracking model with
online dense temporal token learning (called {\modaltracker}). It is designed
to support various tracking tasks, including RGB, RGB+Thermal, RGB+Depth, and
RGB+Event, utilizing the same model architecture and parameters. Specifically,
our model is designed with three core goals: \textbf{Video-level Sampling}. We
expand the model's inputs to a video sequence level, aiming to see a richer
video context from an near-global perspective. \textbf{Video-level
Association}. Furthermore, we introduce two simple yet effective online dense
temporal token association mechanisms to propagate the appearance and motion
trajectory information of target via a video stream manner. \textbf{Modality
Scalable}. We propose two novel gated perceivers that adaptively learn
cross-modal representations via a gated attention mechanism, and subsequently
compress them into the same set of model parameters via a one-shot training
manner for multi-task inference. This new solution brings the following
benefits: (i) The purified token sequences can serve as temporal prompts for
the inference in the next video frames, whereby previous information is
leveraged to guide future inference. (ii) Unlike multi-modal trackers that
require independent training, our one-shot training scheme not only alleviates
the training burden, but also improves model representation. Extensive
experiments on visible and multi-modal benchmarks show that our {\modaltracker}
achieves a new \textit{SOTA} performance. The code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoCTEFuse, an adaptive image fusion network that improves infrared-visible fusion quality by addressing illumination imbalance via a Chiral Transformer-based approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to account for illumination changes, leading to modality bias in fused results.

Method: The proposed MoCTEFuse network dynamically adjusts image fusion using illumination-gated networks and asymmetric cross-attention mechanisms, progressively refining information through stacked blocks.

Result: MoCTEFuse demonstrated superior performance across multiple datasets, achieving state-of-the-art detection mean Average Precision (mAP) results on MFNet and DroneVehicle datasets.

Conclusion: MoCTEFuse effectively balances texture detail preservation and object contrast adaptation, offering improved image fusion quality under varying illumination conditions.

Abstract: While illumination changes inevitably affect the quality of infrared and
visible image fusion, many outstanding methods still ignore this factor and
directly merge the information from source images, leading to modality bias in
the fused results. To this end, we propose a dynamic multi-level image fusion
network called MoCTEFuse, which applies an illumination-gated Mixture of Chiral
Transformer Experts (MoCTE) to adaptively preserve texture details and object
contrasts in balance. MoCTE consists of high- and low-illumination expert
subnetworks, each built upon the Chiral Transformer Fusion Block (CTFB). Guided
by the illumination gating signals, CTFB dynamically switches between the
primary and auxiliary modalities as well as assigning them corresponding
weights with its asymmetric cross-attention mechanism. Meanwhile, it is stacked
at multiple stages to progressively aggregate and refine modality-specific and
cross-modality information. To facilitate robust training, we propose a
competitive loss function that integrates illumination distributions with three
levels of sub-loss terms. Extensive experiments conducted on the DroneVehicle,
MSRS, TNO and RoadScene datasets show MoCTEFuse's superior fusion performance.
Finally, it achieves the best detection mean Average Precision (mAP) of 70.93%
on the MFNet dataset and 45.14% on the DroneVehicle dataset. The code and model
are released at https://github.com/Bitlijinfu/MoCTEFuse.

Method: The paper proposes SAMwave, which leverages wavelet transforms for multi-scale high-frequency feature extraction and introduces complex-valued adapters for spatial-frequency information integration.

Result: Empirical evaluations on four low-level vision tasks show that SAMwave significantly outperforms current adaptation strategies across SAM and SAM2 backbones.

Conclusion: SAMwave provides an interpretable, efficient, and flexible solution to adapt advanced segmentation models like SAM for challenging tasks.

Abstract: The emergence of large foundation models has propelled significant advances
in various domains. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a leading model for image
segmentation, exemplifies these advances, outperforming traditional methods.
However, such foundation models often suffer from performance degradation when
applied to complex tasks for which they are not trained. Existing methods
typically employ adapter-based fine-tuning strategies to adapt SAM for tasks
and leverage high-frequency features extracted from the Fourier domain.
However, Our analysis reveals that these approaches offer limited benefits due
to constraints in their feature extraction techniques. To overcome this, we
propose \textbf{\textit{SAMwave}}, a novel and interpretable approach that
utilizes the wavelet transform to extract richer, multi-scale high-frequency
features from input data. Extending this, we introduce complex-valued adapters
capable of capturing complex-valued spatial-frequency information via complex
wavelet transforms. By adaptively integrating these wavelet coefficients,
SAMwave enables SAM's encoder to capture information more relevant for dense
prediction. Empirical evaluations on four challenging low-level vision tasks
demonstrate that SAMwave significantly outperforms existing adaptation methods.
This superior performance is consistent across both the SAM and SAM2 backbones
and holds for both real and complex-valued adapter variants, highlighting the
efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability of our proposed method for
adapting segment anything models.

*Mohammed-En-Nadhir Zighem,Abdenour Hadid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAViL-Det, a new model for multi-script and arbitrarily-shaped text detection, integrates semantics from text prompts with visual features to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in detecting diverse-script and arbitrarily-shaped text in natural scenes, often due to insufficient semantic context in current methods.

Method: SAViL-Det employs a pre-trained CLIP model, an Asymptotic Feature Pyramid Network, a novel language-vision decoder with cross-modal attention, and a text-to-pixel contrastive learning mechanism.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with F-scores of 84.8% on the MLT-2019 dataset and 90.2% on the CTW1500 dataset.

Conclusion: SAViL-Det successfully integrates semantic and visual information, significantly improving multi-script and shape-aware text detection in natural scenes.

Abstract: Detecting text in natural scenes remains challenging, particularly for
diverse scripts and arbitrarily shaped instances where visual cues alone are
often insufficient. Existing methods do not fully leverage semantic context.
This paper introduces SAViL-Det, a novel semantic-aware vision-language model
that enhances multi-script text detection by effectively integrating textual
prompts with visual features. SAViL-Det utilizes a pre-trained CLIP model
combined with an Asymptotic Feature Pyramid Network (AFPN) for multi-scale
visual feature fusion. The core of the proposed framework is a novel
language-vision decoder that adaptively propagates fine-grained semantic
information from text prompts to visual features via cross-modal attention.
Furthermore, a text-to-pixel contrastive learning mechanism explicitly aligns
textual and corresponding visual pixel features. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
achieving state-of-the-art performance with F-scores of 84.8% on the benchmark
multi-lingual MLT-2019 dataset and 90.2% on the curved-text CTW1500 dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study examines the effectiveness of computer vision methods for classifying facial expressions in a sign language dataset, achieving high recognition accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how computer vision methods can correctly classify facial expressions, especially focusing on differences between hearing and deaf individuals.

Method: The study employs a color normalization stage using histogram equalization and fine-tuning, and conducts experiments on upper and lower facial regions independently.

Result: The method achieved 83.8% sensitivity, with classification accuracy from the lower half of the face at 79.6%, and the upper half at 77.9%. Notably, upper face recognition surpassed human performance.

Conclusion: Computer vision methods perform well in facial expression recognition tasks, with specific insights into the differences in accuracy between facial regions and outperforming human-level accuracy in upper facial analysis.

Abstract: The goal of this investigation is to quantify to what extent computer vision
methods can correctly classify facial expressions on a sign language dataset.
We extend our experiments by recognizing expressions using only the upper or
lower part of the face, which is needed to further investigate the difference
in emotion manifestation between hearing and deaf subjects. To take into
account the peculiar color profile of a dataset, our method introduces a color
normalization stage based on histogram equalization and fine-tuning. The
results show the ability to correctly recognize facial expressions with 83.8%
mean sensitivity and very little variance (.042) among classes. Like for
humans, recognition of expressions from the lower half of the face (79.6%) is
higher than that from the upper half (77.9%). Noticeably, the classification
accuracy from the upper half of the face is higher than human level.

*Kele Shao,Keda Tao,Kejia Zhang,Sicheng Feng,Mu Cai,Yuzhang Shang,Haoxuan You,Can Qin,Yang Sui,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper surveys the field of token compression for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), addressing computational challenges due to long and complex input contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational inefficiencies of self-attention mechanisms in MLLMs arising from processing long and complex multimodal contexts.

Method: The paper categorizes token compression approaches by modality (image, video, audio) and mechanism (transformation, similarity, attention, query) to streamline their accessibility to researchers.

Result: A comprehensive and structured overview of token compression methods is provided, along with a public repository to track developments in the field.

Conclusion: The work consolidates existing methods, pinpoints challenges, and promotes future research in multimodal token compression for MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides,
largely driven by their ability to process increasingly long and complex
contexts, such as high-resolution images, extended video sequences, and lengthy
audio input. While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it
introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic
complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate
these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical
approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and
inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis
of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression.
Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique
characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing
approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access
and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1)
image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data;
(2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in
dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal
and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven
categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying
mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based,
and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured
overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key
challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving
domain. We also maintain a public repository to continuously track and update
the latest advances in this promising area.

*Shuqi Fan,Haoyi Wang,Xianju Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dual-branch fusion model for accurate scene classification in mining areas using global and local features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in mining area classification caused by complex spatial layouts and multi-scale characteristics.

Method: A dual-branch fusion model is created, with multi-scale global transformers, local collaborative representation, and a feature fusion module.

Result: The model achieved an overall accuracy of 83.63%, outperforming comparative models and metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively improves the classification of complex mining area landscapes by integrating global and local features.

Abstract: Scene classification of mining areas provides accurate foundational data for
geological environment monitoring and resource development planning. This study
fuses multi-source data to construct a multi-modal mine land cover scene
classification dataset. A significant challenge in mining area classification
lies in the complex spatial layout and multi-scale characteristics. By
extracting global and local features, it becomes possible to comprehensively
reflect the spatial distribution, thereby enabling a more accurate capture of
the holistic characteristics of mining scenes. We propose a dual-branch fusion
model utilizing collaborative representation to decompose global features into
a set of key semantic vectors. This model comprises three key components:(1)
Multi-scale Global Transformer Branch: It leverages adjacent large-scale
features to generate global channel attention features for small-scale
features, effectively capturing the multi-scale feature relationships. (2)
Local Enhancement Collaborative Representation Branch: It refines the attention
weights by leveraging local features and reconstructed key semantic sets,
ensuring that the local context and detailed characteristics of the mining area
are effectively integrated. This enhances the model's sensitivity to
fine-grained spatial variations. (3) Dual-Branch Deep Feature Fusion Module: It
fuses the complementary features of the two branches to incorporate more scene
information. This fusion strengthens the model's ability to distinguish and
classify complex mining landscapes. Finally, this study employs multi-loss
computation to ensure a balanced integration of the modules. The overall
accuracy of this model is 83.63%, which outperforms other comparative models.
Additionally, it achieves the best performance across all other evaluation
metrics.

*Bohong Chen,Yumeng Li,Youyi Zheng,Yao-Xiang Ding,Kun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MECo, a framework for generating co-speech gestures controlled by motion examples using fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), achieving state-of-the-art results while preserving motion details and speech congruence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing gesture generation systems that rely on predefined labels or implicit pseudo-labels, which often lose the rich motion details of the examples.

Method: The approach involves fine-tuning LLMs to interpret both speech audio and motion examples, using them as explicit query contexts in prompts to guide gesture generation, while enabling granular control over body parts and diverse input modalities.

Result: MECo achieves state-of-the-art performance across metrics like Fréchet Gesture Distance (FGD), motion diversity, and example-gesture similarity. It also supports diverse input types and provides fine-grained control.

Conclusion: MECo successfully generates controllable and detailed co-speech gestures, overcoming the limitations of conventional methods by making use of LLMs' interpretative capabilities and an innovative query context strategy.

Abstract: The automatic generation of controllable co-speech gestures has recently
gained growing attention. While existing systems typically achieve gesture
control through predefined categorical labels or implicit pseudo-labels derived
from motion examples, these approaches often compromise the rich details
present in the original motion examples. We present MECo, a framework for
motion-example-controlled co-speech gesture generation by leveraging large
language models (LLMs). Our method capitalizes on LLMs' comprehension
capabilities through fine-tuning to simultaneously interpret speech audio and
motion examples, enabling the synthesis of gestures that preserve
example-specific characteristics while maintaining speech congruence. Departing
from conventional pseudo-labeling paradigms, we position motion examples as
explicit query contexts within the prompt structure to guide gesture
generation. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance
across three metrics: Fr\'echet Gesture Distance (FGD), motion diversity, and
example-gesture similarity. Furthermore, our framework enables granular control
of individual body parts and accommodates diverse input modalities including
motion clips, static poses, human video sequences, and textual descriptions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MambaMap is a novel framework for constructing online vectorized HD maps in autonomous driving, improving temporal feature fusion, accuracy, and robustness against challenges like occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for HD map construction in autonomous driving face challenges in effectively exploiting temporal information and managing computational overhead.

Method: The framework utilizes a memory bank for historical frame integration, a gating mechanism for efficient state space dependencies, and innovative scanning strategies for advanced feature extraction.

Result: MambaMap achieves superior prediction accuracy and temporal consistency, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets.

Conclusion: MambaMap represents a promising advancement in autonomous driving technology, enabling robust and efficient HD map generation with extended perception capabilities.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, as they
provide precise road information for downstream tasks. Recent advances
highlight the potential of temporal modeling in addressing challenges like
occlusions and extended perception range. However, existing methods either fail
to fully exploit temporal information or incur substantial computational
overhead in handling extended sequences. To tackle these challenges, we propose
MambaMap, a novel framework that efficiently fuses long-range temporal features
in the state space to construct online vectorized HD maps. Specifically,
MambaMap incorporates a memory bank to store and utilize information from
historical frames, dynamically updating BEV features and instance queries to
improve robustness against noise and occlusions. Moreover, we introduce a
gating mechanism in the state space, selectively integrating dependencies of
map elements in high computational efficiency. In addition, we design
innovative multi-directional and spatial-temporal scanning strategies to
enhance feature extraction at both BEV and instance levels. These strategies
significantly boost the prediction accuracy of our approach while ensuring
robust temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and
Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed MambaMap approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across various splits and perception ranges. Source

*Binxiao Huang,Zhengwu Liu,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a global-to-local densification strategy and an energy-guided multi-resolution framework to improve efficiency in 3D Gaussian Splatting's training process, achieving over 2x speedup and better reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the slow convergence and inefficiencies in the training process of 3D Gaussian Splatting, particularly in the densification and spatial distribution of Gaussian primitives.

Method: The method includes a global-to-local densification strategy for more efficient growth of Gaussians, an energy-guided coarse-to-fine multi-resolution training framework, and dynamic pruning of unnecessary Gaussian primitives.

Result: The approach yields a significant acceleration in training (over 2x speedup) with fewer Gaussian primitives while maintaining superior reconstruction performance. Experiments validated the claims on MipNeRF-360, Deep Blending, and Tanks & Temples datasets.

Conclusion: The methods improve both computational efficiency and detail preservation in 3D Gaussian Splatting, addressing the inefficiencies in the current training process and offering better results.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a powerful representation for
high-quality scene reconstruction, offering compelling rendering quality.
However, the training process of GS often suffers from slow convergence due to
inefficient densification and suboptimal spatial distribution of Gaussian
primitives. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the split and
clone operations during the densification phase, revealing their distinct roles
in balancing detail preservation and computational efficiency. Building upon
this analysis, we propose a global-to-local densification strategy, which
facilitates more efficient growth of Gaussians across the scene space,
promoting both global coverage and local refinement. To cooperate with the
proposed densification strategy and promote sufficient diffusion of Gaussian
primitives in space, we introduce an energy-guided coarse-to-fine
multi-resolution training framework, which gradually increases resolution based
on energy density in 2D images. Additionally, we dynamically prune unnecessary
Gaussian primitives to speed up the training. Extensive experiments on
MipNeRF-360, Deep Blending, and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that our
approach significantly accelerates training,achieving over 2x speedup with
fewer Gaussian primitives and superior reconstruction performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AnimalClue, a novel large-scale dataset designed for identifying wildlife species from indirect evidence such as footprints and feces, aiming to address challenges in traditional wildlife monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for robust wildlife observation methodologies, particularly in identifying species from indirect evidence—a crucial yet understudied area in wildlife monitoring.

Method: The researchers created AnimalClue, a dataset of 159,605 bounding boxes across five categories of indirect clues. It includes species-level labels, segmentation masks, and comprehensive trait data. They evaluated vision models for classification, detection, and segmentation tasks.

Result: AnimalClue encompasses 968 species and presents significant challenges for vision models due to its focus on subtle visual features in indirect evidence. The experiments highlighted key limitations in current technologies.

Conclusion: AnimalClue is the first dataset of its kind, offering a valuable research resource to improve species identification methods using indirect evidence, thereby enhancing wildlife monitoring practices.

Abstract: Wildlife observation plays an important role in biodiversity conservation,
necessitating robust methodologies for monitoring wildlife populations and
interspecies interactions. Recent advances in computer vision have
significantly contributed to automating fundamental wildlife observation tasks,
such as animal detection and species identification. However, accurately
identifying species from indirect evidence like footprints and feces remains
relatively underexplored, despite its importance in contributing to wildlife
monitoring. To bridge this gap, we introduce AnimalClue, the first large-scale
dataset for species identification from images of indirect evidence. Our
dataset consists of 159,605 bounding boxes encompassing five categories of
indirect clues: footprints, feces, eggs, bones, and feathers. It covers 968
species, 200 families, and 65 orders. Each image is annotated with
species-level labels, bounding boxes or segmentation masks, and fine-grained
trait information, including activity patterns and habitat preferences. Unlike
existing datasets primarily focused on direct visual features (e.g., animal
appearances), AnimalClue presents unique challenges for classification,
detection, and instance segmentation tasks due to the need for recognizing more
detailed and subtle visual features. In our experiments, we extensively
evaluate representative vision models and identify key challenges in animal
identification from their traces. Our dataset and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG foundation models fail to consider paradigm-specific neurophysiological characteristics, hampering their generalization. For practical applications like stroke rehabilitation or robotics, the paradigm (e.g., MI) is predetermined.

Method: MIRepNet consists of a robust EEG preprocessing pipeline adaptable to diverse headsets and employs a hybrid training approach combining self-supervised learning with supervised MI classification to enhance task adaptability.

Result: MIRepNet outperforms existing specialized and generalized EEG models across five public MI datasets, showcasing state-of-the-art performance with minimal data requirements.

Conclusion: MIRepNet is a paradigm-specific foundation model for MI tasks, offering enhanced generalization, quick adaptation, and improved accuracy for practical BCIs.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the
brain and external devices. Recent EEG foundation models aim to learn
generalized representations across diverse BCI paradigms. However, these
approaches overlook fundamental paradigm-specific neurophysiological
distinctions, limiting their generalization ability. Importantly, in practical
BCI deployments, the specific paradigm such as motor imagery (MI) for stroke
rehabilitation or assistive robotics, is generally determined prior to data
acquisition. This paper proposes MIRepNet, the first EEG foundation model
tailored for the MI paradigm. MIRepNet comprises a high-quality EEG
preprocessing pipeline incorporating a neurophysiologically-informed channel
template, adaptable to EEG headsets with arbitrary electrode configurations.
Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid pretraining strategy that combines
self-supervised masked token reconstruction and supervised MI classification,
facilitating rapid adaptation and accurate decoding on novel downstream MI
tasks with fewer than 30 trials per class. Extensive evaluations across five
public MI datasets demonstrated that MIRepNet consistently achieved
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both specialized and
generalized EEG models. Our code will be available on

Abstract: We propose the Lightweight Multimodal Contrastive Attention Transformer
(L-MCAT), a novel transformer-based framework for label-efficient remote
sensing image classification using unpaired multimodal satellite data. L-MCAT
introduces two core innovations: (1) Modality-Spectral Adapters (MSA) that
compress high-dimensional sensor inputs into a unified embedding space, and (2)
Unpaired Multimodal Attention Alignment (U-MAA), a contrastive self-supervised
mechanism integrated into the attention layers to align heterogeneous
modalities without pixel-level correspondence or labels. L-MCAT achieves 95.4%
overall accuracy on the SEN12MS dataset using only 20 labels per class,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines while using 47x fewer parameters and
23x fewer FLOPs than MCTrans. It maintains over 92% accuracy even under 50%

*Yooshin Cho,Hanbyel Cho,Janghyeon Lee,HyeongGwon Hong,Jaesung Ahn,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper tackles bias in deep neural networks by introducing controllable feature whitening to eliminate linear correlations, improving reliability and fairness without complex methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid rise in AI usage necessitates trustworthy systems, but biases due to spurious correlations in datasets undermine reliability.

Method: A whitening module is used to quantify and remove linear correlations between target and bias features using the covariance matrix, without relying on regularization or adversarial learning.

Result: The proposed method significantly reduces bias and effectively handles fairness criteria like demographic parity and equalized odds, outperforming competing approaches on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Controllable feature whitening is a practical and effective solution for balancing utility and fairness in biased datasets, with superior performance and stable optimization.

Abstract: As the use of artificial intelligence rapidly increases, the development of
trustworthy artificial intelligence has become important. However, recent
studies have shown that deep neural networks are susceptible to learn spurious
correlations present in datasets. To improve the reliability, we propose a
simple yet effective framework called controllable feature whitening. We
quantify the linear correlation between the target and bias features by the
covariance matrix, and eliminate it through the whitening module. Our results
systemically demonstrate that removing the linear correlations between features
fed into the last linear classifier significantly mitigates the bias, while
avoiding the need to model intractable higher-order dependencies. A particular
advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require regularization
terms or adversarial learning, which often leads to unstable optimization in
practice. Furthermore, we show that two fairness criteria, demographic parity
and equalized odds, can be effectively handled by whitening with the
re-weighted covariance matrix. Consequently, our method controls the trade-off
between the utility and fairness of algorithms by adjusting the weighting
coefficient. Finally, we validate that our method outperforms existing
approaches on four benchmark datasets: Corrupted CIFAR-10, Biased FFHQ,
WaterBirds, and Celeb-A.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces T$^3$SVFND, a framework improving fake news video detection under distribution shifts using Test-Time Training with self-supervised auxiliary tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fake news video detection techniques poorly generalize under varying distributions, especially with emergency news.

Method: The proposed T$^3$SVFND leverages Test-Time Training. It uses a self-supervised task with Mask Language Modeling to predict masked words by integrating multi-modal information during test-time training.

Result: Experiments on public benchmarks reveal the framework's enhanced effectiveness in detecting fake news, particularly for emergency scenarios.

Conclusion: T$^3$SVFND proves robust in handling distribution shifts, especially in emergency news, showcasing improved fake news detection.

Abstract: The existing methods for fake news videos detection may not be generalized,
because there is a distribution shift between short video news of different
events, and the performance of such techniques greatly drops if news records
are coming from emergencies. We propose a new fake news videos detection
framework (T$^3$SVFND) using Test-Time Training (TTT) to alleviate this
limitation, enhancing the robustness of fake news videos detection.
Specifically, we design a self-supervised auxiliary task based on Mask Language
Modeling (MLM) that masks a certain percentage of words in text and predicts
these masked words by combining contextual information from different
modalities (audio and video). In the test-time training phase, the model adapts
to the distribution of test data through auxiliary tasks. Extensive experiments
on the public benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model,
especially for the detection of emergency news.

### [227] [Fine-structure Preserved Real-world Image Super-resolution via Transfer VAE Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20291)
*Qiaosi Yi,Shuai Li,Rongyuan Wu,Lingchen Sun,Yuhui Wu,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses poor fine-structure reconstruction in image super-resolution using pre-trained Stable Diffusion models by proposing a new strategy called Transfer VAE Training (TVT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve image fine-structure reconstruction (e.g., small characters and textures) in Real-ISR, which is hindered by aggressive resolution reduction in the Stable Diffusion model's VAE component.

Method: The paper introduces the TVT strategy, where the VAE of the Stable Diffusion model is transferred from 8× resolution reduction to 4× by sequentially training its decoder and encoder while aligning them with the original latent space. Furthermore, compact architectures for both VAE and UNet are developed to reduce computational costs.

Result: Experimental results show enhanced preservation of fine-structures with fewer computational requirements compared to current state-of-the-art diffusion models.

Conclusion: The proposed TVT method effectively addresses issues in fine-structure reconstruction for image super-resolution while optimizing computational efficiency.

Abstract: Impressive results on real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have been
achieved by employing pre-trained stable diffusion (SD) models. However, one
critical issue of such methods lies in their poor reconstruction of image fine
structures, such as small characters and textures, due to the aggressive
resolution reduction of the VAE (eg., 8$\times$ downsampling) in the SD model.
One solution is to employ a VAE with a lower downsampling rate for diffusion;
however, adapting its latent features with the pre-trained UNet while
mitigating the increased computational cost poses new challenges. To address
these issues, we propose a Transfer VAE Training (TVT) strategy to transfer the
8$\times$ downsampled VAE into a 4$\times$ one while adapting to the
pre-trained UNet. Specifically, we first train a 4$\times$ decoder based on the
output features of the original VAE encoder, then train a 4$\times$ encoder
while keeping the newly trained decoder fixed. Such a TVT strategy aligns the
new encoder-decoder pair with the original VAE latent space while enhancing
image fine details. Additionally, we introduce a compact VAE and
compute-efficient UNet by optimizing their network architectures, reducing the
computational cost while capturing high-resolution fine-scale features.
Experimental results demonstrate that our TVT method significantly improves
fine-structure preservation, which is often compromised by other SD-based
methods, while requiring fewer FLOPs than state-of-the-art one-step diffusion
models. The official code can be found at https://github.com/Joyies/TVT.

*Zeyu Xia,Chenxi Sun,Tianyu Xin,Yubo Zeng,Haoyu Chen,Liang-Jian Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SWIFT, a new framework for improving pansharpening performance across unseen sensors, reducing adaptation time while maintaining state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep-learning-based pansharpening methods experience significant performance degradation when applied to data from unseen sensors. Retraining models or creating complex architectures is resource-intensive and impractical in real-world settings.

Method: SWIFT uses an unsupervised sampling method to select only 3% of the target domain's most informative samples. It then probes pre-trained models to identify sensitive weights for quick updating, avoiding full-scale retraining.

Result: SWIFT drastically reduces adaptation time to around one minute while enabling pansharpening models to perform better than direct-transfer baselines and competitively with or surpassing models requiring full retraining.

Conclusion: SWIFT is a fast, effective, and general-purpose plug-and-play framework for adapting pansharpening models between different sensor datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Pansharpening aims to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images with
low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) images to generate high-resolution
multispectral (HRMS) images. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved
promising performance, they generally suffer from severe performance
degradation when applied to data from unseen sensors. Adapting these models
through full-scale retraining or designing more complex architectures is often
prohibitively expensive and impractical for real-world deployment. To address
this critical challenge, we propose a fast and general-purpose framework for
cross-sensor adaptation, SWIFT (Sensitive Weight Identification for Fast
Transfer). Specifically, SWIFT employs an unsupervised sampling strategy based
on data manifold structures to balance sample selection while mitigating the
bias of traditional Farthest Point Sampling, efficiently selecting only 3\% of
the most informative samples from the target domain. This subset is then used
to probe a source-domain pre-trained model by analyzing the gradient behavior
of its parameters, allowing for the quick identification and subsequent update
of only the weight subset most sensitive to the domain shift. As a
plug-and-play framework, SWIFT can be applied to various existing pansharpening
models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWIFT reduces the adaptation
time from hours to approximately one minute on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.
The adapted models not only substantially outperform direct-transfer baselines
but also achieve performance competitive with, and in some cases superior to,
full retraining, establishing a new state-of-the-art on cross-sensor
pansharpening tasks for the WorldView-2 and QuickBird datasets.

### [229] [From Gallery to Wrist: Realistic 3D Bracelet Insertion in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20331)
*Chenjian Gao,Lihe Ding,Rui Han,Zhanpeng Huang,Zibin Wang,Tianfan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid pipeline combining 3D rendering and 2D diffusion models for realistic and temporally consistent 3D object insertion into videos, focusing on bracelets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome challenges in achieving temporal and photorealistic consistency when inserting 3D objects into videos with dynamic motion, perspective changes, and varying illumination.

Method: The approach blends 3D Gaussian Splatting for temporal consistency with a 2D diffusion-based enhancement to achieve realistic lighting. A shading-driven pipeline is used that separately refines intrinsic object properties like albedo and reflectance.

Result: The hybrid method successfully integrates bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes in videos with photorealistic lighting and temporal coherence.

Conclusion: The proposed method marks the first synergistic use of 3D rendering and 2D diffusion models for video object insertion, providing a robust solution to balance realism and consistency in dynamic settings.

Abstract: Inserting 3D objects into videos is a longstanding challenge in computer
graphics with applications in augmented reality, virtual try-on, and video
composition. Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains
difficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion,
perspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have
shown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with
maintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D
rendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in
achieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object
insertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically,
we focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high
temporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and
refining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure
realistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven
pipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading,
reflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To
maintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame
weighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and
2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for
realistic and consistent video editing. Project Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PIVOTS, a neural network for registering preoperative to intraoperative liver data, showing robustness to deformation and noise, and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to improve non-rigid registration in Augmented Reality-guided laparoscopic liver surgery, addressing challenges like large deformations, noisy data, and limited field of view.

Method: The proposed method, PIVOTS, uses a neural network with a geometric feature extraction encoder and deformation-aware cross-attention modules. It handles point clouds for deformation prediction and is trained on synthetic data.

Result: The PIVOTS model demonstrates superior registration performance over existing methods, showing robustness to noise, significant deformations, and reduced intraoperative visibility.

Conclusion: PIVOTS successfully addresses major challenges in liver registration for augmented reality surgery, offering improved accuracy and robustness. Datasets and code are publicly shared for benchmarking.

Abstract: Non-rigid registration is essential for Augmented Reality guided laparoscopic
liver surgery by fusing preoperative information, such as tumor location and
vascular structures, into the limited intraoperative view, thereby enhancing
surgical navigation. A prerequisite is the accurate prediction of
intraoperative liver deformation which remains highly challenging due to
factors such as large deformation caused by pneumoperitoneum, respiration and
tool interaction as well as noisy intraoperative data, and limited field of
view due to occlusion and constrained camera movement. To address these
challenges, we introduce PIVOTS, a Preoperative to Intraoperative
VOlume-To-Surface registration neural network that directly takes point clouds
as input for deformation prediction. The geometric feature extraction encoder
allows multi-resolution feature extraction, and the decoder, comprising novel
deformation aware cross attention modules, enables pre- and intraoperative
information interaction and accurate multi-level displacement prediction. We
train the neural network on synthetic data simulated from a biomechanical
simulation pipeline and validate its performance on both synthetic and real
datasets. Results demonstrate superior registration performance of our method
compared to baseline methods, exhibiting strong robustness against high amounts
of noise, large deformation, and various levels of intraoperative visibility.
We publish the training and test sets as evaluation benchmarks and call for a
fair comparison of liver registration methods with volume-to-surface data. Code
and datasets are available here https://github.com/pengliu-nct/PIVOTS.

*Yanming Xiu,Maria Gorlatova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in augmented reality (AR) and proposes detection methods. It introduces a taxonomy, dataset, and detection framework achieving high accuracy and low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Augmented reality (AR) can provide misleading or harmful virtual content causing user errors or semantic misunderstandings. The paper aims to study and combat visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks.

Method: The authors propose a taxonomy for categorizing VIM attacks, construct the AR-VIM dataset with 452 AR video pairs, and develop the multimodal semantic reasoning framework, VIM-Sense, combining vision-language models (VLMs) and OCR-based textual analysis.

Result: VIM-Sense achieves an attack detection accuracy of 88.94% on AR-VIM, significantly outperforming baseline methods. In simulated and real-world settings, it maintains low detection latency (around 7 seconds).

Conclusion: The study effectively highlights AR VIM security threats and provides a promising detection framework that combines visual and textual understanding, paving the way for secure AR applications.

Abstract: The virtual content in augmented reality (AR) can introduce misleading or
harmful information, leading to semantic misunderstandings or user errors. In
this work, we focus on visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in AR
where virtual content changes the meaning of real-world scenes in subtle but
impactful ways. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes these attacks into
three formats: character, phrase, and pattern manipulation, and three purposes:
information replacement, information obfuscation, and extra wrong information.
Based on the taxonomy, we construct a dataset, AR-VIM. It consists of 452
raw-AR video pairs spanning 202 different scenes, each simulating a real-world
AR scenario. To detect such attacks, we propose a multimodal semantic reasoning
framework, VIM-Sense. It combines the language and visual understanding
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) with optical character
recognition (OCR)-based textual analysis. VIM-Sense achieves an attack
detection accuracy of 88.94% on AR-VIM, consistently outperforming vision-only
and text-only baselines. The system reaches an average attack detection latency
of 7.07 seconds in a simulated video processing framework and 7.17 seconds in a
real-world evaluation conducted on a mobile Android AR application.

### [232] [Generative Pre-training for Subjective Tasks: A Diffusion Transformer-Based Framework for Facial Beauty Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20363)
*Djamel Eddine Boukhari,Ali chemsa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Diff-FBP, a novel generative approach to facial beauty prediction that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FBP5500 benchmark, leveraging pre-trained diffusion transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore improved methods to address limitations in facial beauty prediction, particularly in aligning feature representations with aesthetic assessment.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) Pre-training a Diffusion Transformer via self-supervised learning on FFHQ to grasp human face distributions, (2) Utilizing the frozen encoder for feature extraction and fine-tuning a regression head on the FBP5500 dataset.

Result: Diff-FBP achieves a PCC of 0.932 on the FBP5500 benchmark, surpassing traditional deep learning and Vision Transformer-based approaches.

Conclusion: Generative model pre-training proves effective for subjective visual tasks, significantly improving feature semantic relevance for facial beauty prediction.

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision task due to
its subjective nature and the subtle, holistic features that influence human
perception. Prevailing methods, often based on deep convolutional networks or
standard Vision Transformers pre-trained on generic object classification
(e.g., ImageNet), struggle to learn feature representations that are truly
aligned with high-level aesthetic assessment. In this paper, we propose a novel
two-stage framework that leverages the power of generative models to create a
superior, domain-specific feature extractor. In the first stage, we pre-train a
Diffusion Transformer on a large-scale, unlabeled facial dataset (FFHQ) through
a self-supervised denoising task. This process forces the model to learn the
fundamental data distribution of human faces, capturing nuanced details and
structural priors essential for aesthetic evaluation. In the second stage, the
pre-trained and frozen encoder of our Diffusion Transformer is used as a
backbone feature extractor, with only a lightweight regression head being
fine-tuned on the target FBP dataset (FBP5500). Our method, termed Diff-FBP,
sets a new state-of-the-art on the FBP5500 benchmark, achieving a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.932, significantly outperforming prior art
based on general-purpose pre-training. Extensive ablation studies validate that
our generative pre-training strategy is the key contributor to this performance
leap, creating feature representations that are more semantically potent for
subjective visual tasks.

*Shuolin Xu,Bingyuan Wang,Zeyu Cai,Fangteng Fu,Yue Ma,Tongyi Lee,Hongchuan Yu,Zeyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MagicAnime dataset and benchmarks were introduced to tackle challenges in generating cartoon animations using multimodal data, addressing the domain gap and scarcity of public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity in animating non-human characters and overcoming the lack of multimodal, annotated cartoon data for animation generation tasks.

Method: Developed the MagicAnime dataset with extensive annotations for multimodal animation tasks, along with benchmarks for comparison and empirical evaluations.

Result: The experiments demonstrated effectiveness in achieving high-quality, controllable cartoon character animation across various tasks, including face and pose-driven animations.

Conclusion: MagicAnime significantly enhances animation generation capabilities by providing a robust dataset and benchmarks, supporting the development of advanced multimodal techniques.

Abstract: Generating high-quality cartoon animations multimodal control is challenging
due to the complexity of non-human characters, stylistically diverse motions
and fine-grained emotions. There is a huge domain gap between real-world videos
and cartoon animation, as cartoon animation is usually abstract and has
exaggerated motion. Meanwhile, public multimodal cartoon data are extremely
scarce due to the difficulty of large-scale automatic annotation processes
compared with real-life scenarios. To bridge this gap, We propose the
MagicAnime dataset, a large-scale, hierarchically annotated, and multimodal
dataset designed to support multiple video generation tasks, along with the
benchmarks it includes. Containing 400k video clips for image-to-video
generation, 50k pairs of video clips and keypoints for whole-body annotation,
12k pairs of video clips for video-to-video face animation, and 2.9k pairs of
video and audio clips for audio-driven face animation. Meanwhile, we also build
a set of multi-modal cartoon animation benchmarks, called MagicAnime-Bench, to
support the comparisons of different methods in the tasks above. Comprehensive
experiments on four tasks, including video-driven face animation, audio-driven
face animation, image-to-video animation, and pose-driven character animation,
validate its effectiveness in supporting high-fidelity, fine-grained, and
controllable generation.

*Alexandru Brateanu,Raul Balmez,Ciprian Orhei,Codruta Ancuti,Cosmin Ancuti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ModalFormer, a multimodal framework for enhancing low-light images using information from nine auxiliary modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light images suffer from noise, loss of detail, and poor contrast, and existing models often ignore contextual information from various modalities.

Method: The approach integrates a Cross-modal Transformer (CM-T) with auxiliary subnetworks. The CM-T uses a novel Cross-modal Multi-headed Self-Attention (CM-MSA) mechanism for effective multimodal feature fusion.

Result: The proposed ModalFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets for low-light image enhancement.

Conclusion: Leveraging multimodal information significantly improves low-light image enhancement capabilities, and ModalFormer provides a robust solution for this challenging task.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a fundamental yet challenging task due
to the presence of noise, loss of detail, and poor contrast in images captured
under insufficient lighting conditions. Recent methods often rely solely on
pixel-level transformations of RGB images, neglecting the rich contextual
information available from multiple visual modalities. In this paper, we
present ModalFormer, the first large-scale multimodal framework for LLIE that
fully exploits nine auxiliary modalities to achieve state-of-the-art
performance. Our model comprises two main components: a Cross-modal Transformer
(CM-T) designed to restore corrupted images while seamlessly integrating
multimodal information, and multiple auxiliary subnetworks dedicated to
multimodal feature reconstruction. Central to the CM-T is our novel Cross-modal
Multi-headed Self-Attention mechanism (CM-MSA), which effectively fuses RGB
data with modality-specific features--including deep feature embeddings,
segmentation information, geometric cues, and color information--to generate
information-rich hybrid attention maps. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate ModalFormer's state-of-the-art performance in
LLIE. Pre-trained models and results are made available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper uses semantic segmentation to analyze the Indian Driving Dataset for autonomous vehicles, achieving a highest Mean Intersection over Union (MIOU) of 0.6496 using five deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles need robust scene understanding for effective functioning, and semantic segmentation is vital for comprehending driving environments, particularly in unstructured terrains like Indian roads.

Method: The paper applies semantic segmentation using five deep learning models (UNET, UNET+RESNET50, DeepLabsV3, PSPNet, SegNet) on the hierarchical Indian Driving Dataset, focusing on the first level and comparing model performance via MIOU.

Result: The highest MIOU of 0.6496 was achieved, highlighting the challenges and opportunities of semantic segmentation in unstructured driving environments using the Indian Driving Dataset.

Conclusion: The research advances the understanding of unstructured Indian driving environments through deep learning semantic segmentation, benchmarking results and addressing unique challenges of such scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are the next revolution in the automobile industry and
they are expected to revolutionize the future of transportation. Understanding
the scenario in which the autonomous vehicle will operate is critical for its
competent functioning. Deep Learning has played a massive role in the progress
that has been made till date. Semantic Segmentation, the process of annotating
every pixel of an image with an object class, is one crucial part of this scene
comprehension using Deep Learning. It is especially useful in Autonomous
Driving Research as it requires comprehension of drivable and non-drivable
areas, roadside objects and the like. In this paper semantic segmentation has
been performed on the Indian Driving Dataset which has been recently compiled
on the urban and rural roads of Bengaluru and Hyderabad. This dataset is more
challenging compared to other datasets like Cityscapes, since it is based on
unstructured driving environments. It has a four level hierarchy and in this
paper segmentation has been performed on the first level. Five different models
have been trained and their performance has been compared using the Mean
Intersection over Union. These are UNET, UNET+RESNET50, DeepLabsV3, PSPNet and
SegNet. The highest MIOU of 0.6496 has been achieved. The paper discusses the
dataset, exploratory data analysis, preparation, implementation of the five
models and studies the performance and compares the results achieved in the
process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VESPA, a multimodal autolabeling pipeline that combines LiDAR and camera data for better 3D pseudolabel generation and scalable scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of manual annotation in autonomous driving, particularly for 3D labels, and the challenges of current LiDAR-based autolabeling methods, such as data sparsity and lack of semantic granularity.

Method: VESPA fuses LiDAR geometric data with camera images using vision-language models (VLMs) for open-vocabulary object labeling and refinement of detection quality in the 3D point cloud domain.

Result: On the Nuscenes dataset, VESPA achieved an AP of 52.95% for object discovery and up to 46.54% for multi-class object detection, showcasing its capability in discovering novel categories and producing high-quality 3D pseudolabels.

Conclusion: VESPA provides a scalable, high-quality 3D autolabeling solution that eliminates the need for ground-truth annotations or HD maps while significantly enhancing 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Data collection for autonomous driving is rapidly accelerating, but manual
annotation, especially for 3D labels, remains a major bottleneck due to its
high cost and labor intensity. Autolabeling has emerged as a scalable
alternative, allowing the generation of labels for point clouds with minimal
human intervention. While LiDAR-based autolabeling methods leverage geometric
information, they struggle with inherent limitations of lidar data, such as
sparsity, occlusions, and incomplete object observations. Furthermore, these
methods typically operate in a class-agnostic manner, offering limited semantic
granularity. To address these challenges, we introduce VESPA, a multimodal
autolabeling pipeline that fuses the geometric precision of LiDAR with the
semantic richness of camera images. Our approach leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) to enable open-vocabulary object labeling and to refine detection
quality directly in the point cloud domain. VESPA supports the discovery of
novel categories and produces high-quality 3D pseudolabels without requiring
ground-truth annotations or HD maps. On Nuscenes dataset, VESPA achieves an AP
of 52.95% for object discovery and up to 46.54% for multiclass object
detection, demonstrating strong performance in scalable 3D scene understanding.
Code will be available upon acceptance.

elements compared to the previous one. (1) An automatic evaluation platform was
enabled for automatic benchmarking; (2) Two tracks were proposed in order to
evaluate algorithms and datasets, respectively; and (3) A new ID card dataset
was shared with Track 1 teams to serve as the baseline dataset for the training
and optimisation. The Hochschule Darmstadt, Fraunhofer-IGD, and Facephi company
jointly organised this challenge. 20 teams were registered, and 74 submitted
models were evaluated. For Track 1, the "Dragons" team reached first place with
an Average Ranking and Equal Error rate (EER) of AV-Rank of 40.48% and 11.44%
EER, respectively. For the more challenging approach in Track 2, the "Incode"
team reached the best results with an AV-Rank of 14.76% and 6.36% EER,
improving on the results of the first edition of 74.30% and 21.87% EER,

Conclusion: This paper concludes that the proposed ISL translation system is effective, reliable, and capable of enhancing communication for deaf and mute communities by bridging significant technological gaps through a robust ML-based approach.

Abstract: Gestural language is used by deaf & mute communities to communicate through
hand gestures & body movements that rely on visual-spatial patterns known as
sign languages. Sign languages, which rely on visual-spatial patterns of hand
gestures & body movements, are the primary mode of communication for deaf &
mute communities worldwide. Effective communication is fundamental to human
interaction, yet individuals in these communities often face significant
barriers due to a scarcity of skilled interpreters & accessible translation
technologies. This research specifically addresses these challenges within the
Indian context by focusing on Indian Sign Language (ISL). By leveraging machine
learning, this study aims to bridge the critical communication gap for the deaf
& hard-of-hearing population in India, where technological solutions for ISL
are less developed compared to other global sign languages. We propose a
robust, real-time ISL detection & translation system built upon a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). Our model is trained on a comprehensive ISL dataset &
demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a classification accuracy of
99.95%. This high precision underscores the model's capability to discern the
nuanced visual features of different signs. The system's effectiveness is
rigorously evaluated using key performance metrics, including accuracy, F1
score, precision & recall, ensuring its reliability for real-world
applications. For real-time implementation, the framework integrates MediaPipe
for precise hand tracking & motion detection, enabling seamless translation of
dynamic gestures. This paper provides a detailed account of the model's
architecture, the data preprocessing pipeline & the classification methodology.
The research elaborates the model architecture, preprocessing & classification

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve prediction of individual alertness for work through biometric data, overcoming challenges in dataset creation and utilizing advancements in AI foundational models.

Method: Examines deep learning techniques and self-supervised foundational AI models to estimate alertness using iris images.

Result: Demonstrates that foundational models can effectively predict alertness despite challenges in large-scale dataset creation.

Conclusion: Biometric devices combined with advanced AI approaches provide a feasible way to predict fitness for work by leveraging generalization capabilities of self-supervised models.

Abstract: Biometric capture devices have been utilised to estimate a person's alertness
through near-infrared iris images, expanding their use beyond just biometric
recognition. However, capturing a substantial number of corresponding images
related to alcohol consumption, drug use, and sleep deprivation to create a
dataset for training an AI model presents a significant challenge. Typically, a
large quantity of images is required to effectively implement a deep learning
approach. Currently, training downstream models with a huge number of images
based on foundational models provides a real opportunity to enhance this area,
thanks to the generalisation capabilities of self-supervised models. This work
examines the application of deep learning and foundational models in predicting
fitness for duty, which is defined as the subject condition related to
determining the alertness for work.

*Dinh Nam Pham,Eleftherios Avramidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the contribution of distinct facial regions (eyes, mouth, full face) using deep learning models for automatic sign language recognition (ASLR), finding that the mouth is the most important feature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial features are crucial in sign language communication, but their role in ASLR has not been systematically studied.

Method: The study uses two deep learning models—a CNN-based model and a transformer-based model—to evaluate distinct facial regions on an isolated signs dataset through quantitative performance and saliency map analysis.

Result: The mouth is identified as the most important facial region, significantly improving recognition accuracy.

Conclusion: Incorporating facial features, particularly the mouth region, is essential for enhancing automatic sign language recognition.

Abstract: Non-manual facial features play a crucial role in sign language
communication, yet their importance in automatic sign language recognition
(ASLR) remains underexplored. While prior studies have shown that incorporating
facial features can improve recognition, related work often relies on
hand-crafted feature extraction and fails to go beyond the comparison of manual
features versus the combination of manual and facial features. In this work, we
systematically investigate the contribution of distinct facial regionseyes,
mouth, and full faceusing two different deep learning models (a CNN-based model
and a transformer-based model) trained on an SLR dataset of isolated signs with
randomly selected classes. Through quantitative performance and qualitative
saliency map evaluation, we reveal that the mouth is the most important
non-manual facial feature, significantly improving accuracy. Our findings
highlight the necessity of incorporating facial features in ASLR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an improved method for talking head synthesis using a joint 3D face reconstruction and talking head synthesis model, resulting in better visual quality and enhanced lip-syncing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve the quality of talking head synthesis and ensure more accurate lip-syncing by overcoming the limitations of previous methods relying on 2D landmarks or pretrained models.

Method: A novel approach that jointly learns a 3D face reconstruction model and a talking head synthesis model, utilizing a FACS-based blendshape representation optimized for talking head synthesis, and a new lip-sync pipeline to decouple contours and reduce flickering.

Result: The proposed method achieves higher-quality generated faces and enables precise, audio-driven lip-syncing with reduced artifacts like flickering.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the effectiveness of revisiting 3DMM for improving talking head synthesis, showcasing advantages in both visual quality and lip-sync capability by leveraging a joint learning approach and innovative lip-sync pipeline.

Abstract: In this work, we revisit the effectiveness of 3DMM for talking head synthesis
by jointly learning a 3D face reconstruction model and a talking head synthesis
model. This enables us to obtain a FACS-based blendshape representation of
facial expressions that is optimized for talking head synthesis. This contrasts
with previous methods that either fit 3DMM parameters to 2D landmarks or rely
on pretrained face reconstruction models. Not only does our approach increase
the quality of the generated face, but it also allows us to take advantage of
the blendshape representation to modify just the mouth region for the purpose
of audio-based lip-sync. To this end, we propose a novel lip-sync pipeline
that, unlike previous methods, decouples the original chin contour from the
lip-synced chin contour, and reduces flickering near the mouth.

Conclusion: SparseVAR is a plug-and-play framework offering significant computational efficiency improvements while maintaining high-quality image outputs.

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling, based on the next-scale prediction paradigm,
exhibits notable advantages in image quality and model scalability over
traditional autoregressive and diffusion models. It generates images by
progressively refining resolution across multiple stages. However, the
computational overhead in high-resolution stages remains a critical challenge
due to the substantial number of tokens involved. In this paper, we introduce
SparseVAR, a plug-and-play acceleration framework for next-scale prediction
that dynamically excludes low-frequency tokens during inference without
requiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation
that tokens in low-frequency regions have a negligible impact on image quality
in high-resolution stages and exhibit strong similarity with neighboring
tokens. Additionally, we observe that different blocks in the next-scale
prediction model focus on distinct regions, with some concentrating on
high-frequency areas. SparseVAR leverages these insights by employing
lightweight MSE-based metrics to identify low-frequency tokens while preserving
the fidelity of excluded regions through a small set of uniformly sampled
anchor tokens. By significantly reducing the computational cost while
maintaining high image generation quality, SparseVAR achieves notable
acceleration in both HART and Infinity. Specifically, SparseVAR achieves up to
a 2 times speedup with minimal quality degradation in Infinity-2B.

*Zhecheng Li,Guoxian Song,Yiwei Wang,Zhen Xiong,Junsong Yuan,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces $A^2R^2$, a framework to enhance Img2LaTeX conversion using visual reasoning and attention-guided refinement, outperforming baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of inaccurate LaTeX predictions by vision-language models (VLMs), which struggle with fine-grained visual elements.

Method: The $A^2R^2$ framework integrates attention localization and iterative refinement in a visual reasoning structure to enable self-correction by VLMs. A new dataset, Img2LaTex-Hard-1K, was created for rigorous evaluation.

Result: The proposed framework achieves strong performance improvements in six evaluation metrics, with increased inference rounds further boosting results. Experimental validation and human assessments confirm its effectiveness.

Conclusion: $A^2R^2$ effectively enhances Img2LaTeX conversion by addressing fine-grained visual challenges and demonstrates scalability in test-time scenarios.

Abstract: Img2LaTeX is a practically significant task that involves converting
mathematical expressions or tabular data from images into LaTeX code. In recent
years, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a variety of visual understanding tasks, owing to their generalization
capabilities. While some studies have explored the use of VLMs for the
Img2LaTeX task, their performance often falls short of expectations.
Empirically, VLMs sometimes struggle with fine-grained visual elements, leading
to inaccurate LaTeX predictions. To address this challenge, we propose
$A^2R^2$: Advancing Img2LaTeX Conversion via Visual Reasoning with
Attention-Guided Refinement, a framework that effectively integrates attention
localization and iterative refinement within a visual reasoning framework,
enabling VLMs to perform self-correction and progressively improve prediction
quality. For effective evaluation, we introduce a new dataset,
Img2LaTex-Hard-1K, consisting of 1,100 carefully curated and challenging
examples designed to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of VLMs within this
task domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) $A^2R^2$
significantly improves model performance across six evaluation metrics spanning
both textual and visual levels, consistently outperforming other baseline
methods; (2) Increasing the number of inference rounds yields notable
performance gains, underscoring the potential of $A^2R^2$ in test-time scaling
scenarios; (3) Ablation studies and human evaluations validate the practical
effectiveness of our approach, as well as the strong synergy among its core
components during inference.

### [244] [Priority-Aware Pathological Hierarchy Training for Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20469)
*Sungrae Hong,Kyungeun Kim,Juhyeon Kim,Sol Lee,Jisu Shin,Chanjae Song,Mun Yong Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method to improve Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) for clinical diagnostics by addressing class priority issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address a gap in MIL applications for clinical settings, where existing methods fail to account for the priority among pathological symptoms and diagnostic classes.

Method: The proposed method incorporates two hierarchical structures: vertical inter-hierarchy and horizontal intra-hierarchy, aligning MIL predictions accordingly and reusing features to emphasize clinically important classes.

Result: Experiments on real-world patient data show improved diagnosis accuracy and prioritization of critical symptoms, reducing misdiagnosis.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that their approach enhances MIL's clinical application through priority-aware diagnosis and shows efficacy through qualitative and quantitative analysis.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is increasingly being used as a support tool
within clinical settings for pathological diagnosis decisions, achieving high
performance and removing the annotation burden. However, existing approaches
for clinical MIL tasks have not adequately addressed the priority issues that
exist in relation to pathological symptoms and diagnostic classes, causing MIL
models to ignore priority among classes. To overcome this clinical limitation
of MIL, we propose a new method that addresses priority issues using two
hierarchies: vertical inter-hierarchy and horizontal intra-hierarchy. The
proposed method aligns MIL predictions across each hierarchical level and
employs an implicit feature re-usability during training to facilitate
clinically more serious classes within the same level. Experiments with
real-world patient data show that the proposed method effectively reduces
misdiagnosis and prioritizes more important symptoms in multiclass scenarios.
Further analysis verifies the efficacy of the proposed components and
qualitatively confirms the MIL predictions against challenging cases with
multiple symptoms.

### [245] [Automated 3D-GS Registration and Fusion via Skeleton Alignment and Gaussian-Adaptive Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20480)
*Shiyang Liu,Dianyi Yang,Yu Gao,Bohan Ren,Yi Yang,Mengyin Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated method for aligning and fusing multiple 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) scene maps, without manual intervention, while improving registration accuracy and fusion quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from limitations in existing methods that require manual intervention for reference map selection and often degrade rendering quality during fusion due to hard-threshold filtering of 3D-GS primitives.

Method: The method involves extracting geometric skeletons across scenes, applying ellipsoid-aware convolution for 3D-GS attribute capturing, and using a multi-factor Gaussian fusion strategy to enhance both registration and fusion processes.

Result: The approach achieved a 41.9% reduction in RRE for registration, improving pose estimation accuracy in complex scenes, and enhanced fusion quality by increasing PSNR by 10.11 dB, preserving structural details.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves 3D scene alignment and reconstruction fidelity, offering a robust framework suitable for applications like robotic perception and autonomous navigation.

Abstract: In recent years, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS)-based scene representation
demonstrates significant potential in real-time rendering and training
efficiency. However, most existing methods primarily focus on single-map
reconstruction, while the registration and fusion of multiple 3D-GS sub-maps
remain underexplored. Existing methods typically rely on manual intervention to
select a reference sub-map as a template and use point cloud matching for
registration. Moreover, hard-threshold filtering of 3D-GS primitives often
degrades rendering quality after fusion. In this paper, we present a novel
approach for automated 3D-GS sub-map alignment and fusion, eliminating the need
for manual intervention while enhancing registration accuracy and fusion
quality. First, we extract geometric skeletons across multiple scenes and
leverage ellipsoid-aware convolution to capture 3D-GS attributes, facilitating
robust scene registration. Second, we introduce a multi-factor Gaussian fusion
strategy to mitigate the scene element loss caused by rigid thresholding.
Experiments on the ScanNet-GSReg and our Coord datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in registration and fusion. For
registration, it achieves a 41.9\% reduction in RRE on complex scenes, ensuring
more precise pose estimation. For fusion, it improves PSNR by 10.11 dB,
highlighting superior structural preservation. These results confirm its
ability to enhance scene alignment and reconstruction fidelity, ensuring more
consistent and accurate 3D scene representation for robotic perception and
autonomous navigation.

### [246] [An Improved YOLOv8 Approach for Small Target Detection of Rice Spikelet Flowering in Field Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20506)
*Beizhang Chen,Jinming Liang,Zheng Xiong,Ming Pan,Xiangbao Meng,Qingshan Lin,Qun Ma,Yingping Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper tackles the challenge of automating rice flowering detection using an improved YOLOv8 model, achieving enhanced accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely detection of rice flowering is essential to boost pollination efficiency and yields in hybrid rice production, but field complexities and the nature of rice spikelets pose difficulties for automation.

Method: The study improves YOLOv8 by integrating a Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) for feature fusion, adding a p2 small-object detection head, and constructing a dedicated dataset with high-resolution imagery and augmentation techniques.

Result: The improved YOLOv8s-p2 model achieved an mAP@0.5 of 65.9%, precision of 67.6%, recall of 61.5%, and F1-score of 64.41%, showing significant improvement over the baseline YOLOv8.

Conclusion: The improved YOLOv8s-p2 model provides an accurate and fast solution for automated rice flowering detection, supporting its usability in real-world hybrid rice seed production monitoring.

Abstract: Accurately detecting rice flowering time is crucial for timely pollination in
hybrid rice seed production. This not only enhances pollination efficiency but
also ensures higher yields. However, due to the complexity of field
environments and the characteristics of rice spikelets, such as their small
size and short flowering period, automated and precise recognition remains
challenging. To address this, this study proposes a rice spikelet flowering
recognition method based on an improved YOLOv8 object detection model. First, a
Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) replaces the original PANet
structure to enhance feature fusion and improve multi-scale feature
utilization. Second, to boost small object detection, a p2 small-object
detection head is added, using finer feature mapping to reduce feature loss
commonly seen in detecting small targets. Given the lack of publicly available
datasets for rice spikelet flowering in field conditions, a high-resolution RGB
camera and data augmentation techniques are used to construct a dedicated
dataset, providing reliable support for model training and testing.
Experimental results show that the improved YOLOv8s-p2 model achieves an
mAP@0.5 of 65.9%, precision of 67.6%, recall of 61.5%, and F1-score of 64.41%,
representing improvements of 3.10%, 8.40%, 10.80%, and 9.79%, respectively,
over the baseline YOLOv8. The model also runs at 69 f/s on the test set,
meeting practical application requirements. Overall, the improved YOLOv8s-p2
offers high accuracy and speed, providing an effective solution for automated
monitoring in hybrid rice seed production.

### [247] [Investigating the Effect of Spatial Context on Multi-Task Sea Ice Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20507)
*Behzad Vahedi,Rafael Pires de Lima,Sepideh Jalayer,Walter N. Meier,Andrew P. Barrett,Morteza Karimzadeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines how spatial context and receptive field sizes influence deep learning segmentation performance for sea ice properties, using multi-scale approaches and inputs from Sentinel-1 SAR and AMSR2 data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying optimal spatial context for deep learning-based sea ice segmentation tasks, which is underexplored, especially in multi-task settings.

Method: Implemented Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling with varying atrous rates to control receptive field size and capture multi-scale spatial context. Examined interactions between spatial contexts and input features from Sentinel-1 SAR and AMSR2 data.

Result: Smaller receptive fields performed well for high-resolution data, medium fields suited stage of development segmentation, and large fields were less effective. Combining SAR and AMSR2 data improved performance across tasks, emphasizing AMSR2 lower-resolution channels' value.

Conclusion: Appropriate selection of spatial context and resolution is critical for segmentation accuracy in sea ice mapping. The study provides a systematic analysis to optimize geospatial deep learning models for varied observational data and task requirements.

Abstract: Capturing spatial context at multiple scales is crucial for deep
learning-based sea ice segmentation. However, the optimal specification of
spatial context based on observation resolution and task characteristics
remains underexplored. This study investigates the impact of spatial context on
the segmentation of sea ice concentration, stage of development, and floe size
using a multi-task segmentation model. We implement Atrous Spatial Pyramid
Pooling with varying atrous rates to systematically control the receptive field
size of convolutional operations, and to capture multi-scale contextual
information. We explore the interactions between spatial context and feature
resolution for different sea ice properties and examine how spatial context
influences segmentation performance across different input feature combinations
from Sentinel-1 SAR and Advanced Microwave Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) for multi-task
mapping. Using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, we visualize how
atrous rates influence model decisions. Our findings indicate that smaller
receptive fields excel for high-resolution Sentinel-1 data, while medium
receptive fields yield better performances for stage of development
segmentation and larger receptive fields often lead to diminished performances.
The fusion of SAR and AMSR2 enhances segmentation across all tasks. We
highlight the value of lower-resolution 18.7 and 36.5 GHz AMSR2 channels in sea
ice mapping. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate
spatial context based on observation resolution and target properties in sea
ice mapping. By systematically analyzing receptive field effects in a
multi-task setting, our study provides insights for optimizing deep learning
models in geospatial applications.

### [248] [Beyond Class Tokens: LLM-guided Dominant Property Mining for Few-shot Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20511)
*Wei Zhuo,Runjie Luo,Wufeng Xue,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces BCT-CLIP, a new method for Few-Shot Learning (FSL), which improves novel class recognition by leveraging dominating properties through contrastive learning and textual prior knowledge from large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot learning struggles with generalizing to novel classes due to limited data. Existing CLIP-like methods enhance discovery by utilizing textual class names but lack in preserving visual diversity, which hinders discrimination for novel classes.

Method: The paper proposes BCT-CLIP, which employs dominating property exploration via contrastive learning. This involves a multi-property generator with patch-aware cross-attentions, a retrieval procedure using LLMs with clustering-based pruning, and a new contrastive learning strategy.

Result: The method showed superior performance across 11 widely used datasets, demonstrating effective class-specific representation and improved classification in few-shot settings.

Conclusion: BCT-CLIP advances Few-Shot Learning by enhancing visual diversity in class representation through dominating properties, overcoming limitations of traditional CLIP-like methods.

Abstract: Few-shot Learning (FSL), which endeavors to develop the generalization
ability for recognizing novel classes using only a few images, faces
significant challenges due to data scarcity. Recent CLIP-like methods based on
contrastive language-image pertaining mitigate the issue by leveraging textual
representation of the class name for unseen image discovery. Despite the
achieved success, simply aligning visual representations to class name
embeddings would compromise the visual diversity for novel class
discrimination. To this end, we proposed a novel Few-Shot Learning (FSL) method
(BCT-CLIP) that explores \textbf{dominating properties} via contrastive
learning beyond simply using class tokens. Through leveraging LLM-based prior
knowledge, our method pushes forward FSL with comprehensive structural image
representations, including both global category representation and the
patch-aware property embeddings. In particular, we presented a novel
multi-property generator (MPG) with patch-aware cross-attentions to generate
multiple visual property tokens, a Large-Language Model (LLM)-assistant
retrieval procedure with clustering-based pruning to obtain dominating property
descriptions, and a new contrastive learning strategy for property-token
learning. The superior performances on the 11 widely used datasets demonstrate
that our investigation of dominating properties advances discriminative
class-specific representation learning and few-shot classification.

*Haiyang Bai,Jiaqi Zhu,Songru Jiang,Wei Huang,Tao Lu,Yuanqi Li,Jie Guo,Runze Fu,Yanwen Guo,Lijun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 3D Gaussian splatting framework for outdoor relighting, enabling realistic shading and dynamic shadow effects through intrinsic image decomposition and innovative techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current outdoor relighting techniques struggle with compressing global illumination into single latent vectors, limiting dynamic shading and shadow realism.

Method: The approach includes: (1) residual-based sunlight visibility extraction, (2) region-based supervision with structural consistency loss, and (3) ray-tracing for realistic shadow simulation.

Result: Extensive tests show that the framework achieves competitive visual fidelity and superior dynamic shading and shadow capabilities compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully advances outdoor relighting by enabling diverse and physically realistic illumination and shadow effects.

Abstract: We propose a 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework for outdoor relighting
that leverages intrinsic image decomposition to precisely integrate sunlight,
sky radiance, and indirect lighting from unconstrained photo collections.
Unlike prior methods that compress the per-image global illumination into a
single latent vector, our approach enables simultaneously diverse shading
manipulation and the generation of dynamic shadow effects. This is achieved
through three key innovations: (1) a residual-based sun visibility extraction
method to accurately separate direct sunlight effects, (2) a region-based
supervision framework with a structural consistency loss for physically
interpretable and coherent illumination decomposition, and (3) a
ray-tracing-based technique for realistic shadow simulation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework synthesizes novel views with
competitive fidelity against state-of-the-art relighting solutions and produces
more natural and multifaceted illumination and shadow effects.

*Yili Li,Gang Xiong,Gaopeng Gou,Xiangyan Qu,Jiamin Zhuang,Zhen Li,Junzheng Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces T2VParser, a method to achieve partial and adaptive alignment between text and video representations, addressing misalignment issues in typical video-text retrieval tasks. It uses shared learnable tokens for cross-modal semantic decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the misalignment issue in video-text retrieval caused by the richer information in videos than what textual descriptions can capture.

Method: Proposes T2VParser, which uses Adaptive Decomposition Tokens for extracting multiview semantic representations, enabling precise and adaptive alignment between text and video.

Result: T2VParser demonstrates effective partial alignment through cross-modal content decomposition, validated with experimental results.

Conclusion: The approach combines pretrained model knowledge with advanced alignment techniques, achieving improved accuracy and adaptability in text-to-video retrieval.

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval essentially aims to train models to align visual
content with textual descriptions accurately. Due to the impressive general
multimodal knowledge demonstrated by image-text pretrained models such as CLIP,
existing work has primarily focused on extending CLIP knowledge for video-text
tasks. However, videos typically contain richer information than images. In
current video-text datasets, textual descriptions can only reflect a portion of
the video content, leading to partial misalignment in video-text matching.
Therefore, directly aligning text representations with video representations
can result in incorrect supervision, ignoring the inequivalence of information.
In this work, we propose T2VParser to extract multiview semantic
representations from text and video, achieving adaptive semantic alignment
rather than aligning the entire representation. To extract corresponding
representations from different modalities, we introduce Adaptive Decomposition
Tokens, which consist of a set of learnable tokens shared across modalities.
The goal of T2VParser is to emphasize precise alignment between text and video
while retaining the knowledge of pretrained models. Experimental results
demonstrate that T2VParser achieves accurate partial alignment through
effective cross-modal content decomposition. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgroBench, a VLM benchmark for agricultural tasks, covering a wide array of topics such as crops and diseases, highlighting areas where VLMs need improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance automated agricultural tasks like disease identification and bridge gaps in human-machine interaction using vision-language models (VLMs).

Method: Developed AgroBench, a VLM evaluation benchmark annotated by expert agronomists, covering seven agricultural topics with diverse categories such as crops and diseases.

Result: The evaluation demonstrates that VLMs struggle with fine-grained tasks like weed identification, often performing close to random.

Conclusion: AgroBench establishes a foundation for assessing and improving VLM capabilities in agriculture by identifying errors and suggesting future development directions.

Abstract: Precise automated understanding of agricultural tasks such as disease
identification is essential for sustainable crop production. Recent advances in
vision-language models (VLMs) are expected to further expand the range of
agricultural tasks by facilitating human-model interaction through easy,
text-based communication. Here, we introduce AgroBench (Agronomist AI
Benchmark), a benchmark for evaluating VLM models across seven agricultural
topics, covering key areas in agricultural engineering and relevant to
real-world farming. Unlike recent agricultural VLM benchmarks, AgroBench is
annotated by expert agronomists. Our AgroBench covers a state-of-the-art range
of categories, including 203 crop categories and 682 disease categories, to
thoroughly evaluate VLM capabilities. In our evaluation on AgroBench, we reveal
that VLMs have room for improvement in fine-grained identification tasks.
Notably, in weed identification, most open-source VLMs perform close to random.
With our wide range of topics and expert-annotated categories, we analyze the
types of errors made by VLMs and suggest potential pathways for future VLM
development. Our dataset and code are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SpatialVTS, a new method for improving spatial reasoning by enhancing visual and textual thinking phases. Manual dataset corrections also bolster model training effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance challenges vision language models (VLMs) face in spatial reasoning tasks, which are critical for VQA and robotics.

Method: SpatialVTS uses a two-phase approach: spatial visual thinking generates location-specific tokens for reasoning, while spatial textual thinking incrementally infers answers using visual cues and dialogues. Dataset corrections further support training.

Result: The SpatialVTS model showed a significant average performance improvement across various spatial understanding tasks without extra data such as masks or depth.

Conclusion: SpatialVTS effectively enhances spatial reasoning capabilities in VLMs, suggesting its applicability to tasks requiring strong reasoning abilities.

Abstract: The spatial reasoning task aims to reason about the spatial relationships in
2D and 3D space, which is a fundamental capability for Visual Question
Answering (VQA) and robotics. Although vision language models (VLMs) have
developed rapidly in recent years, they are still struggling with the spatial
reasoning task. In this paper, we introduce a method that can enhance Spatial
reasoning through Visual and Textual thinking Simultaneously (SpatialVTS). In
the spatial visual thinking phase, our model is trained to generate
location-related specific tokens of essential targets automatically. Not only
are the objects mentioned in the problem addressed, but also the potential
objects related to the reasoning are considered. During the spatial textual
thinking phase, Our model conducts long-term thinking based on visual cues and
dialogues, gradually inferring the answers to spatial reasoning problems. To
effectively support the model's training, we perform manual corrections to the
existing spatial reasoning dataset, eliminating numerous incorrect labels
resulting from automatic annotation, restructuring the data input format to
enhance generalization ability, and developing thinking processes with logical
reasoning details. Without introducing additional information (such as masks or
depth), our model's overall average level in several spatial understanding
tasks has significantly improved compared with other models.

Motivation: The motivation is to enable accurate, real-time, and cost-effective classification of green lentils to improve sorting efficiency.

Method: The system uses a two-stage YOLOv8-based pipeline for grain detection and classification, coupled with a pneumatic ejection and Arduino-based control system.

Result: The system achieves 87.2% grain separation accuracy with a processing rate of 8 grams per minute at a conveyor speed of 59 mm/s.

Conclusion: The prototype demonstrates the feasibility of using machine vision in grain sorting and serves as a modular base for future improvements.

Abstract: This paper presents the design, development, and evaluation of a dynamic
grain classification system for green lentils (Lens Culinaris), which leverages
computer vision and pneumatic ejection. The system integrates a YOLOv8-based
detection model that identifies and locates grains on a conveyor belt, together
with a second YOLOv8-based classification model that categorises grains into
six classes: Good, Yellow, Broken, Peeled, Dotted, and Reject. This two-stage
YOLOv8 pipeline enables accurate, real-time, multi-class categorisation of
lentils, implemented on a low-cost, modular hardware platform. The pneumatic
ejection mechanism separates defective grains, while an Arduino-based control
system coordinates real-time interaction between the vision system and
mechanical components. The system operates effectively at a conveyor speed of
59 mm/s, achieving a grain separation accuracy of 87.2%. Despite a limited
processing rate of 8 grams per minute, the prototype demonstrates the potential
of machine vision for grain sorting and provides a modular foundation for
future enhancements.

*Chieh-Yun Chen,Min Shi,Gong Zhang,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2I-Copilot introduces a training-free multi-agent system for simplifying prompt engineering in text-to-image generation, improving quality and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models rely heavily on well-crafted prompts, causing challenges in usability and generalization due to sensitivities in phrasing.

Method: The paper presents T2I-Copilot, a multi-agent system consisting of Input Interpreter, Generation Engine, and Quality Evaluator that works autonomously or collaboratively with humans.

Result: T2I-Copilot surpasses multiple open-source models and some commercial models in visual quality assessment (VQA) score, while operating at a lower cost.

Conclusion: T2I-Copilot improves text-to-image generation quality and usability, offering advances in prompt engineering without requiring additional training for generalization.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation
but remain highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, often requiring users to
repeatedly refine prompts multiple times without clear feedback. While
techniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings,
denoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited
controllability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the
generalization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free
multi-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large
Language Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative
refinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while
enhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct
generation. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input
Interpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates
a standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate
model from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual
prompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses
aesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for
potential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also
supporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control. On
GenAI-Bench, using open-source generation models, T2I-Copilot achieves a VQA
score comparable to commercial models RecraftV3 and Imagen 3, surpasses
FLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at only 16.59% of its cost, and outperforms FLUX.1-dev and
SD 3.5 Large by 9.11% and 6.36%. Code will be released at:

### [255] [Annotation-Free Human Sketch Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20548)
*Lan Yang,Kaiyue Pang,Honggang Zhang,Yi-Zhe Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for sketch quality assessment using feature magnitude as a quality metric, which aligns well with human perception without needing specific annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack an effective way to assess sketch quality quantitatively, and traditional human-derived metrics are inefficient.

Method: The Geometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL) is proposed, treating feature magnitude and recognisability learning as dual tasks optimized under cross-entropy loss.

Result: GACL achieves alignment between its metric and human perception in a large-scale study of 160,000 trials and supports applications in sketches and natural image quality assessments.

Conclusion: GACL is a versatile tool for sketch and image quality assessment, enabling practical applications and addressing noisy label problems while being architecture-agnostic.

Abstract: As lovely as bunnies are, your sketched version would probably not do them
justice (Fig.~\ref{fig:intro}). This paper recognises this very problem and
studies sketch quality assessment for the first time -- letting you find these
badly drawn ones. Our key discovery lies in exploiting the magnitude ($L_2$
norm) of a sketch feature as a quantitative quality metric. We propose
Geometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL), a generic method that makes
feature-magnitude-as-quality-metric possible and importantly does it without
the need for specific quality annotations from humans. GACL sees feature
magnitude and recognisability learning as a dual task, which can be
simultaneously optimised under a neat cross-entropy classification loss with
theoretic guarantee. This gives GACL a nice geometric interpretation (the
better the quality, the easier the recognition), and makes it agnostic to both
network architecture changes and the underlying sketch representation. Through
a large scale human study of 160,000 \doublecheck{trials}, we confirm the
agreement between our GACL-induced metric and human quality perception. We
further demonstrate how such a quality assessment capability can for the first
time enable three practical sketch applications. Interestingly, we show GACL
not only works on abstract visual representations such as sketch but also
extends well to natural images on the problem of image quality assessment
(IQA). Last but not least, we spell out the general properties of GACL as
general-purpose data re-weighting strategy and demonstrate its applications in
vertical problems such as noisy label cleansing. Code will be made publicly

### [256] [FED-PsyAU: Privacy-Preserving Micro-Expression Recognition via Psychological AU Coordination and Dynamic Facial Motion Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20557)
*Jingting Li,Yu Qian,Lin Zhao,Su-Jing Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of micro-expression recognition (MER) by proposing a framework combining psychological insights, motion analytics, and federated learning to enhance performance and preserve privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the challenges of recognizing micro-expressions, which involve subtle, localized facial movements and are hindered by small data samples and privacy constraints in real-world applications.

Method: The authors propose the FED-PsyAU framework, which integrates a psychological study on facial action units, a DPK-GAT network for motion feature learning, and a federated learning model to work across clients without data sharing.

Result: Experiments on standard micro-expression databases show that the proposed approach improves MER performance while maintaining data privacy and addressing sample size limitations.

Conclusion: The FED-PsyAU framework successfully enhances micro-expression recognition by combining structured psychological insights, advanced motion feature modeling, and privacy-preserving federated learning.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, low-intensity, often localized facial
expressions. They could reveal genuine emotions individuals may attempt to
conceal, valuable in contexts like criminal interrogation and psychological
counseling. However, ME recognition (MER) faces challenges, such as small
sample sizes and subtle features, which hinder efficient modeling.
Additionally, real-world applications encounter ME data privacy issues, leaving
the task of enhancing recognition across settings under privacy constraints
largely unexplored. To address these issues, we propose a FED-PsyAU research
framework. We begin with a psychological study on the coordination of upper and
lower facial action units (AUs) to provide structured prior knowledge of facial
muscle dynamics. We then develop a DPK-GAT network that combines these
psychological priors with statistical AU patterns, enabling hierarchical
learning of facial motion features from regional to global levels, effectively
enhancing MER performance. Additionally, our federated learning framework
advances MER capabilities across multiple clients without data sharing,
preserving privacy and alleviating the limited-sample issue for each client.
Extensive experiments on commonly-used ME databases demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

### [257] [MemoryTalker: Personalized Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation via Audio-Guided Stylization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20562)
*Hyung Kyu Kim,Sangmin Lee,Hak Gu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MemoryTalker, a system for speech-driven 3D facial animations that synthesizes realistic and personalized motion using only audio input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for generating 3D facial animations rely on priors like speaker-specific labels or additional 3D facial meshes, limiting their ability to capture personal speaking styles and practical application.

Method: MemoryTalker uses a two-stage training approach: Stage 1 involves memorizing general motion, and Stage 2 focuses on personalized facial motion synthesis with audio-driven speaking style features.

Result: MemoryTalker successfully produces accurate and personalized 3D facial animations without relying on external priors, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative assessments.

Conclusion: The framework enhances usability in applications where speaker-specific animations are needed by eliminating dependency on external prior information.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to synthesize realistic facial motion
sequences from given audio, matching the speaker's speaking style. However,
previous works often require priors such as class labels of a speaker or
additional 3D facial meshes at inference, which makes them fail to reflect the
speaking style and limits their practical use. To address these issues, we
propose MemoryTalker which enables realistic and accurate 3D facial motion
synthesis by reflecting speaking style only with audio input to maximize
usability in applications. Our framework consists of two training stages:
1-stage is storing and retrieving general motion (i.e., Memorizing), and
2-stage is to perform the personalized facial motion synthesis (i.e.,
Animating) with the motion memory stylized by the audio-driven speaking style
feature. In this second stage, our model learns about which facial motion types
should be emphasized for a particular piece of audio. As a result, our
MemoryTalker can generate a reliable personalized facial animation without
additional prior information. With quantitative and qualitative evaluations, as
well as user study, we show the effectiveness of our model and its performance
enhancement for personalized facial animation over state-of-the-art methods.

### [258] [Learning Phonetic Context-Dependent Viseme for Enhancing Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20568)
*Hyung Kyu Kim,Hak Gu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper provides a new approach to generating smoother and more natural speech-driven 3D facial animation using a phonetic context-aware loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of frame-wise methods in 3D facial animation, which fail to capture natural motion continuity due to lacking consideration for coarticulation.

Method: The authors introduce a phonetic context-aware loss that models the influence of phonetic context on viseme transitions using a viseme coarticulation weight mechanism.

Result: Replacing conventional reconstruction loss with the proposed approach improves both quantitative measures and visual perceptual quality.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling phonetic context-dependent visemes is critical for creating natural speech-driven 3D facial animations.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic facial movements
synchronized with audio. Traditional methods primarily minimize reconstruction
loss by aligning each frame with ground-truth. However, this frame-wise
approach often fails to capture the continuity of facial motion, leading to
jittery and unnatural outputs due to coarticulation. To address this, we
propose a novel phonetic context-aware loss, which explicitly models the
influence of phonetic context on viseme transitions. By incorporating a viseme
coarticulation weight, we assign adaptive importance to facial movements based
on their dynamic changes over time, ensuring smoother and perceptually
consistent animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that replacing the
conventional reconstruction loss with ours improves both quantitative metrics
and visual quality. It highlights the importance of explicitly modeling
phonetic context-dependent visemes in synthesizing natural speech-driven 3D
facial animation. Project page: https://cau-irislab.github.io/interspeech25/

*Yanyin Guo,Runxuan An,Junwei Li,Zhiyuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LSFDNet, a novel single-stage image fusion detection algorithm using both short-wave and long-wave infrared data for ship detection, addressing challenges like varying lighting and fog conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods relying on single-modal visible or infrared images are inadequate for ship detection in complex environments with lighting variability or fog.

Method: The LSFDNet algorithm employs feature interaction between image fusion and object detection networks, with a Multi-Level Cross-Fusion (MLCF) module and Object Enhancement (OE) loss function to enhance feature saliency and detection performance. A new dataset, NSLSR, was also created for training.

Result: The proposed LSFDNet demonstrated superior detection performance on two datasets, producing semantically rich fused images and visual improvements.

Conclusion: LSFDNet successfully addresses limitations of single-modal detection methods, offering improved robustness and detection in challenging maritime conditions through innovative fusion techniques and feature enhancement.

Abstract: Traditional ship detection methods primarily rely on single-modal approaches,
such as visible or infrared images, which limit their application in complex
scenarios involving varying lighting conditions and heavy fog. To address this
issue, we explore the advantages of short-wave infrared (SWIR) and long-wave
infrared (LWIR) in ship detection and propose a novel single-stage image fusion
detection algorithm called LSFDNet. This algorithm leverages feature
interaction between the image fusion and object detection subtask networks,
achieving remarkable detection performance and generating visually impressive
fused images. To further improve the saliency of objects in the fused images
and improve the performance of the downstream detection task, we introduce the
Multi-Level Cross-Fusion (MLCF) module. This module combines object-sensitive
fused features from the detection task and aggregates features across multiple
modalities, scales, and tasks to obtain more semantically rich fused features.
Moreover, we utilize the position prior from the detection task in the Object
Enhancement (OE) loss function, further increasing the retention of object
semantics in the fused images. The detection task also utilizes preliminary
fused features from the fusion task to complement SWIR and LWIR features,
thereby enhancing detection performance. Additionally, we have established a
Nearshore Ship Long-Short Wave Registration (NSLSR) dataset to train effective
SWIR and LWIR image fusion and detection networks, bridging a gap in this
field. We validated the superiority of our proposed single-stage fusion
detection algorithm on two datasets. The source code and dataset are available

### [261] [M-Net: MRI Brain Tumor Sequential Segmentation Network via Mesh-Cast](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20582)
*Jiacheng Lu,Hui Ding,Shiyu Zhang,Guoping Huo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces M-Net, a framework for MRI tumor segmentation that incorporates temporal-like correlations between MRI slices using a novel Mesh-Cast mechanism, achieving better accuracy with reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underutilization of spatial correlations between sequential MRI slices in current segmentation models, which can improve segmentation continuity and accuracy.

Method: The authors propose the M-Net framework, leveraging a Mesh-Cast mechanism and a Two-Phase Sequential training strategy to capture spatial and temporal-like correlations while reducing the computational burden associated with 3D convolutions.

Result: Experiments on BraTS2019 and BraTS2023 datasets show that M-Net outperforms existing methods across all key metrics, proving its efficacy and robustness.

Conclusion: M-Net provides a computationally efficient and temporally-aware solution for MRI tumor segmentation, leveraging sequential information to improve performance and robustness compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: MRI tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
volumetric analysis faces unique computational demands due to the complexity of
3D data. The spatially sequential arrangement of adjacent MRI slices provides
valuable information that enhances segmentation continuity and accuracy, yet
this characteristic remains underutilized in many existing models. The spatial
correlations between adjacent MRI slices can be regarded as "temporal-like"
data, similar to frame sequences in video segmentation tasks. To bridge this
gap, we propose M-Net, a flexible framework specifically designed for
sequential image segmentation. M-Net introduces the novel Mesh-Cast mechanism,
which seamlessly integrates arbitrary sequential models into the processing of
both channel and temporal information, thereby systematically capturing the
inherent "temporal-like" spatial correlations between MRI slices. Additionally,
we define an MRI sequential input pattern and design a Two-Phase Sequential
(TPS) training strategy, which first focuses on learning common patterns across
sequences before refining slice-specific feature extraction. This approach
leverages temporal modeling techniques to preserve volumetric contextual
information while avoiding the high computational cost of full 3D convolutions,
thereby enhancing the generalizability and robustness of M-Net in sequential
segmentation tasks. Experiments on the BraTS2019 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that M-Net outperforms existing methods across all key metrics,
establishing itself as a robust solution for temporally-aware MRI tumor
segmentation.

### [262] [Harnessing Diffusion-Yielded Score Priors for Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20590)
*Xinqi Lin,Fanghua Yu,Jinfan Hu,Zhiyuan You,Wu Shi,Jimmy S. Ren,Jinjin Gu,Chao Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HYPIR, a novel image restoration method combining pre-trained diffusion models and adversarial training for enhanced quality, fidelity, and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image restoration methods struggle to balance restoration quality, fidelity, and speed while addressing critical challenges like degradation removal and pixel-level consistency.

Method: HYPIR initializes image restoration using a pre-trained diffusion model, followed by adversarial fine-tuning. It skips diffusion loss, iterative sampling, and adapters, ensuring stability and faster convergence.

Result: HYPIR delivers faster convergence, real-time inference, and higher-quality restoration, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods in efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: HYPIR overcomes limitations of previous MSE-based, GAN-based, and diffusion-based methods by blending strengths from diffusion and adversarial models, unlocking improved control, texture richness, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Deep image restoration models aim to learn a mapping from degraded image
space to natural image space. However, they face several critical challenges:
removing degradation, generating realistic details, and ensuring pixel-level
consistency. Over time, three major classes of methods have emerged, including
MSE-based, GAN-based, and diffusion-based methods. However, they fail to
achieve a good balance between restoration quality, fidelity, and speed. We
propose a novel method, HYPIR, to address these challenges. Our solution
pipeline is straightforward: it involves initializing the image restoration
model with a pre-trained diffusion model and then fine-tuning it with
adversarial training. This approach does not rely on diffusion loss, iterative
sampling, or additional adapters. We theoretically demonstrate that
initializing adversarial training from a pre-trained diffusion model positions
the initial restoration model very close to the natural image distribution.
Consequently, this initialization improves numerical stability, avoids mode
collapse, and substantially accelerates the convergence of adversarial
training. Moreover, HYPIR inherits the capabilities of diffusion models with
rich user control, enabling text-guided restoration and adjustable texture
richness. Requiring only a single forward pass, it achieves faster convergence
and inference speed than diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments show
that HYPIR outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving efficient
and high-quality image restoration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of deepfake and face swap technologies poses major risks to digital security, particularly in processes like identity verification. Traditional detection techniques fail to reliably identify advanced manipulations.

Method: The proposed approach utilizes a hybrid deep-learning framework that integrates handcrafted frequency-domain features (e.g., Steganalysis Rich Model, DCT, ELA, SVD, DFT) with spatial RGB inputs to detect image manipulations.

Result: The fusion of frequency and spatial domain data enriches the information available to the classifier, improving its ability to detect facial manipulations.

Conclusion: By combining frequency and spatial domain analysis, the framework offers a more robust tool for detecting deepfake and other facial manipulation techniques.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deepfake and face swap technologies has raised
significant concerns in digital security, particularly in identity verification
and onboarding processes. Conventional detection methods often struggle to
generalize against sophisticated facial manipulations. This study proposes an
enhanced deep-learning detection framework that combines handcrafted
frequency-domain features with conventional RGB inputs. This hybrid approach
exploits frequency and spatial domain artifacts introduced during image
manipulation, providing richer and more discriminative information to the
classifier. Several frequency handcrafted features were evaluated, including
the Steganalysis Rich Model, Discrete Cosine Transform, Error Level Analysis,
Singular Value Decomposition, and Discrete Fourier Transform

*Yang Zhao,Shusheng Li,Xueshang Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight framework for remote sensing scene classification, focusing on optimizing accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency for edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimize trade-offs between accuracy, inference latency, and energy consumption in remote sensing classification models running on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: The authors used a distilled GFNet model via frequency domain distillation to reduce size, coupled with a dynamic early-exit mechanism to improve inference efficiency.

Result: The framework achieved a 1.3x speedup in model inference and improved energy efficiency by over 40%, while maintaining high classification accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight RSSC framework is well-suited for edge devices, delivering state-of-the-art performance in terms of speed and energy efficiency without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: As the development of lightweight deep learning algorithms, various deep
neural network (DNN) models have been proposed for the remote sensing scene
classification (RSSC) application. However, it is still challenging for these
RSSC models to achieve optimal performance among model accuracy, inference
latency, and energy consumption on resource-constrained edge devices. In this
paper, we propose a lightweight RSSC framework, which includes a distilled
global filter network (GFNet) model and an early-exit mechanism designed for
edge devices to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, we first
apply frequency domain distillation on the GFNet model to reduce model size.
Then we design a dynamic early-exit model tailored for DNN models on edge
devices to further improve model inference efficiency. We evaluate our E3C
model on three edge devices across four datasets. Extensive experimental
results show that it achieves an average of 1.3x speedup on model inference and
over 40% improvement on energy efficiency, while maintaining high
classification accuracy.

*Dezhi An,Wenqiang Liu,Kefan Wang,Zening Chen,Jun Lu,Shengcai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel dual-path architecture for efficient video anomaly detection using hierarchical feature learning and multimodal integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video anomaly detection is challenging due to multiscale dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and limited labeled data.

Method: The DAMS framework combines Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) for feature reconstruction and CBAM for attention mapping, alongside CLIP for cross-modal semantic alignment.

Result: Experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets validate the framework's effectiveness in anomaly detection.

Conclusion: The proposed DAMS framework offers a robust solution for spatio-temporal localization of video anomalies through its complementary paths and fusion mechanisms.

Abstract: The goal of video anomaly detection is tantamount to performing
spatio-temporal localization of abnormal events in the video. The multiscale
temporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and the scarcity of
labeled data exhibited by video anomalies collectively present a challenging
research problem in computer vision. This study offers a dual-path architecture
called the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS),
which is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient
anomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and
complementary information. The main processing path of this framework
integrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the
Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained
representation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features
through a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature
fusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy
distribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention
mapping. Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a
contrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic
alignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order
semantic guidance for spatio-temporal features. This creates a complete
inference chain from the underlying spatio-temporal features to high-level
semantic concepts. The orthogonal complementarity of the two paths and the
information fusion mechanism jointly construct a comprehensive representation
and identification capability for anomalous events. Extensive experimental
results on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks establish the effectiveness
of the DAMS framework.

*Ao Li,Yuxiang Duan,Jinghui Zhang,Congbo Ma,Yutong Xie,Gustavo Carneiro,Mohammad Yaqub,Hu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransPrune is an efficient token pruning method for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) that uses token transitions to maintain accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs in LVLMs due to numerous visual tokens drive the need for efficient token pruning while maintaining model performance.

Method: TransPrune combines Token Transition Variation (TTV) to analyze representation changes and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA) to measure instruction-focused attention, allowing progressive token pruning without requiring additional training.

Result: Extensive experiments show TransPrune reduces inference TFLOPs by over half while maintaining performance across eight multimodal benchmarks comparable to LVLMs like LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next.

Conclusion: Token transitions provide valuable semantic signals, and TransPrune introduces an innovative, attention-independent approach for token pruning, potentially advancing efficiency in LVLMs.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multimodal learning but
face high computational costs due to the large number of visual tokens,
motivating token pruning to improve inference efficiency. The key challenge
lies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches
rely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they
inherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this
work, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token
transitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations
provides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we
propose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method.
Specifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their
importance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which
measures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token
representations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how
strongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal
performance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight
benchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV
alone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention,
achieving performance comparable to attention-based methods. The code will be
made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to recover continuous colormaps from 2D scalar visualizations, even without a color legend, using a decoupling-and-reconstruction approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of recovering continuous colormaps from scalar field visualizations, particularly in the absence of a corresponding color legend, motivates the research.

Method: The method includes separating visualization into colormap and data via a decoupling module and reconstructing it using a differentiable color-mapping module, guided by a reconstruction loss. Smoothness and color order are ensured by compact colormap representation with cubic B-spline curves.

Result: The method performs well quantitatively and qualitatively on synthetic/real datasets, and its utility is demonstrated through applications like colormap adjustment and transfer, while exploring generalization to visualizations with legends or discrete palettes.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively predicts colormaps and underlying data from visualizations, offering potential applications in visualization adjustments and extending to diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Recovering a continuous colormap from a single 2D scalar field visualization
can be quite challenging, especially in the absence of a corresponding color
legend. In this paper, we propose a novel colormap recovery approach that
extracts the colormap from a color-encoded 2D scalar field visualization by
simultaneously predicting the colormap and underlying data using a
decoupling-and-reconstruction strategy. Our approach first separates the input
visualization into colormap and data using a decoupling module, then
reconstructs the visualization with a differentiable color-mapping module. To
guide this process, we design a reconstruction loss between the input and
reconstructed visualizations, which serves both as a constraint to ensure
strong correlation between colormap and data during training, and as a
self-supervised optimizer for fine-tuning the predicted colormap of unseen
visualizations during inferencing. To ensure smoothness and correct color
ordering in the extracted colormap, we introduce a compact colormap
representation using cubic B-spline curves and an associated color order loss.
We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on a synthetic dataset
and a collection of real-world visualizations from the VIS30K dataset.
Additionally, we demonstrate its utility in two prototype applications --
colormap adjustment and colormap transfer -- and explore its generalization to
visualizations with color legends and ones encoded using discrete color
palettes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding player movement is essential for applications such as bot navigation and behavior analytics but faces challenges due to complex environments and gameplay interactions.

Method: The paper proposes a U-Net-based architecture that leverages a multimodal feature encoder and multi-head attention to handle image, numerical, categorical, and dynamic game data.

Result: The technique produces probability heatmaps for future player locations, enabling communication among agents and efficient utilization of heterogeneous game state data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a foundation for tasks such as predictive bot behavior and player anomaly detection by accurately forecasting player positions.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting player movement in multiplayer games is crucial
for achieving use cases such as player-mimicking bot navigation, preemptive bot
control, strategy recommendation, and real-time player behavior analytics.
However, the complex environments allow for a high degree of navigational
freedom, and the interactions and team-play between players require models that
make effective use of the available heterogeneous input data. This paper
presents a multimodal architecture for predicting future player locations on a
dynamic time horizon, using a U-Net-based approach for calculating endpoint
location probability heatmaps, conditioned using a multimodal feature encoder.
The application of a multi-head attention mechanism for different groups of
features allows for communication between agents. In doing so, the architecture
makes efficient use of the multimodal game state including image inputs,
numerical and categorical features, as well as dynamic game data. Consequently,
the presented technique lays the foundation for various downstream tasks that
rely on future player positions such as the creation of player-predictive bot
behavior or player anomaly detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for camera orientation estimation using minimal calibration when full calibration is impractical, especially in constrained environments.

Method: Calculation of roll and pitch angles using inverse projection geometry with assumptions of known intrinsic parameters, fixed camera height, and detection of a single straight reference line.

Result: The method provides efficient orientation estimation leveraging geometric constraints and lens distortion correction, suitable for lightweight multi-camera systems.

Conclusion: The proposed technique offers a practical, minimally calibrated solution for estimating camera orientation in constrained setups.

Abstract: We present a derivation for estimating the roll and pitch orientation of a
partially calibrated camera mounted above a planar surface, using minimal scene
information. Specifically, we assume known intrinsic parameters and a fixed
height between the camera and the observed plane. By detecting a single
straight reference line at a known planar distance -- such as the edge between
a floor and a wall -- we estimate the roll and pitch angles via inverse
projection geometry. The method leverages geometric constraints and the camera

*Haowen Li,Zhenfeng Fan,Zhang Wen,Zhengzhou Zhu,Yunjin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a text-free, efficient cross-domain image composition method that preserves foreground content and diffusion priors through backward inversion and forward denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in cross-domain image composition such as the stochasticity of diffusion models, style gaps, and dependence on text prompts.

Method: The approach integrates CLIP features from foreground and background using a simple multilayer perceptron network and manipulates diffusion with a local cross-attention strategy without requiring additional training.

Result: The method improves the LPIPS score by 30.5% and the CSD metric by 18.1%, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in evaluations. Additionally, a benchmark dataset for testing was created.

Conclusion: The research provides a robust, practical foundation for future advancements in cross-domain image composition and stylization without reliance on text prompts.

Abstract: Image composition has advanced significantly with large-scale pre-trained T2I
diffusion models. Despite progress in same-domain composition, cross-domain
composition remains under-explored. The main challenges are the stochastic
nature of diffusion models and the style gap between input images, leading to
failures and artifacts. Additionally, heavy reliance on text prompts limits
practical applications. This paper presents the first cross-domain image
composition method that does not require text prompts, allowing natural
stylization and seamless compositions. Our method is efficient and robust,
preserving the diffusion prior, as it involves minor steps for backward
inversion and forward denoising without training the diffuser. Our method also
uses a simple multilayer perceptron network to integrate CLIP features from
foreground and background, manipulating diffusion with a local cross-attention
strategy. It effectively preserves foreground content while enabling stable
stylization without a pre-stylization network. Finally, we create a benchmark
dataset with diverse contents and styles for fair evaluation, addressing the
lack of testing datasets for cross-domain image composition. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, significantly improving the LPIPS score by 30.5% and the CSD
metric by 18.1%. We believe our method will advance future research and
applications. Code and benchmark at https://github.com/sherlhw/AIComposer.

### [272] [Style-Aware Blending and Prototype-Based Cross-Contrast Consistency for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20729)
*Chaowei Chen,Xiang Zhang,Honglie Guo,Shunfang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper highlights deficiencies in current weak-strong consistency learning strategies for semi-supervised medical image segmentation and proposes a framework to address these gaps through style-aware blending and prototype-based cross-contrast strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in existing weak-strong consistency learning methods, which focus only on perturbation schemes and suffer from separated data streams and incomplete supervisory information.

Method: The framework includes a style-guided distribution blending module to merge labeled and unlabeled data streams and a prototype-based cross-contrast strategy to leverage strong-to-weak and weak-to-strong consistency while mitigating noise in pseudo-labels.

Result: The proposed framework showed superior performance and effectiveness across different medical image segmentation benchmarks and semi-supervised settings.

Conclusion: The study successfully introduces a new framework to overcome the limitations of existing methodologies, enhancing the consistency and performance of semi-supervised medical image segmentation models.

Abstract: Weak-strong consistency learning strategies are widely employed in
semi-supervised medical image segmentation to train models by leveraging
limited labeled data and enforcing weak-to-strong consistency. However,
existing methods primarily focus on designing and combining various
perturbation schemes, overlooking the inherent potential and limitations within
the framework itself. In this paper, we first identify two critical
deficiencies: (1) separated training data streams, which lead to confirmation
bias dominated by the labeled stream; and (2) incomplete utilization of
supervisory information, which limits exploration of strong-to-weak
consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a style-aware blending and
prototype-based cross-contrast consistency learning framework. Specifically,
inspired by the empirical observation that the distribution mismatch between
labeled and unlabeled data can be characterized by statistical moments, we
design a style-guided distribution blending module to break the independent
training data streams. Meanwhile, considering the potential noise in strong
pseudo-labels, we introduce a prototype-based cross-contrast strategy to
encourage the model to learn informative supervisory signals from both
weak-to-strong and strong-to-weak predictions, while mitigating the adverse
effects of noise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our framework across multiple medical segmentation benchmarks
under various semi-supervised settings.

*Geng-Xin Xu,Xiang Zuo,Ye Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMQ-Net for improved emotion recognition from physiological data, addressing data incompleteness and noise issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve emotion recognition, which is key in mental health, but challenged by incomplete data and noise.

Method: The method includes a Multi-Masked Querying Network (MMQ-Net) employing multiple querying mechanisms: modality, category, and interference queries.

Result: MMQ-Net achieves superior performance in emotion recognition, especially with highly incomplete data.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses the challenges of incomplete signals and noise, offering a significant improvement over existing methods.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from physiological data is crucial for mental health
assessment, yet it faces two significant challenges: incomplete multi-modal
signals and interference from body movements and artifacts. This paper presents
a novel Multi-Masked Querying Network (MMQ-Net) to address these issues by
integrating multiple querying mechanisms into a unified framework.
Specifically, it uses modality queries to reconstruct missing data from
incomplete signals, category queries to focus on emotional state features, and
interference queries to separate relevant information from noise. Extensive
experiment results demonstrate the superior emotion recognition performance of
MMQ-Net compared to existing approaches, particularly under high levels of data
incompleteness.

### [274] [Implicit Counterfactual Learning for Audio-Visual Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20740)
*Mingfeng Zha,Tianyu Li,Guoqing Wang,Peng Wang,Yangyang Wu,Yang Yang,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the implicit counterfactual framework (ICF) for audio-visual segmentation (AVS), addressing representation discrepancies between audio and visual data, and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AVS methods fail to address modality representation discrepancies and imbalances, often resulting in erroneous matches, especially in complex scenes.

Method: The proposed approach uses multi-granularity implicit text (MIT) for modal alignment, semantic counterfactual (SC) to create orthogonal latent representations, and collaborative distribution-aware contrastive learning (CDCL) for aligning and decoupling representations.

Result: The proposed method was extensively tested on three public datasets and demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in audio-visual segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively tackles biases and modality gaps in AVS, improving cross-modal understanding and overall segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) aims to segment objects in videos based on
audio cues. Existing AVS methods are primarily designed to enhance interaction
efficiency but pay limited attention to modality representation discrepancies
and imbalances. To overcome this, we propose the implicit counterfactual
framework (ICF) to achieve unbiased cross-modal understanding. Due to the lack
of semantics, heterogeneous representations may lead to erroneous matches,
especially in complex scenes with ambiguous visual content or interference from
multiple audio sources. We introduce the multi-granularity implicit text (MIT)
involving video-, segment- and frame-level as the bridge to establish the
modality-shared space, reducing modality gaps and providing prior guidance.
Visual content carries more information and typically dominates, thereby
marginalizing audio features in the decision-making. To mitigate knowledge
preference, we propose the semantic counterfactual (SC) to learn orthogonal
representations in the latent space, generating diverse counterfactual samples,
thus avoiding biases introduced by complex functional designs and explicit
modifications of text structures or attributes. We further formulate the
collaborative distribution-aware contrastive learning (CDCL), incorporating
factual-counterfactual and inter-modality contrasts to align representations,
promoting cohesion and decoupling. Extensive experiments on three public
datasets validate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

### [275] [Regularizing Subspace Redundancy of Low-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20745)
*Yue Zhu,Haiwen Diao,Shang Gao,Jiazuo Yu,Jiawen Zhu,Yunzhi Zhuge,Shuai Hao,Xu Jia,Lu Zhang,Ying Zhang,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReSoRA enhances Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) by addressing subspace redundancy, improving performance in Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PETL methods like LoRA suffer from representation redundancy in their projection matrices, reducing adaptation effectiveness. Current solutions lack flexibility and generalizability.

Method: ReSoRA models and reduces redundancy between mapping subspaces by decomposing low-rank submatrices and applying de-redundancy constraints on feature distributions across projections.

Result: ReSoRA consistently improves the performance of PETL methods across various backbones, datasets, and benchmarks in both vision-language retrieval and visual classification tasks.

Conclusion: ReSoRA is a practical and effective enhancement for existing PETL methods, providing better generalization and no additional inference cost, and can be integrated seamlessly as a plug-and-play solution.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have delivered strong capability
in Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) by minimizing trainable
parameters and benefiting from reparameterization. However, their projection
matrices remain unrestricted during training, causing high representation
redundancy and diminishing the effectiveness of feature adaptation in the
resulting subspaces. While existing methods mitigate this by manually adjusting
the rank or implicitly applying channel-wise masks, they lack flexibility and
generalize poorly across various datasets and architectures. Hence, we propose
ReSoRA, a method that explicitly models redundancy between mapping subspaces
and adaptively Regularizes Subspace redundancy of Low-Rank Adaptation.
Specifically, it theoretically decomposes the low-rank submatrices into
multiple equivalent subspaces and systematically applies de-redundancy
constraints to the feature distributions across different projections.
Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method consistently
facilitates existing state-of-the-art PETL methods across various backbones and
datasets in vision-language retrieval and standard visual classification
benchmarks. Besides, as a training supervision, ReSoRA can be seamlessly
integrated into existing approaches in a plug-and-play manner, with no
additional inference costs. Code is publicly available at:

### [276] [Learning to See Inside Opaque Liquid Containers using Speckle Vibrometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20757)
*Matan Kichler,Shai Bagon,Mark Sheinin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to infer the liquid levels in opaque and sealed containers using vibration sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vision systems fail to determine hidden states, like liquid levels in sealed containers, which limits functionality.

Method: The authors propose a vibration-sensing system combined with transformer-based data analysis to classify container type and liquid level.

Result: The system successfully estimates liquid levels across ambient and controlled environments and generalizes to unseen container instances within known classes.

Conclusion: This work broadens computer vision capabilities by integrating vibration sensing for remote monitoring of hidden features in everyday containers.

Abstract: Computer vision seeks to infer a wide range of information about objects and
events. However, vision systems based on conventional imaging are limited to
extracting information only from the visible surfaces of scene objects. For
instance, a vision system can detect and identify a Coke can in the scene, but
it cannot determine whether the can is full or empty. In this paper, we aim to
expand the scope of computer vision to include the novel task of inferring the
hidden liquid levels of opaque containers by sensing the tiny vibrations on
their surfaces. Our method provides a first-of-a-kind way to inspect the fill
level of multiple sealed containers remotely, at once, without needing physical
manipulation and manual weighing. First, we propose a novel speckle-based
vibration sensing system for simultaneously capturing scene vibrations on a 2D
grid of points. We use our system to efficiently and remotely capture a dataset
of vibration responses for a variety of everyday liquid containers. Then, we
develop a transformer-based approach for analyzing the captured vibrations and
classifying the container type and its hidden liquid level at the time of
measurement. Our architecture is invariant to the vibration source, yielding
correct liquid level estimates for controlled and ambient scene sound sources.
Moreover, our model generalizes to unseen container instances within known
classes (e.g., training on five Coke cans of a six-pack, testing on a sixth)
and fluid levels. We demonstrate our method by recovering liquid levels from
various everyday containers.

### [277] [KASportsFormer: Kinematic Anatomy Enhanced Transformer for 3D Human Pose Estimation on Short Sports Scene Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20763)
*Zhuoer Yin,Calvin Yeung,Tomohiro Suzuki,Ryota Tanaka,Keisuke Fujii*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KASportsFormer is a transformer-based framework for 3D human pose estimation in sports, addressing challenges like motion blur and instantaneous actions to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer-based methods struggle in sports scenarios due to complex actions, motion blur, occlusions, and the need to focus on instantaneous motions.

Method: KASportsFormer introduces kinematic anatomy-informed modules (Bone Extractor and Limb Fuser) for multimodal encoding of motion information to tackle sports-specific challenges.

Result: Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance with MPJPE errors of 58.0mm on SportsPose and 34.3mm on WorldPose datasets.

Conclusion: KASportsFormer effectively addresses critical challenges in 3D sports pose estimation and demonstrates significant improvement in accuracy for sports scenarios.

Abstract: Recent transformer based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance
in solving real-world 3D human pose estimation problems. Albeit these
approaches achieve fruitful results on benchmark datasets, they tend to fall
short of sports scenarios where human movements are more complicated than daily
life actions, as being hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts.
Moreover, due to the fact that critical motions in a sports game often finish
in moments of time (e.g., shooting), the ability to focus on momentary actions
is becoming a crucial factor in sports analysis, where current methods appear
to struggle with instantaneous scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce KASportsFormer, a novel transformer based 3D pose estimation
framework for sports that incorporates a kinematic anatomy-informed feature
representation and integration module. In which the inherent kinematic motion
information is extracted with the Bone Extractor (BoneExt) and Limb Fuser
(LimbFus) modules and encoded in a multimodal manner. This improved the
capability of comprehending sports poses in short videos. We evaluate our
method through two representative sports scene datasets: SportsPose and
WorldPose. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art results with MPJPE errors of 58.0mm and 34.3mm, respectively.

### [278] [ATR-UMMIM: A Benchmark Dataset for UAV-Based Multimodal Image Registration under Complex Imaging Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20764)
*Kangcheng Bin,Chen Chen,Ting Hu,Jiahao Qi,Ping Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ATR-UMMIM, the first benchmark dataset for multimodal image registration in UAV-based applications, comprising diverse airborne-visible and infrared image triplets with robust annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of a publicly available benchmark dataset for multimodal image registration in UAV-based aerial scenarios, which hinders the development and evaluation of advanced registration methods.

Method: The authors created the ATR-UMMIM dataset, which includes 7,969 visible and infrared image triplets annotated with pixel-level registration, imaging condition attributes, object-level annotations, and diverse environmental and flight variables. They also developed a semi-automated annotation pipeline to ensure high registration quality.

Result: The documented ATR-UMMIM dataset captures diverse conditions (e.g., weather, illumination, flight altitudes, viewing angles) and provides 77,753 visible and 78,409 infrared bounding box annotations covering 11 object categories.

Conclusion: ATR-UMMIM offers a comprehensive and robust benchmark dataset, aiming to advance multimodal registration, fusion, and perception for UAV applications. The dataset supports further research and development in this domain.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has become a key enabler for UAV-based object detection, as
each modality provides complementary cues for robust feature extraction.
However, due to significant differences in resolution, field of view, and
sensing characteristics across modalities, accurate registration is a
prerequisite before fusion. Despite its importance, there is currently no
publicly available benchmark specifically designed for multimodal registration
in UAV-based aerial scenarios, which severely limits the development and
evaluation of advanced registration methods under real-world conditions. To
bridge this gap, we present ATR-UMMIM, the first benchmark dataset specifically
tailored for multimodal image registration in UAV-based applications. This
dataset includes 7,969 triplets of raw visible, infrared, and precisely
registered visible images captured covers diverse scenarios including flight
altitudes from 80m to 300m, camera angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and
all-day, all-year temporal variations under rich weather and illumination
conditions. To ensure high registration quality, we design a semi-automated
annotation pipeline to introduce reliable pixel-level ground truth to each
triplet. In addition, each triplet is annotated with six imaging condition
attributes, enabling benchmarking of registration robustness under real-world
deployment settings. To further support downstream tasks, we provide
object-level annotations on all registered images, covering 11 object
categories with 77,753 visible and 78,409 infrared bounding boxes. We believe
ATR-UMMIM will serve as a foundational benchmark for advancing multimodal
registration, fusion, and perception in real-world UAV scenarios. The datatset

### [279] [Learning Only with Images: Visual Reinforcement Learning with Reasoning, Rendering, and Visual Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20766)
*Yang Chen,Yufan Shen,Wenxuan Huang,Shen Zhou,Qunshu Lin,Xinyu Cai,Zhi Yu,Botian Shi,Yu Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the "Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback" (RRVF) framework to enhance visual reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) using raw images and reinforcement learning, eliminating the reliance on curated image-text data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the limitation of MLLMs relying heavily on image-text supervision for visual reasoning.

Method: RRVF utilizes a closed-loop iterative process involving reasoning, rendering, and visual feedback, guided by the "Asymmetry of Verification" principle and optimized via the GRPO algorithm using reinforcement learning.

Result: Experiments focusing on image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces demonstrate that RRVF significantly outperforms existing MLLMs and supervised baselines.

Conclusion: RRVF provides a promising approach for developing robust and generalizable reasoning models based purely on visual feedback, without explicit supervision.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive
performance across various visual tasks. Subsequent investigations into
enhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their
performance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of
MLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated
image-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework
termed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to
learn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on
the ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the
rendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We
demonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for
optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on
the image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a
closed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual
feedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through
multi-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be
optimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments
on image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces show that RRVF
substantially outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and surpasses supervised
fine-tuning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that systems driven by purely
visual feedback present a viable path toward more robust and generalizable
reasoning models without requiring explicit supervision. Code will be available
at https://github.com/L-O-I/RRVF.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Remote sensing images faced limitations in vision-language models, and RingMo-Agent addresses them with a large dataset and a unified, adaptive framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language frameworks for remote sensing struggle to handle diverse modalities effectively, limiting their real-world applicability. This motivates the need for a unified solution.

Method: RingMo-Agent leverages the RS-VL3M dataset, a modality-adaptive architecture with isolated feature embeddings for modalities, task-specific tokens, and a high-dimensional decoding mechanism.

Result: Extensive experiments show effective performance in visual understanding, analytical tasks, and generalizability across modalities and platforms.

Conclusion: RingMo-Agent advances vision-language tasks in remote sensing by offering a robust, unified framework, overcoming traditional limitations.

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) images from multiple modalities and platforms exhibit
diverse details due to differences in sensor characteristics and imaging
perspectives. Existing vision-language research in RS largely relies on
relatively homogeneous data sources. Moreover, they still remain limited to
conventional visual perception tasks such as classification or captioning. As a
result, these methods fail to serve as a unified and standalone framework
capable of effectively handling RS imagery from diverse sources in real-world
applications. To address these issues, we propose RingMo-Agent, a model
designed to handle multi-modal and multi-platform data that performs perception
and reasoning tasks based on user textual instructions. Compared with existing
models, RingMo-Agent 1) is supported by a large-scale vision-language dataset
named RS-VL3M, comprising over 3 million image-text pairs, spanning optical,
SAR, and infrared (IR) modalities collected from both satellite and UAV
platforms, covering perception and challenging reasoning tasks; 2) learns
modality adaptive representations by incorporating separated embedding layers
to construct isolated features for heterogeneous modalities and reduce
cross-modal interference; 3) unifies task modeling by introducing task-specific
tokens and employing a token-based high-dimensional hidden state decoding
mechanism designed for long-horizon spatial tasks. Extensive experiments on
various RS vision-language tasks demonstrate that RingMo-Agent not only proves
effective in both visual understanding and sophisticated analytical tasks, but
also exhibits strong generalizability across different platforms and sensing
modalities.

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of synthetic data for training face recognition (FR) models, analyzing its impact on accuracy and fairness, using balanced datasets and text-to-image generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the potential of synthetic data in achieving both high accuracy and fairness in FR systems.

Method: The authors generated the FairFaceGen dataset using text-to-image generators (Flux.1-dev, Stable Diffusion v3.5) and applied identity augmentation methods (Arc2Face, IP-Adapters). They analyzed FR performance with standard and racial bias benchmarks.

Result: Synthetic data underperforms real data in generalization but shows promise in reducing demographic bias, especially using SD35. Augmentation quality and quantity are key factors for system performance.

Conclusion: The study offers guidelines for developing fairer FR systems, emphasizing the role of synthetic datasets in potentially mitigating bias.

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a promising alternative for training face
recognition (FR) models, offering advantages in scalability, privacy
compliance, and potential for bias mitigation. However, critical questions
remain on whether both high accuracy and fairness can be achieved with
synthetic data. In this work, we evaluate the impact of synthetic data on bias
and performance of FR systems. We generate balanced face dataset, FairFaceGen,
using two state of the art text-to-image generators, Flux.1-dev and Stable
Diffusion v3.5 (SD35), and combine them with several identity augmentation
methods, including Arc2Face and four IP-Adapters. By maintaining equal identity
count across synthetic and real datasets, we ensure fair comparisons when
evaluating FR performance on standard (LFW, AgeDB-30, etc.) and challenging
IJB-B/C benchmarks and FR bias on Racial Faces in-the-Wild (RFW) dataset. Our
results demonstrate that although synthetic data still lags behind the real
datasets in the generalization on IJB-B/C, demographically balanced synthetic
datasets, especially those generated with SD35, show potential for bias
mitigation. We also observe that the number and quality of intra-class
augmentations significantly affect FR accuracy and fairness. These findings
provide practical guidelines for constructing fairer FR systems using synthetic
data.

*Francesca Razzano,Wenyu Yang,Sergio Vitale,Giampaolo Ferraioli,Silvia Liberata Ullo,Gilda Schirinzi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FGump is a forest height estimation framework using SAR and gradient boosting, offering high accuracy and efficiency, surpassing traditional ML/DL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate forest height estimation is essential for environmental monitoring and carbon assessment. Existing methods either rely on extensive data for ML/DL or traditional techniques with limitations.

Method: This framework employs gradient boosting with multi-channel SAR data and LiDAR profiles as ground truth. It avoids heavy preprocessing by using a small set of hand-designed features.

Result: FGump achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to SOTA AI-based and classical methods, excelling in both classification and continuous regression tasks.

Conclusion: FGump demonstrates an effective balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, showcasing its potential for fine-grained forest height estimation.

Abstract: Accurate forest height estimation is crucial for climate change monitoring
and carbon cycle assessment. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), particularly in
multi-channel configurations, has provided support for a long time in 3D forest
structure reconstruction through model-based techniques. More recently,
data-driven approaches using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have
enabled new opportunities for forest parameter retrieval. This paper introduces
FGump, a forest height estimation framework by gradient boosting using
multi-channel SAR processing with LiDAR profiles as Ground Truth(GT). Unlike
typical ML and DL approaches that require large datasets and complex
architectures, FGump ensures a strong balance between accuracy and
computational efficiency, using a limited set of hand-designed features and
avoiding heavy preprocessing (e.g., calibration and/or quantization). Evaluated
under both classification and regression paradigms, the proposed framework
demonstrates that the regression formulation enables fine-grained, continuous
estimations and avoids quantization artifacts by resulting in more precise
measurements without rounding. Experimental results confirm that FGump
outperforms State-of-the-Art (SOTA) AI-based and classical methods, achieving
higher accuracy and significantly lower training and inference times, as
demonstrated in our results.

*Pavel Korshunov,Amir Mohammadi,Vidit Vidit,Christophe Ecabert,Sébastien Marcel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FantasyID, a novel dataset that facilitates the detection of forged identity documents and reveals limitations in current forgery detection algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of advanced image generation tools enables malicious actors to forge images, posing significant risks to Know Your Customer (KYC) applications.

Method: The authors developed FantasyID, a dataset containing realistic ID cards with diverse designs, languages, and authentic faces. They simulated forgery attacks and evaluated detection algorithms under practical conditions.

Result: State-of-the-art forgery detection algorithms exhibited poor performance on the FantasyID dataset, with high false negative rates (~50%) when operating at a false positive rate of 10%.

Conclusion: FantasyID proves to be a challenging and valuable benchmark for evaluating and improving forgery detection systems in KYC contexts.

Abstract: Advancements in image generation led to the availability of easy-to-use tools
for malicious actors to create forged images. These tools pose a serious threat
to the widespread Know Your Customer (KYC) applications, requiring robust
systems for detection of the forged Identity Documents (IDs). To facilitate the
development of the detection algorithms, in this paper, we propose a novel
publicly available (including commercial use) dataset, FantasyID, which mimics
real-world IDs but without tampering with legal documents and, compared to
previous public datasets, it does not contain generated faces or specimen
watermarks. FantasyID contains ID cards with diverse design styles, languages,
and faces of real people. To simulate a realistic KYC scenario, the cards from
FantasyID were printed and captured with three different devices, constituting
the bonafide class. We have emulated digital forgery/injection attacks that
could be performed by a malicious actor to tamper the IDs using the existing
generative tools. The current state-of-the-art forgery detection algorithms,
such as TruFor, MMFusion, UniFD, and FatFormer, are challenged by FantasyID
dataset. It especially evident, in the evaluation conditions close to
practical, with the operational threshold set on validation set so that false
positive rate is at 10%, leading to false negative rates close to 50% across
the board on the test set. The evaluation experiments demonstrate that
FantasyID dataset is complex enough to be used as an evaluation benchmark for
detection algorithms.

*Chunshi Wang,Bin Zhao,Shuxue Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel attention module, Split Coordinate Attention (SCA), that enhances building footprint extraction from remote sensing images by improving semantic feature extraction. The proposed SCANet achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets (Wuhan University and Massachusetts).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building footprint extraction is crucial for urban planning, land use, environmental protection, and disaster assessment. Despite advancements in traditional and deep learning approaches, significant challenges remain in achieving high accuracy and efficiency in this task.

Method: The paper proposes a plug-and-play module called Split Coordinate Attention (SCA), applied to 2D CNNs. It employs a dual spatial pooling strategy to encode x and y channels separately and performs split operations for feature groups, which better captures spatially remote interactions for semantic feature extraction.

Result: The proposed SCANet, incorporating the SCA module, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in building footprint extraction. It achieves IoU scores of 91.61% and 75.49% on the Wuhan University and Massachusetts Building Datasets, respectively, setting new benchmarks on these widely-used datasets.

Conclusion: SCANet demonstrates significant advancement in building footprint extraction by effectively leveraging spatial attention and achieving state-of-the-art metrics. This highlights the potential of integrating advanced attention mechanisms in remote sensing image analysis tasks.

Abstract: Building footprint extraction holds immense significance in remote sensing
image analysis and has great value in urban planning, land use, environmental
protection and disaster assessment. Despite the progress made by conventional
and deep learning approaches in this field, they continue to encounter
significant challenges. This paper introduces a novel plug-and-play attention
module, Split Coordinate Attention (SCA), which ingeniously captures spatially
remote interactions by employing two spatial range of pooling kernels,
strategically encoding each channel along x and y planes, and separately
performs a series of split operations for each feature group, thus enabling

### [285] [Rethinking Few Shot CLIP Benchmarks: A Critical Analysis in the Inductive Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20834)
*Alexey Kravets,Da Chen,Vinay P. Namboodiri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies flaws in how CLIP's few-shot classification performance is evaluated, introduces an unlearning pipeline, and improves upon existing methods with new benchmarks and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inadequacy of standard datasets used to benchmark CLIP’s inductive generalization capabilities in few-shot settings, as they often contain samples already seen by CLIP, leading to a partially transductive evaluation.

Method: The authors introduce an unlearning pipeline to create true inductive baselines, validate it using oracle baselines, and propose a new few-shot classification technique evaluated through extensive experimentation across datasets and variables.

Result: Using the unlearning pipeline, existing methods show a significant drop of performance (-55%), demonstrating the weakness of prior evaluations. The paper’s improved method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple scenarios and experiments.

Conclusion: The paper addresses a critical gap in evaluating CLIP’s few-shot classification, introduces a novel unlearning solution, proposes new evaluation benchmarks, and presents an advanced classification method offering superior performance.

Abstract: CLIP is a foundational model with transferable classification performance in
the few-shot setting. Several methods have shown improved performance of CLIP
using few-shot examples. However, so far, all these techniques have been
benchmarked using standard few-shot datasets. We argue that this mode of
evaluation does not provide a true indication of the inductive generalization
ability using few-shot examples. As most datasets have been seen by the CLIP
model, the resultant setting can be termed as partially transductive. To solve
this, we propose a pipeline that uses an unlearning technique to obtain true
inductive baselines. In this new inductive setting, the methods show a
significant drop in performance (-55% on average among 13 baselines with
multiple datasets). We validate the unlearning technique using oracle
baselines. An improved few-shot classification technique is proposed that
consistently obtains state-of-the-art performance over 13 other recent baseline
methods on a comprehensive analysis with 5880 experiments - varying the
datasets, differing number of few-shot examples, unlearning setting, and with
different seeds. Thus, we identify the issue with the evaluation of CLIP-based
few-shot classification, provide a solution using unlearning, propose new
benchmarks, and provide an improved method.

### [286] [METEOR: Multi-Encoder Collaborative Token Pruning for Efficient Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20842)
*Yuchen Liu,Yaoming Wang,Bowen Shi,Xiaopeng Zhang,Wenrui Dai,Chenglin Li,Hongkai Xiong,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces METEOR, a framework that optimizes multi-encoder vision-language models by progressively pruning redundant visual tokens, significantly improving efficiency with minimal performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-encoder models for multimodal tasks have generalization limitations, while multi-encoder solutions, though more effective, suffer from high computational demands. There's a need for more efficient multi-encoder methods.

Method: METEOR employs a progressive token pruning strategy at three stages: 1) rank-guided token pruning within individual vision encoders, 2) cooperative pruning to reduce redundancy during multi-vision fusion, and 3) adaptive token pruning in the large language model decoding stage, dynamically adjusted based on task requirements.

Result: Experimental evaluation across 11 benchmarks shows that METEOR achieves a 76% reduction in visual tokens with only a 0.3% performance drop compared to a standard multi-encoder model like EAGLE.

Conclusion: METEOR offers an innovative and efficient solution for multi-encoder vision-language models, combining effectiveness with reduced computational costs. It highlights the value of multi-stage token pruning in enhancing model efficiency while maintaining task performance.

Abstract: Vision encoders serve as the cornerstone of multimodal understanding.
Single-encoder architectures like CLIP exhibit inherent constraints in
generalizing across diverse multimodal tasks, while recent multi-encoder fusion
methods introduce prohibitive computational overhead to achieve superior
performance using complementary visual representations from multiple vision
encoders. To address this, we propose a progressive pruning framework, namely
Multi-Encoder collaboraTivE tOken pRuning (METEOR), that eliminates redundant
visual tokens across the encoding, fusion, and decoding stages for
multi-encoder MLLMs. For multi-vision encoding, we discard redundant tokens
within each encoder via a rank guided collaborative token assignment strategy.
Subsequently, for multi-vision fusion, we combine the visual features from
different encoders while reducing cross-encoder redundancy with cooperative
pruning. Finally, we propose an adaptive token pruning method in the LLM
decoding stage to further discard irrelevant tokens based on the text prompts
with dynamically adjusting pruning ratios for specific task demands. To our
best knowledge, this is the first successful attempt that achieves an efficient
multi-encoder based vision language model with multi-stage pruning strategies.
Extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach. Compared with EAGLE, a typical multi-encoder MLLMs, METEOR
reduces 76% visual tokens with only 0.3% performance drop in average. The code
is available at https://github.com/YuchenLiu98/METEOR.

*Ruoyu Fan,Yuhui Wen,Jiajia Dai,Tao Zhang,Long Zeng,Yong-jin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: $S^3$LAM is an RGB-D SLAM system using 2D surfel splatting for improved tracking and mapping accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most SLAM systems use 3D Gaussian ellipsoids for geometry representation, which are less efficient and accurate when compared to the proposed 2D Gaussian surfels.

Method: The system employs 2D Gaussian surfel primitives for surface reconstruction and introduces an adaptive rendering strategy to improve mapping accuracy and computational efficiency.

Result: $S^3$LAM shows state-of-the-art performance in tracking and mapping accuracy on various datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a geometrically accurate representation and demonstrates superior performance in SLAM tasks, with its code to be made available for public use.

Abstract: We propose $S^3$LAM, a novel RGB-D SLAM system that leverages 2D surfel
splatting to achieve highly accurate geometric representations for simultaneous
tracking and mapping. Unlike existing 3DGS-based SLAM approaches that rely on
3D Gaussian ellipsoids, we utilize 2D Gaussian surfels as primitives for more
efficient scene representation. By focusing on the surfaces of objects in the
scene, this design enables $S^3$LAM to reconstruct high-quality geometry,
benefiting both mapping and tracking. To address inherent SLAM challenges
including real-time optimization under limited viewpoints, we introduce a novel
adaptive surface rendering strategy that improves mapping accuracy while
maintaining computational efficiency. We further derive camera pose Jacobians
directly from 2D surfel splatting formulation, highlighting the importance of
our geometrically accurate representation that improves tracking convergence.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate that
$S^3$LAM achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code will be made publicly
available.

*Adil Kaan Akan,Yucel Yemez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for creating videos with strong temporal coherence and intuitive object editing by leveraging object-centric representations and pretrained diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of generative capabilities in existing object-centric methods and improve temporal consistency for video synthesis, while enabling compositional editing.

Method: The proposed framework learns pose-invariant object-centric slots and incorporates pretrained diffusion models to synthesize videos with temporal coherence and intuitive object editing capabilities.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art video generation quality and temporal consistency, matches segmentation performance of top methods, and supports interactive and controllable editing.

Conclusion: This approach significantly advances video synthesis and editing, enabling robust content creation, semantic editing, and better dynamic scene understanding.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for compositional video synthesis that leverages
temporally consistent object-centric representations, extending our previous
work, SlotAdapt, from images to video. While existing object-centric approaches
either lack generative capabilities entirely or treat video sequences
holistically, thus neglecting explicit object-level structure, our approach
explicitly captures temporal dynamics by learning pose invariant object-centric
slots and conditioning them on pretrained diffusion models. This design enables
high-quality, pixel-level video synthesis with superior temporal coherence, and
offers intuitive compositional editing capabilities such as object insertion,
deletion, or replacement, maintaining consistent object identities across
frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets new benchmarks
in video generation quality and temporal consistency, outperforming previous
object-centric generative methods. Although our segmentation performance
closely matches state-of-the-art methods, our approach uniquely integrates this
capability with robust generative performance, significantly advancing
interactive and controllable video generation and opening new possibilities for
advanced content creation, semantic editing, and dynamic scene understanding.

### [289] [Ensemble Foreground Management for Unsupervised Object Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20860)
*Ziling Wu,Armaghan Moemeni,Praminda Caleb-Solly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust foreground identification method, and UnionSeg, an efficient transformer model. These methods aid unsupervised object discovery by addressing issues of foreground-background distinction and object count estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised object discovery faces challenges due to lack of labeled ground truth, such as distinguishing foreground from background and understanding the number of undetected objects.

Method: The paper utilizes UnionCut, based on the min-cut and ensemble methods, to determine foreground regions. Additionally, it introduces UnionSeg, a distilled transformer model built on UnionCut for efficient and accurate foreground segmentation.

Result: Experiments show improved performance across benchmarks in single object discovery, saliency detection, and self-supervised instance segmentation when combining UnionCut or UnionSeg with state-of-the-art UOD methods.

Conclusion: UnionCut and UnionSeg significantly enhance UOD by offering robust foreground detection, optimizing object discovery efficiently, and improving segmentation performance across evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery (UOD) aims to detect and segment objects in 2D
images without handcrafted annotations. Recent progress in self-supervised
representation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the
absence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1)
determining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing
how many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous
solutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is
foreground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the
existing foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed
number of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of
objects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and
well-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that
detects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to
identify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the
foreground union in the image is segmented. In addition, we propose UnionSeg, a
distilled transformer of UnionCut that outputs the foreground union more
efficiently and accurately. Our experiments show that by combining with
UnionCut or UnionSeg, previous state-of-the-art UOD methods witness an increase
in the performance of single object discovery, saliency detection and
self-supervised instance segmentation on various benchmarks. The code is

*Ahmed Sharshar,Yasser Ashraf,Tameem Bakr,Salma Hassan,Hosam Elgendy,Mohammad Yaqub,Mohsen Guizani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniBrain is a multimodal diagnostic framework for Alzheimer's disease, achieving high accuracy, generalization across datasets, and improved explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for scalable, reliable, and clinically acceptable diagnostics for Alzheimer's disease due to its growing prevalence and limitations in existing diagnostic methods.

Method: OmniBrain combines multimodal data, including MRI, radiomics, gene expression, and clinical data, using a unified model with cross-attention and modality dropout.

Result: OmniBrain achieved 92.2% accuracy on ANMerge dataset and 70.4% accuracy on the MRI-only ADNI dataset, surpassing prior diagnostic approaches.

Conclusion: OmniBrain is a robust, interpretable, and clinically viable approach for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease in real-world settings.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease affects over 55 million people worldwide and is projected
to more than double by 2050, necessitating rapid, accurate, and scalable
diagnostics. However, existing approaches are limited because they cannot
achieve clinically acceptable accuracy, generalization across datasets,
robustness to missing modalities, and explainability all at the same time. This
inability to satisfy all these requirements simultaneously undermines their
reliability in clinical settings. We propose OmniBrain, a multimodal framework
that integrates brain MRI, radiomics, gene expression, and clinical data using
a unified model with cross-attention and modality dropout. OmniBrain achieves
$92.2 \pm 2.4\%$accuracy on the ANMerge dataset and generalizes to the MRI-only
ADNI dataset with $70.4 \pm 2.7\%$ accuracy, outperforming unimodal and prior
multimodal approaches. Explainability analyses highlight neuropathologically
relevant brain regions and genes, enhancing clinical trust. OmniBrain offers a
robust, interpretable, and practical solution for real-world Alzheimer's
diagnosis.

TL;DR: DriveAgent-R1 introduces advanced reasoning for improved decision-making and perception in autonomous driving, addressing limitations in current Vision-Language Models. It outperforms state-of-the-art systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models for autonomous driving struggle with short-term thinking and passive perception, limiting their reliability in complex driving scenarios.

Method: DriveAgent-R1 employs a Hybrid-Thinking framework for adaptive reasoning, paired with Active Perception using a vision toolkit. It uses a unique progressive reinforcement learning strategy for training.

Result: DriveAgent-R1 achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal models, including proprietary systems, validated by extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Conclusion: The improvements in decision-making efficiency and reliability highlight DriveAgent-R1's significance in advancing safer and more intelligent autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing autonomous driving, yet their
potential is constrained by myopic decision-making and passive perception,
limiting reliability in complex environments. We introduce DriveAgent-R1 to
tackle these challenges in long-horizon, high-level behavioral decision-making.
DriveAgent-R1 features two core innovations: a Hybrid-Thinking framework that
adaptively switches between efficient text-based and in-depth tool-based
reasoning, and an Active Perception mechanism with a vision toolkit to
proactively resolve uncertainties, thereby balancing decision-making efficiency
and reliability. The agent is trained using a novel, three-stage progressive
reinforcement learning strategy designed to master these hybrid capabilities.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DriveAgent-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming even leading proprietary large multimodal models,
such as Claude Sonnet 4. Ablation studies validate our approach and confirm
that the agent's decisions are robustly grounded in actively perceived visual
evidence, paving a path toward safer and more intelligent autonomous systems.

TL;DR: The paper provides a comprehensive survey of deep learning-based endoscopic depth estimation methods, focusing on data, methods, applications, challenges, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a focused and updated survey on deep learning-based techniques for endoscopic depth estimation that are crucial for minimally invasive surgery.

Method: The paper systematically reviews state-of-the-art literature, categorizes techniques, analyzes challenges in endoscopic scenes, reviews robot-assisted surgery applications, and outlines future research directions.

Result: A detailed categorization of techniques based on supervision strategies and architectures, along with summarized performance metrics, publicly available datasets, and challenges in the field.

Conclusion: This survey highlights the importance of advancing deep learning techniques for endoscopic depth estimation, emphasizing future research directions in domain adaptation, real-time application, and generalization.

Abstract: Endoscopic depth estimation is a critical technology for improving the safety
and precision of minimally invasive surgery. It has attracted considerable
attention from researchers in medical imaging, computer vision, and robotics.
Over the past decade, a large number of methods have been developed. Despite
the existence of several related surveys, a comprehensive overview focusing on
recent deep learning-based techniques is still limited. This paper endeavors to
bridge this gap by systematically reviewing the state-of-the-art literature.
Specifically, we provide a thorough survey of the field from three key
perspectives: data, methods, and applications, covering a range of methods
including both monocular and stereo approaches. We describe common performance
evaluation metrics and summarize publicly available datasets. Furthermore, this
review analyzes the specific challenges of endoscopic scenes and categorizes
representative techniques based on their supervision strategies and network
architectures. The application of endoscopic depth estimation in the important
area of robot-assisted surgery is also reviewed. Finally, we outline potential
directions for future research, such as domain adaptation, real-time
implementation, and enhanced model generalization, thereby providing a valuable
starting point for researchers to engage with and advance the field.

### [293] [Event-Based De-Snowing for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20901)
*Manasi Muglikar,Nico Messikommer,Marco Cannici,Davide Scaramuzza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using event cameras to tackle image de-snowing challenges, achieving better reconstruction quality and improving performance in vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Snowfall creates significant visual challenges for both human and autonomous systems, and existing de-snowing methods are limited in handling these challenges effectively without introducing artifacts.

Method: The authors use event cameras and an attention-based module that identifies streak signatures from snowflake occlusions for precise image intensity recovery. They evaluate performance using DSEC-Snow, a new dataset with synchronized image and event streams.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms traditional methods, achieving a 3 dB improvement in PSNR for image reconstruction and a 20% increase in accuracy in depth estimation and optical flow tasks.

Conclusion: Event cameras are highly suitable for de-snowing applications, enabling robust vision systems for all-weather autonomy and enhancing safety in adverse winter conditions.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions, particularly heavy snowfall, pose significant
challenges to both human drivers and autonomous vehicles. Traditional
image-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they
rely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high
frame rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera
parameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,
making the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network
generalization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing
by using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with
submillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the
presence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions
appear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal
representation of event data. We design an attention-based module that focuses
on events along these streaks to determine when a background point was occluded
and use this information to recover its original intensity. We benchmark our
method on DSEC-Snow, a new dataset created using a green-screen technique that
overlays pre-recorded snowfall data onto the existing DSEC driving dataset,
resulting in precise ground truth and synchronized image and event streams. Our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art de-snowing methods by 3 dB in PSNR for
image reconstruction. Moreover, we show that off-the-shelf computer vision
algorithms can be applied to our reconstructions for tasks such as depth
estimation and optical flow, achieving a $20\%$ performance improvement over
other de-snowing methods. Our work represents a crucial step towards enhancing
the reliability and safety of vision systems in challenging winter conditions,
paving the way for more robust, all-weather-capable applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ensures model reliability across scanning devices using a novel dataset (SCORPION) and a consistency framework (SimCons).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle scanner-induced variability in computational pathology models, ensuring patient diagnosis accuracy across diverse devices.

Method: Introduced SCORPION dataset comprising aligned patches scanned by 5 different devices and SimCons framework combining data augmentation with a consistency loss for improved generalization.

Result: SimCons demonstrated enhanced scanner generalization capabilities while preserving task-specific performance.

Conclusion: SCORPION and SimCons set new standards in evaluating model reliability under scanner-induced variability and improve the generalization potential of computational pathology systems.

Abstract: Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical
challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in
Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus
calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world
adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per
institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on
scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis
and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on
standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during
training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same
tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset
explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability.
SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding
2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the
isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of
model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition.
Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines
augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to
explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons
improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising
task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing
SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for
evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a
new standard for reliability testing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HAMLET-FFD, a framework that improves cross-domain face forgery detection by integrating visual and textual cues, built upon the CLIP model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face manipulation techniques evolve rapidly, challenging conventional detection methods with poor cross-domain generalization.

Method: HAMLET-FFD employs a bidirectional cross-modal reasoning framework that integrates visual and textual embeddings with a knowledge refinement loop.

Result: HAMLET-FFD outperforms other methods in generalizing to unseen face manipulations across benchmarks.

Conclusion: This approach offers a cognitively inspired strategy and enhances face forgery detection through domain-invariant representation learning.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of face manipulation techniques poses a critical
challenge for face forgery detection: cross-domain generalization. Conventional
methods, which rely on simple classification objectives, often fail to learn
domain-invariant representations. We propose HAMLET-FFD, a cognitively inspired
Hierarchical Adaptive Multi-modal Learning framework that tackles this
challenge via bidirectional cross-modal reasoning. Building on contrastive
vision-language models such as CLIP, HAMLET-FFD introduces a knowledge
refinement loop that iteratively assesses authenticity by integrating visual
evidence with conceptual cues, emulating expert forensic analysis. A key
innovation is a bidirectional fusion mechanism in which textual authenticity
embeddings guide the aggregation of hierarchical visual features, while
modulated visual features refine text embeddings to generate image-adaptive
prompts. This closed-loop process progressively aligns visual observations with
semantic priors to enhance authenticity assessment. By design, HAMLET-FFD
freezes all pretrained parameters, serving as an external plugin that preserves
CLIP's original capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior
generalization to unseen manipulations across multiple benchmarks, and visual
analyses reveal a division of labor among embeddings, with distinct
representations specializing in fine-grained artifact recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces RIS-LAD, a benchmark dataset for Referring Image Segmentation in Low-Altitude Drone imagery featuring 13,871 annotated samples and proposes a Semantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network (SAARN) to address unique challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios has been underexplored, and existing methods fail to address challenges like diverse viewpoints, high object density, and small cluttered objects in LAD imagery.

Method: A fine-grained RIS dataset tailored for LAD scenarios was developed alongside Semantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network (SAARN), a model which routes semantic information differently across network stages.

Result: RIS-LAD dataset highlights challenges for existing RIS algorithms, while SAARN demonstrates improved effectiveness in handling LAD-specific complexities.

Conclusion: RIS-LAD provides substantial contributions to vision-language understanding in LAD contexts, offering new benchmarks and an effective model for advancing the field.

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), which aims to segment specific objects
based on natural language descriptions, plays an essential role in
vision-language understanding. Despite its progress in remote sensing
applications, RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios remains underexplored.
Existing datasets and methods are typically designed for high-altitude and
static-view imagery. They struggle to handle the unique characteristics of LAD
views, such as diverse viewpoints and high object density. To fill this gap, we
present RIS-LAD, the first fine-grained RIS benchmark tailored for LAD
scenarios. This dataset comprises 13,871 carefully annotated image-text-mask
triplets collected from realistic drone footage, with a focus on small,
cluttered, and multi-viewpoint scenes. It highlights new challenges absent in
previous benchmarks, such as category drift caused by tiny objects and object
drift under crowded same-class objects. To tackle these issues, we propose the
Semantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network (SAARN). Rather than uniformly
injecting all linguistic features, SAARN decomposes and routes semantic
information to different stages of the network. Specifically, the
Category-Dominated Linguistic Enhancement (CDLE) aligns visual features with
object categories during early encoding, while the Adaptive Reasoning Fusion
Module (ARFM) dynamically selects semantic cues across scales to improve
reasoning in complex scenes. The experimental evaluation reveals that RIS-LAD
presents substantial challenges to state-of-the-art RIS algorithms, and also
demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed model in addressing these
challenges. The dataset and code will be publicly released soon at:

*Melissa Cote,Alexandra Branzan Albu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study explores using text-to-image (T2I) generation to create query images for attribute-based document image retrieval (ABDIR), targeting historical documents and offering a bridge between ABDIR and query-by-example (QBE) methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional query-by-example (QBE) document retrieval methods require query documents, which might not always be available. Attribute-based document image retrieval (ABDIR) offers a flexible alternative by leveraging visual document attributes to aid in image retrieval. The authors aimed to explore generative AI, specifically T2I, to combine the strengths of ABDIR and QBE.

Method: The proposed method, T2I-QBE, utilizes a text-to-image generator, Leonardo.Ai, to create query images based on text prompts. These prompts describe desired document attributes and types, allowing for a hybrid ABDIR-QBE approach to retrieval using CNN-extracted document features.

Result: Experiments carried out on the HisIR19 dataset demonstrate that the T2I-QBE method is effective at retrieving historical document images based on their visual and attribute-based features.

Conclusion: The study confirms T2I-QBE's potential as a novel approach for historical document image retrieval and signifies the first attempt to integrate text-to-image generation into document retrieval methods.

Abstract: Attribute-based document image retrieval (ABDIR) was recently proposed as an
alternative to query-by-example (QBE) searches, the dominant document image
retrieval (DIR) paradigm. One drawback of QBE searches is that they require
sample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer
users a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual
features of document contents, describing document images with combinations of
visual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
binary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI
to bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a
use case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize
that text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document
images using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes. We propose T2I-QBE,
which uses Leonardo.Ai as the T2I generator with prompts that include a rough
description of the desired document type and a list of the desired ABDIR-style
attributes. This creates query images that are then used within the traditional
QBE paradigm, which compares CNN-extracted query features to those of the
document images in the dataset to retrieve the most relevant documents.
Experiments on the HisIR19 dataset of historical documents confirm our
hypothesis and suggest that T2I-QBE is a viable option for historical document
image retrieval. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt at
utilizing T2I generation for DIR.

Conclusion: ARC-Hunyuan-Video addresses short video comprehension challenges, offering high efficiency and versatility for real-world applications, which translates into enhanced video-based experiences and user satisfaction.

Abstract: Real-world user-generated short videos, especially those distributed on
platforms such as WeChat Channel and TikTok, dominate the mobile internet.
However, current large multimodal models lack essential temporally-structured,
detailed, and in-depth video comprehension capabilities, which are the
cornerstone of effective video search and recommendation, as well as emerging
video applications. Understanding real-world shorts is actually challenging due
to their complex visual elements, high information density in both visuals and
audio, and fast pacing that focuses on emotional expression and viewpoint
delivery. This requires advanced reasoning to effectively integrate multimodal
information, including visual, audio, and text. In this work, we introduce
ARC-Hunyuan-Video, a multimodal model that processes visual, audio, and textual
signals from raw video inputs end-to-end for structured comprehension. The
model is capable of multi-granularity timestamped video captioning and
summarization, open-ended video question answering, temporal video grounding,
and video reasoning. Leveraging high-quality data from an automated annotation
pipeline, our compact 7B-parameter model is trained through a comprehensive
regimen: pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, cold start, reinforcement
learning (RL) post-training, and final instruction fine-tuning. Quantitative
evaluations on our introduced benchmark ShortVid-Bench and qualitative
comparisons demonstrate its strong performance in real-world video
comprehension, and it supports zero-shot or fine-tuning with a few samples for
diverse downstream applications. The real-world production deployment of our
model has yielded tangible and measurable improvements in user engagement and
satisfaction, a success supported by its remarkable efficiency, with stress
tests indicating an inference time of just 10 seconds for a one-minute video on
H20 GPU.

### [299] [Mask-Free Audio-driven Talking Face Generation for Enhanced Visual Quality and Identity Preservation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20953)
*Dogucan Yaman,Fevziye Irem Eyiokur,Leonard Bärmann,Hazım Kemal Ekenel,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new approach for Audio-Driven Talking Face Generation by transforming input images with closed mouths instead of masking, avoiding reliance on identity reference images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current masking-based methods in talking face generation, such as information loss, reconstruction issues, and unintended copying of non-audio-aligned elements.

Method: The method uses a two-step landmark-based transformation to create closed-mouth input images, trains the approach in an unpaired manner, and utilizes a lip adaptation model to generate lip movements driven by audio.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets LRS2 and HDTF show improved performance over traditional masking approaches, with validation through multiple ablation studies.

Conclusion: The proposed mask-free approach preserves visual details and identity, avoids reliance on additional identity reference images, and improves audio-lip synchronization quality.

Abstract: Audio-Driven Talking Face Generation aims at generating realistic videos of
talking faces, focusing on accurate audio-lip synchronization without
deteriorating any identity-related visual details. Recent state-of-the-art
methods are based on inpainting, meaning that the lower half of the input face
is masked, and the model fills the masked region by generating lips aligned
with the given audio. Hence, to preserve identity-related visual details from
the lower half, these approaches additionally require an unmasked identity
reference image randomly selected from the same video. However, this common
masking strategy suffers from (1) information loss in the input faces,
significantly affecting the networks' ability to preserve visual quality and
identity details, (2) variation between identity reference and input image
degrading reconstruction performance, and (3) the identity reference negatively
impacting the model, causing unintended copying of elements unaligned with the
audio. To address these issues, we propose a mask-free talking face generation
approach while maintaining the 2D-based face editing task. Instead of masking
the lower half, we transform the input images to have closed mouths, using a
two-step landmark-based approach trained in an unpaired manner. Subsequently,
we provide these edited but unmasked faces to a lip adaptation model alongside
the audio to generate appropriate lip movements. Thus, our approach needs
neither masked input images nor identity reference images. We conduct
experiments on the benchmark LRS2 and HDTF datasets and perform various
ablation studies to validate our contributions.

### [300] [GTAD: Global Temporal Aggregation Denoising Learning for 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20963)
*Tianhao Li,Yang Li,Mengtian Li,Yisheng Deng,Weifeng Ge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GTAD, a network to better utilize both local and global temporal information for 3D scene understanding in dynamic environments, showing improved results in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for perceiving dynamic environments inadequately leverage global temporal sequence information, focusing too much on local interactions between adjacent frames.

Method: GTAD introduces a global temporal aggregation framework with an in-model latent denoising network to combine local and global temporal features from historical sequences.

Result: The GTAD model outperforms existing approaches in comprehensively understanding environments, validated through experiments and ablation studies on nuScenes and Occ3D-nuScenes benchmarks.

Conclusion: GTAD effectively captures both fine-grained local and large-scale global temporal features, providing significant advantages in dynamic 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Accurately perceiving dynamic environments is a fundamental task for
autonomous driving and robotic systems. Existing methods inadequately utilize
temporal information, relying mainly on local temporal interactions between
adjacent frames and failing to leverage global sequence information
effectively. To address this limitation, we investigate how to effectively
aggregate global temporal features from temporal sequences, aiming to achieve
occupancy representations that efficiently utilize global temporal information
from historical observations. For this purpose, we propose a global temporal
aggregation denoising network named GTAD, introducing a global temporal
information aggregation framework as a new paradigm for holistic 3D scene
understanding. Our method employs an in-model latent denoising network to
aggregate local temporal features from the current moment and global temporal
features from historical sequences. This approach enables the effective
perception of both fine-grained temporal information from adjacent frames and
global temporal patterns from historical observations. As a result, it provides
a more coherent and comprehensive understanding of the environment. Extensive
experiments on the nuScenes and Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark and ablation studies
demonstrate the superiority of our method.

*Xiao Fang,Minhyek Jeon,Zheyang Qin,Stanislav Panev,Celso de Melo,Shuowen Hu,Shayok Chakraborty,Fernando De la Torre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a generative AI-based data augmentation method to improve aerial vehicle detection, addressing domain shifts across geographic regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for vehicle detection in aerial imagery face challenges due to domain shifts caused by geographic variability and environmental factors.

Method: The authors developed a multi-stage, multi-modal framework using fine-tuned latent diffusion models (LDMs) to synthesize high-quality aerial images and labels, enabling enhanced detector training.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing approaches, achieving significant AP50 performance improvements across diverse domains: 4-23% over supervised learning, 6-10% over weakly supervised methods, 7-40% over unsupervised adaptation methods, and 50%+ over open-set detectors.

Conclusion: Generative AI can effectively bridge domain gaps in aerial vehicle detection. The paper also introduces two new datasets from New Zealand and Utah to aid further research.

Abstract: Detecting vehicles in aerial imagery is a critical task with applications in
traffic monitoring, urban planning, and defense intelligence. Deep learning
methods have provided state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for this application.
However, a significant challenge arises when models trained on data from one
geographic region fail to generalize effectively to other areas. Variability in
factors such as environmental conditions, urban layouts, road networks, vehicle
types, and image acquisition parameters (e.g., resolution, lighting, and angle)
leads to domain shifts that degrade model performance. This paper proposes a
novel method that uses generative AI to synthesize high-quality aerial images
and their labels, improving detector training through data augmentation. Our
key contribution is the development of a multi-stage, multi-modal knowledge
transfer framework utilizing fine-tuned latent diffusion models (LDMs) to
mitigate the distribution gap between the source and target environments.
Extensive experiments across diverse aerial imagery domains show consistent
performance improvements in AP50 over supervised learning on source domain
data, weakly supervised adaptation methods, unsupervised domain adaptation
methods, and open-set object detectors by 4-23%, 6-10%, 7-40%, and more than
50%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce two newly annotated aerial
datasets from New Zealand and Utah to support further research in this field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces JWB-DH-V1, a large-scale dataset and evaluation protocol to address shortcomings in multi-modal video and audio generation methods for whole-body talking avatars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation methods fail to achieve consistent whole-body and audio generation while lacking comprehensive evaluation frameworks.

Method: Created a dataset with 10,000 unique identities across 2 million video samples and an evaluation protocol focusing on joint audio-video generation performance.

Result: State-of-the-art models show performance gaps between face/hand-centric and whole-body generation.

Conclusion: JWB-DH-V1 provides crucial resources for benchmarking and research in multi-modal whole-body talking avatar generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have enabled
photo-realistic short clips, but current methods still struggle to achieve
multi-modal consistency when jointly generating whole-body motion and natural
speech. Current approaches lack comprehensive evaluation frameworks that assess
both visual and audio quality, and there are insufficient benchmarks for
region-specific performance analysis. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Joint Whole-Body Talking Avatar and Speech Generation Version I(JWB-DH-V1),
comprising a large-scale multi-modal dataset with 10,000 unique identities
across 2 million video samples, and an evaluation protocol for assessing joint
audio-video generation of whole-body animatable avatars. Our evaluation of SOTA
models reveals consistent performance disparities between face/hand-centric and
whole-body performance, which incidates essential areas for future research.

### [303] [Security Tensors as a Cross-Modal Bridge: Extending Text-Aligned Safety to Vision in LVLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20994)
*Shen Li,Liuyi Yao,Wujia Niu,Lan Zhang,Yaliang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the safety gap in large visual-language models (LVLMs) when dealing with harmful visual inputs by introducing trainable security tensors, which improve safety alignment for the visual modality without modifying the model’s parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs, while aligning large language models (LLMs) with visual processing, lack effective safety mechanisms for harmful visual inputs, creating a critical cross-modal safety gap.

Method: The study introduces security tensors—trainable input vectors applied at inference—which are optimized using a dataset of malicious, contrastive benign, and generally benign image-text pairs to transfer safety alignment from the text modality to visual processing.

Result: Experimental results show that the use of security tensors improves LVLMs' ability to reject harmful visual inputs while preserving performance on benign tasks. Hidden-layer analysis confirms these tensors enable the activation of textual safety layers during visual processing.

Conclusion: Security tensors effectively bridge the safety gap by extending text-based safety mechanisms to the visual modality in LVLMs without altering model parameters.

Abstract: Large visual-language models (LVLMs) integrate aligned large language models
(LLMs) with visual modules to process multimodal inputs. However, the safety
mechanisms developed for text-based LLMs do not naturally extend to visual
modalities, leaving LVLMs vulnerable to harmful image inputs. To address this
cross-modal safety gap, we introduce security tensors - trainable input vectors
applied during inference through either the textual or visual modality. These
tensors transfer textual safety alignment to visual processing without
modifying the model's parameters. They are optimized using a curated dataset
containing (i) malicious image-text pairs requiring rejection, (ii) contrastive
benign pairs with text structurally similar to malicious queries, with the
purpose of being contrastive examples to guide visual reliance, and (iii)
general benign samples preserving model functionality. Experimental results
demonstrate that both textual and visual security tensors significantly enhance
LVLMs' ability to reject diverse harmful visual inputs while maintaining
near-identical performance on benign tasks. Further internal analysis towards
hidden-layer representations reveals that security tensors successfully
activate the language module's textual "safety layers" in visual inputs,
thereby effectively extending text-based safety to the visual modality.

### [304] [Improving Adversarial Robustness Through Adaptive Learning-Driven Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20996)
*Hayat Ullah,Syed Muhammad Talha Zaidi,Arslan Munir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-teacher adversarial robustness distillation approach to enhance CNN models' resistance to adversarial attacks using adaptive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs excel in computer vision yet face vulnerabilities in adversarial attacks. Despite progress in adversarial training, there remains a trade-off between model accuracy and robustness.

Method: Train multiple CNN teacher models adversarially using diverse attacks, then distill their knowledge into a student model on clean data using adaptive learning that weights contributions based on prediction precision.

Result: Experimental evaluation on MNIST-Digits and Fashion-MNIST datasets demonstrates significant adversarial robustness improvements for the student model.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-teacher distillation method, with adaptive learning, effectively enhances CNN models' robustness against adversarial attacks without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel in computer vision but are
susceptible to adversarial attacks, crafted perturbations designed to mislead
predictions. Despite advances in adversarial training, a gap persists between
model accuracy and robustness. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we
present a multi-teacher adversarial robustness distillation using an adaptive
learning strategy. Specifically, our proposed method first trained multiple
clones of a baseline CNN model using an adversarial training strategy on a pool
of perturbed data acquired through different adversarial attacks. Once trained,
these adversarially trained models are used as teacher models to supervise the
learning of a student model on clean data using multi-teacher knowledge
distillation. To ensure an effective robustness distillation, we design an
adaptive learning strategy that controls the knowledge contribution of each
model by assigning weights as per their prediction precision. Distilling
knowledge from adversarially pre-trained teacher models not only enhances the
learning capabilities of the student model but also empowers it with the
capacity to withstand different adversarial attacks, despite having no exposure
to adversarial data. To verify our claims, we extensively evaluated our
proposed method on MNIST-Digits and Fashion-MNIST datasets across diverse
experimental settings. The obtained results exhibit the efficacy of our
multi-teacher adversarial distillation and adaptive learning strategy,
enhancing CNNs' adversarial robustness against various adversarial attacks.

### [305] [Learning Transferable Facial Emotion Representations from Large-Scale Semantically Rich Captions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21015)
*Licai Sun,Xingxun Jiang,Haoyu Chen,Yante Li,Zheng Lian,Biu Liu,Yuan Zong,Wenming Zheng,Jukka M. Leppänen,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a large-scale dataset, EmoCap100K, and a framework, EmoCapCLIP, for learning facial emotion representations using rich natural language captions. The approach outperforms existing methods across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing facial emotion recognition systems are limited by reliance on predefined categorical labels or dimensional values, which oversimplify the complexity of emotions. Natural language offers a richer, more expressive supervisory source for emotion representation learning, but its application has been hindered by data and framework limitations.

Method: The paper introduces EmoCap100K, a dataset with over 100,000 facial emotion captions, and proposes EmoCapCLIP, a joint global-local contrastive learning framework with a cross-modal guided positive mining module. This enables the effective use of hierarchical caption information and recognition of semantically similar expressions.

Result: Extensive evaluations on more than 20 benchmarks spanning five tasks reveal that EmoCapCLIP achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the advantages of leveraging semantically rich natural language captions for facial emotion representation learning, offering improved generalization and applicability. The dataset and code are made publicly available.

Abstract: Current facial emotion recognition systems are predominately trained to
predict a fixed set of predefined categories or abstract dimensional values.
This constrained form of supervision hinders generalization and applicability,
as it reduces the rich and nuanced spectrum of emotions into oversimplified
labels or scales. In contrast, natural language provides a more flexible,
expressive, and interpretable way to represent emotions, offering a much
broader source of supervision. Yet, leveraging semantically rich natural
language captions as supervisory signals for facial emotion representation
learning remains relatively underexplored, primarily due to two key challenges:
1) the lack of large-scale caption datasets with rich emotional semantics, and
2) the absence of effective frameworks tailored to harness such rich
supervision. To this end, we introduce EmoCap100K, a large-scale facial emotion
caption dataset comprising over 100,000 samples, featuring rich and structured
semantic descriptions that capture both global affective states and
fine-grained local facial behaviors. Building upon this dataset, we further
propose EmoCapCLIP, which incorporates a joint global-local contrastive
learning framework enhanced by a cross-modal guided positive mining module.
This design facilitates the comprehensive exploitation of multi-level caption
information while accommodating semantic similarities between closely related
expressions. Extensive evaluations on over 20 benchmarks covering five tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting the promise of
learning facial emotion representations from large-scale semantically rich
captions. The code and data will be available at
https://github.com/sunlicai/EmoCapCLIP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a benchmarking framework for automated rehabilitation assessment using deep learning, aggregates datasets into Rehab-Pile, and provides open datasets and code for reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for objective and accessible motion quality assessment in rehabilitation, addressing the lack of standardized benchmarks and reproducible methods.

Method: The study aggregates datasets into a single archive (Rehab-Pile), proposes a benchmarking framework, and benchmarks multiple architectures for classification and regression tasks.

Result: A unified archive of datasets, a benchmarking framework, and extensive evaluations of deep learning methods were presented and made publicly available.

Conclusion: The work lays a foundation for future research in automated rehabilitation motion assessment and promotes transparency, accessibility, and personalizability in this area.

Abstract: Automated assessment of human motion plays a vital role in rehabilitation,
enabling objective evaluation of patient performance and progress. Unlike
general human activity recognition, rehabilitation motion assessment focuses on
analyzing the quality of movement within the same action class, requiring the
detection of subtle deviations from ideal motion. Recent advances in deep
learning and video-based skeleton extraction have opened new possibilities for
accessible, scalable motion assessment using affordable devices such as
smartphones or webcams. However, the field lacks standardized benchmarks,
consistent evaluation protocols, and reproducible methodologies, limiting
progress and comparability across studies. In this work, we address these gaps
by (i) aggregating existing rehabilitation datasets into a unified archive
called Rehab-Pile, (ii) proposing a general benchmarking framework for
evaluating deep learning methods in this domain, and (iii) conducting extensive
benchmarking of multiple architectures across classification and regression
tasks. All datasets and implementations are released to the community to
support transparency and reproducibility. This paper aims to establish a solid
foundation for future research in automated rehabilitation assessment and
foster the development of reliable, accessible, and personalized rehabilitation
solutions. The datasets, source-code and results of this article are all
publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M, a large-scale, open-source dataset aimed at advancing instruction-guided image editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprietary constraints on state-of-the-art multimodal models limit open-source research in high-quality instruction-based image editing.

Method: The dataset combines and refines three popular image-editing datasets (OmniEdit, HQ-Edit, UltraEdit) using GPT-4o capabilities, improving output image quality and prompt clarity.

Result: Fine-tuned models on GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M exhibit competitive performance, surpassing existing open-source methods across key benchmarks and approaching proprietary model accuracy.

Conclusion: The release of GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M is aimed at advancing open research while narrowing the performance gap with proprietary solutions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models like GPT-4o have set a new
standard for high-fidelity, instruction-guided image editing. However, the
proprietary nature of these models and their training data creates a
significant barrier for open-source research. To bridge this gap, we introduce
GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M, a publicly available, large-scale image-editing corpus
containing more than 1.5 million high-quality triplets (instruction, source
image, edited image). We systematically construct this dataset by leveraging
the versatile capabilities of GPT-4o to unify and refine three popular
image-editing datasets: OmniEdit, HQ-Edit, and UltraEdit. Specifically, our
methodology involves 1) regenerating output images to enhance visual quality
and instruction alignment, and 2) selectively rewriting prompts to improve
semantic clarity. To validate the efficacy of our dataset, we fine-tune
advanced open-source models on GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M. The empirical results are
exciting, e.g., the fine-tuned FluxKontext achieves highly competitive
performance across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, including 7.24 on
GEdit-EN, 3.80 on ImgEdit-Full, and 8.78 on Complex-Edit, showing stronger
instruction following and higher perceptual quality while maintaining identity.
These scores markedly exceed all previously published open-source methods and
substantially narrow the gap to leading proprietary models. We hope the full
release of GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M can help to catalyze further open research in
instruction-guided image editing.

TL;DR: This paper surveys methods for reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual data, organizing them into five progressive levels of complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of a comprehensive, hierarchical analysis of methods for 4D scene reconstruction, a critical area in computer vision with wide-ranging applications.

Method: They introduce a framework that classifies existing methods into five levels of 4D spatial intelligence, from basic 3D attributes to advanced physical modeling.

Result: The paper organizes and analyzes current methods within their proposed framework, identifying challenges and promising research directions specific to each level.

Conclusion: The authors highlight the need for further innovation to achieve higher levels of 4D spatial intelligence and provide a resource for ongoing developments in the field.

Abstract: Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has long been
a central yet challenging task in computer vision, with broad real-world
applications. These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the
focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI,
which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid
advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has
evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally,
existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical
structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new
perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D
spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes
(e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene
components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction
of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene
components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints.
We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and
highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D
spatial intelligence. To track ongoing developments, we maintain an up-to-date

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper explores dynamic server allocation policies in cloud computing and compares simple policies with optimal ones using analytic and semi-Markov decision models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud computing demands efficient resource management to handle varying load conditions dynamically.

Method: The paper proposes simple policies for server allocation, analyzes them using models, and applies semi-Markov decision models to determine the optimal performance.

Result: The study quantifies the performance gap between simple and optimal policies and assesses the benefits of state-dependent routing in multi-site systems.

Conclusion: The insights help service providers optimize costs and delays in cloud services through better server allocation practices.

Abstract: Cloud computing enables the dynamic provisioning of server resources. To
exploit this opportunity, a policy is needed for dynamically allocating (and
deallocating) servers in response to the current load conditions. In this paper
we describe several simple policies for dynamic server allocation and develop
analytic models for their analysis. We also design semi-Markov decision models
that enable determination of the performance achieved with optimal policies,
allowing us to quantify the performance gap between simple, easily implemented
policies, and optimal policies. Finally, we apply our models to study the
potential performance benefits of state-dependent routing in multi-site systems
when using dynamic server allocation at each site. Insights from our results
are valuable to service providers wanting to balance cloud service costs and
delays.

*Jonas H. Müller Korndörfer,Ali Mohammed,Ahmed Eleliemy,Quentin Guilloteau,Reto Krummenacher,Florina M. Ciorba*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper explores learning-based methods, combining reinforcement learning and expert knowledge, to dynamically optimize scheduling algorithm selection in OpenMP, enhancing adaptability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing complexity in scientific and data science applications and optimize scheduling performance in high performance computing (HPC) environments.

Method: The authors propose expert-based and reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods to dynamically select scheduling algorithms in OpenMP, evaluating performance across six applications and three systems.

Result: RL methods show high-performing schedules but require significant exploration, while expert-based methods rely on prior knowledge with less exploration but may not always be optimal. Combining both approaches improves performance and adaptability.

Conclusion: Dynamic scheduling algorithm selection using learning-based methods is practical and beneficial for OpenMP applications, and the approach can extend to MPI-based programs, optimizing multi-level parallelism.

Abstract: Scientific and data science applications are becoming increasingly complex,
with growing computational and memory demands. Modern high performance
computing (HPC) systems provide high parallelism and heterogeneity across
nodes, devices, and cores. To achieve good performance, effective scheduling
and load balancing techniques are essential. Parallel programming frameworks
such as OpenMP now offer a variety of advanced scheduling algorithms to support
diverse applications and platforms. This creates an instance of the scheduling
algorithm selection problem, which involves identifying the most suitable
algorithm for a given combination of workload and system characteristics.
  In this work, we explore learning-based approaches for selecting scheduling
algorithms in OpenMP. We propose and evaluate expert-based and reinforcement
learning (RL)-based methods, and conduct a detailed performance analysis across
six applications and three systems. Our results show that RL methods are
capable of learning high-performing scheduling decisions, although they require
significant exploration, with the choice of reward function playing a key role.
Expert-based methods, in contrast, rely on prior knowledge and involve less
exploration, though they may not always identify the optimal algorithm for a
specific application-system pair. By combining expert knowledge with RL-based
learning, we achieve improved performance and greater adaptability.
  Overall, this work demonstrates that dynamic selection of scheduling
algorithms during execution is both viable and beneficial for OpenMP
applications. The approach can also be extended to MPI-based programs, enabling
optimization of scheduling decisions across multiple levels of parallelism.

TL;DR: This paper explores optimizing mission assignment and task offloading for autonomous vehicles within Open RAN-based intelligent transportation systems using a novel system model (Oranits) and advanced optimization algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current studies lack consideration for mission dependencies and offloading costs, resulting in suboptimal decision-making in autonomous vehicle systems within dynamic ITS environments.

Method: The study introduces Oranits, combining a metaheuristic-based algorithm (CGG-ARO) for one-slot optimization and a Multi-agent Double Deep Q-Network (MA-DDQN) for enhanced reward-based deep reinforcement learning to optimize performance.

Result: The paper reports that CGG-ARO improves mission completions by 7.1% and overall benefit by 7.7%, while MA-DDQN achieves even higher enhancements of 11.0% in mission completions and 12.5% in overall benefit.

Conclusion: Oranits significantly enhances mission assignment and task offloading efficiency, showcasing its potential for faster and more adaptive processing in intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore mission assignment and task offloading in an Open
Radio Access Network (Open RAN)-based intelligent transportation system (ITS),
where autonomous vehicles leverage mobile edge computing for efficient
processing. Existing studies often overlook the intricate interdependencies
between missions and the costs associated with offloading tasks to edge
servers, leading to suboptimal decision-making. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Oranits, a novel system model that explicitly accounts for mission
dependencies and offloading costs while optimizing performance through vehicle
cooperation. To achieve this, we propose a twofold optimization approach.
First, we develop a metaheuristic-based evolutionary computing algorithm,
namely the Chaotic Gaussian-based Global ARO (CGG-ARO), serving as a baseline
for one-slot optimization. Second, we design an enhanced reward-based deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, referred to as the Multi-agent Double
Deep Q-Network (MA-DDQN), that integrates both multi-agent coordination and
multi-action selection mechanisms, significantly reducing mission assignment
time and improving adaptability over baseline methods. Extensive simulations
reveal that CGG-ARO improves the number of completed missions and overall
benefit by approximately 7.1% and 7.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, MA-DDQN
achieves even greater improvements of 11.0% in terms of mission completions and
12.5% in terms of the overall benefit. These results highlight the
effectiveness of Oranits in enabling faster, more adaptive, and more efficient
task processing in dynamic ITS environments.

TL;DR: This study analyzes the performance of matrix multiplication on consumer-grade hardware, comparing a sequential CPU, parallel CPU (OpenMP), and parallel GPU (CUDA) implementation, showing significant speedups, especially for the GPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Matrix multiplication is computationally expensive and a bottleneck for large-scale applications, necessitating optimization techniques on parallel hardware like GPUs and multi-core CPUs, even for consumer hardware.

Method: Three algorithms for matrix multiplication were implemented: a sequential CPU version in C++, a parallel CPU version using OpenMP, and a GPU version using CUDA with shared memory optimization. These were tested on square matrices of sizes from 128x128 to 4096x4096.

Result: The CPU parallel implementation achieved a 12-14x speedup over the sequential baseline, while the GPU implementation achieved up to 593x speedup over the sequential baseline and 45x over the parallel CPU for the largest tested matrices.

Conclusion: Many-core GPU architectures offer dramatic performance improvements for data-parallel tasks like matrix multiplication, with consumer-grade devices capable of achieving significant acceleration on large-scale workloads.

Abstract: Matrix multiplication is a foundational operation in scientific computing and
machine learning, yet its computational complexity makes it a significant
bottleneck for large-scale applications. The shift to parallel architectures,
primarily multi-core CPUs and many-core GPUs, is the established solution, and
these systems are now ubiquitous from datacenters to consumer laptops. This
paper presents a direct, empirical performance analysis of matrix
multiplication on a modern, consumer-grade heterogeneous platform. We
implemented and benchmarked three versions of the algorithm: a baseline
sequential C++ implementation, a parallel version for its multi-core CPU using
OpenMP, and a massively parallel version for its discrete GPU using CUDA with
shared memory optimizations. The implementations were evaluated with square
matrices of varying dimensions, from 128x128 to 4096x4096. Our results show
that while the parallel CPU provides a consistent speedup of 12-14x over the
sequential version, the GPU's performance scales dramatically with problem
size. For a 4096x4096 matrix, the GPU implementation achieved a speedup of
approximately 593x over the sequential baseline and 45x over the optimized
parallel CPU version. These findings quantitatively demonstrate the profound
impact of many-core GPU architectures on accelerating data-parallel workloads,
underscoring that significant performance gains are readily accessible even on
consumer-level hardware.

TL;DR: MegatronApp is an open-source toolchain aimed at addressing system-level challenges in training large language models (LLMs), enhancing reliability, efficiency, and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle system-level challenges like optimization, diagnosis, and interpretability in training trillion-parameter large language models.

Method: Introduced an open-source toolchain with four composable modules (MegaScan, MegaFBD, MegaDPP, MegaScope) to elevate training capabilities and integrate synergistically with Megatron-LM.

Result: The four modules collectively improve the performance, diagnostic capabilities, and interpretability of production-scale training.

Conclusion: MegatronApp provides a systematic solution for enhancing the Megatron-LM ecosystem, addressing scalability and reliability in LLM training workflows.

Abstract: The rapid escalation in the parameter count of large language models (LLMs)
has transformed model training from a single-node endeavor into a highly
intricate, cross-node activity. While frameworks such as Megatron-LM
successfully integrate tensor (TP), pipeline (PP), and data (DP) parallelism to
enable trillion-parameter training, they simultaneously expose practitioners to
unprecedented systems-level challenges in performance optimization, diagnosis,
and interpretability. MegatronApp is an open-source toolchain expressly
designed to meet these challenges. It introduces four orthogonal, yet
seamlessly composable modules--MegaScan, MegaFBD, MegaDPP, and MegaScope--that
collectively elevate the reliability, efficiency, and transparency of
production-scale training. This paper presents the motivation, architecture,
and distinctive contributions of each module, and elucidates how their
synergistic integration augments the Megatron-LM ecosystem.

### [314] [A Fast Parallel Median Filtering Algorithm Using Hierarchical Tiling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19926)
*Louis Sugy*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel median filtering algorithm leveraging hierarchical tiling, achieving unprecedented efficiency with a CUDA implementation up to 5x faster than current methods on GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost of median filtering, especially with increasing kernel sizes, presents a challenge in digital image processing, necessitating a more efficient approach.

Method: Two algorithm variants are proposed: a data-oblivious selection network for on-register operations, and a data-aware method utilizing RAM. These yield per-pixel complexities of O(k log(k)) and O(k), respectively, leveraging hierarchical tiling to reduce redundant computations.

Result: The presented algorithms outperform existing state-of-the-art approaches, with the CUDA implementation demonstrating up to 5x speed improvements across various data types and kernel sizes.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms significantly enhance the scalability and performance of median filtering, setting a new standard in computational efficiency for image processing tasks.

Abstract: Median filtering is a non-linear smoothing technique widely used in digital
image processing to remove noise while retaining sharp edges. It is
particularly well suited to removing outliers (impulse noise) or granular
artifacts (speckle noise). However, the high computational cost of median
filtering can be prohibitive. Sorting-based algorithms excel with small kernels
but scale poorly with increasing kernel diameter, in contrast to constant-time
methods characterized by higher constant factors but better scalability, such
as histogram-based approaches or the 2D wavelet matrix.
  This paper introduces a novel algorithm, leveraging the separability of the
sorting problem through hierarchical tiling to minimize redundant computations.
We propose two variants: a data-oblivious selection network that can operate
entirely within registers, and a data-aware version utilizing random-access
memory. These achieve per-pixel complexities of $O(k \log(k))$ and $O(k)$,
respectively, for a $k \times k$ kernel - unprecedented for sorting-based
methods. Our CUDA implementation is up to 5 times faster than the current state
of the art on a modern GPU and is the fastest median filter in most cases for
8-, 16-, and 32-bit data types and kernels from $3 \times 3$ to $75 \times 75$.

*David Jannis Schmidt,Grigory Fridman,Florian von Zabiensky*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper develops a cloud-based architecture for real-time system tracing, leveraging edge computing and scalable backend tools like WebSockets and Apache Kafka for efficient analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time embedded systems demand precise timing and fault detection, but traditional tracing tools on developers' desktops are limited in scalability and storage.

Method: A cloud-based architecture using microservices is introduced. It includes a dedicated tracing component to capture and forward data to a scalable cloud backend via WebSockets and Apache Kafka.

Result: The architecture efficiently handles many parallel tracing sessions, showcasing its scalability. However, per-session throughput slightly diminishes with increased system load.

Conclusion: The approach enables collaborative, scalable tracing for both development and runtime monitoring, bridging gaps in traditional desktop-based tracing tools.

Abstract: Real-time embedded systems require precise timing and fault detection to
ensure correct behavior. Traditional tracing tools often rely on local desktops
with limited processing and storage capabilities, which hampers large-scale
analysis. This paper presents a scalable, cloud-based architecture for software
tracing in real-time systems based on microservices and edge computing. Our
approach shifts the trace processing workload from the developer's machine to
the cloud, using a dedicated tracing component that captures trace data and
forwards it to a scalable backend via WebSockets and Apache Kafka. This enables
long-term monitoring and collaborative analysis of target executions, e.g., to
detect and investigate sporadic errors. We demonstrate how this architecture
supports scalable analysis of parallel tracing sessions and lays the foundation
for future integration of rule-based testing and runtime verification. The
evaluation results show that the architecture can handle many parallel tracing
sessions efficiently, although the per-session throughput decreases slightly as
the system load increases, while the overall throughput increases. Although the
design includes a dedicated tracer for analysis during development, this
approach is not limited to such setups. Target systems with network
connectivity can stream reduced trace data directly, enabling runtime
monitoring in the field.

*Daniel Manor,Mor Perry,Moshe Sulamy*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: MTASet uses a concurrent (a,b)-tree to improve performance for update-heavy tasks and atomic range queries, achieving up to 2x efficiency compared to existing concurrent set implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current concurrent set implementations are either optimized for read-heavy operations or lack efficiency for atomic range queries in update-heavy workloads.

Method: The study proposes MTASet, a concurrent (a,b)-tree designed to balance update-heavy operations with efficient atomic range queries while ensuring linearizability.

Result: MTASet outperforms existing concurrent set solutions for range query operations, achieving up to 2x improvement in performance.

Conclusion: MTASet effectively addresses the deficiencies of current implementations, providing a robust solution for workloads that demand efficient updates and atomic range queries.

Abstract: In concurrent data structures, the efficiency of set operations can vary
significantly depending on the workload characteristics. Numerous concurrent
set implementations are optimized and fine-tuned to excel in scenarios
characterized by predominant read operations. However, they often perform
poorly when confronted with workloads that heavily prioritize updates.
Additionally, current leading-edge concurrent sets optimized for update-heavy
tasks typically lack efficiency in handling atomic range queries. This study
introduces the MTASet, which leverages a concurrent (a,b)-tree implementation.
Engineered to accommodate update-heavy workloads and facilitate atomic range
queries, MTASet surpasses existing counterparts optimized for tasks in range
query operations by up to 2x. Notably, MTASet ensures linearizability.

*Mufakir Qamar Ansari,Mudabir Qamar Ansari*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The study examines performance and energy efficiency across multi-core CPUs and GPUs (both discrete and integrated) in matrix-matrix multiplication within a consumer-grade laptop. Discrete GPUs are found to be the fastest and most energy-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for energy-efficient design in high-performance computing (HPC) due to power and thermal limitations of single-core processors.

Method: Empirical measurement of performance and energy usage on a 4096x4096 matrix-matrix multiplication workload using tools like Linux perf and nvidia-smi on three distinct compute architectures.

Result: Discrete GPU attained a 93.5x performance speedup and consumed significantly less energy—only 2% of CPU consumption—leading to a 50x energy-efficiency improvement.

Conclusion: Discrete GPUs demonstrate superior performance and energy efficiency within heterogeneous systems, offering practical insights into energy-aware architectural decisions.

Abstract: The paradigm shift towards multi-core and heterogeneous computing, driven by
the fundamental power and thermal limits of single-core processors, has
established energy efficiency as a first-class design constraint in
high-performance computing (HPC). Heterogeneous systems, integrating
traditional multi-core CPUs with specialized accelerators like discrete (dGPU)
and integrated (iGPU) graphics processing units, offer a compelling path to
navigating the trade-offs between performance and power. However, quantifying
these trade-offs on widely accessible hardware remains a critical area of
study. This paper presents a direct, empirical measurement of the performance
and energy-to-solution of a canonical HPC workload -- a 4096x4096 matrix-matrix
multiplication -- on three distinct compute architectures within a single
consumer-grade laptop: a multi-core AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU, a discrete NVIDIA
GeForce GTX 1650 GPU, and an integrated AMD Radeon Vega GPU. Using standard,
validated, and minimally intrusive tools such as Linux perf and nvidia-smi, we
find that the discrete GPU is not only the performance leader, achieving a
93.5x speedup over the CPU, but is also the most energy-efficient, consuming
only 2% of the energy used by the CPU, resulting in a 50-fold improvement in
energy efficiency. These findings provide a practical demonstration of the
"race to idle" principle and offer clear, quantitative guidance on
architectural choices for energy-aware software development.

Abstract: This paper presents an in-depth investigation into the high-performance
parallel optimization of the Fish School Behaviour (FSB) algorithm on the
Setonix supercomputing platform using the OpenMP framework. Given the
increasing demand for enhanced computational capabilities for complex,
large-scale calculations across diverse domains, there's an imperative need for
optimized parallel algorithms and computing structures. The FSB algorithm,
inspired by nature's social behavior patterns, provides an ideal platform for
parallelization due to its iterative and computationally intensive nature. This
study leverages the capabilities of the Setonix platform and the OpenMP
framework to analyze various aspects of multi-threading, such as thread counts,
scheduling strategies, and OpenMP constructs, aiming to discern patterns and
strategies that can elevate program performance. Experiments were designed to
rigorously test different configurations, and our results not only offer
insights for parallel optimization of FSB on Setonix but also provide valuable
references for other parallel computational research using OpenMP. Looking
forward, other factors, such as cache behavior and thread scheduling strategies
at micro and macro levels, hold potential for further exploration and
optimization.

### [319] [Ethereum Conflicts Graphed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20196)
*Dvir David Biton,Roy Friedman,Yaron Hay*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper examines Ethereum smart contract interactions and transactions using a call tracer, analyzing conflict graph properties and block structures for performance optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To facilitate performance improvements in smart contract execution on Ethereum, such as pre-access warming of objects and enabling concurrent execution.

Method: The authors traced over 2 million Ethereum blocks using call and prestate tracers, analyzing transaction distributions, call tree structures, and conflict graph properties.

Result: Conflict graphs are primarily star-like in configuration and exhibit distinct structural properties. Observations were made regarding transaction distributions and smart contract invocation patterns.

Conclusion: Understanding the structure of conflict graphs and transaction behaviors can enhance parallelization potential and overall performance optimization in Ethereum smart contracts.

Abstract: Ethereum, a leading blockchain platform, has revolutionized the digital
economy by enabling decentralized transactions and the execution of smart
contracts. Ethereum transactions form the backbone of its network, facilitating
peer-to-peer exchanges and interactions with complex decentralized
applications. Smart contracts extend Ethereum's capabilities by automating
processes and enabling trustless execution of agreements. Hence, understanding
how these smart contracts interact is important in order to facilitate various
performance optimizations, such as warming objects before they are being
accessed and enabling concurrent execution. Of particular interest to us are
the development of the calling graph, as well as the read sets and write sets
of invocations within the same block, and the properties of the associated
conflict graph that is derived from them. The latter is important for
understanding the parallelization potential of smart contracts on Ethereum. We
traced upwards of 2 million recent Ethereum blocks using call tracer and
prestate tracer, out of a total of 21.4 million blocks at the time of writing.
We report on the transactions per block distribution, the structure of call
trees in smart contract invocations, the ratio of value-transfer transactions
to smart contract invocations, as well as provide a comprehensive study of the
structure of blocks' conflict graphs. We find that conflict graphs
predominantly show a star like configuration, as well as other noteworthy
structural properties.

*Jérémie Chalopin,Shantanu Das,Maria Kokkou*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper addresses self-stabilising leader election for particles in a triangular grid, proposing an algorithm exploiting particle movement under an unfair scheduler.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coordination in programmable matter systems is crucial for solving complex tasks, particularly under self-stabilising settings where particles operate on a geometric Amoebot model.

Method: A self-stabilising algorithm is introduced that uses particle movement and shared directional sense, overcoming classical impossibility results in constant-memory systems.

Result: The algorithm guarantees the election of a unique leader in connected configurations despite an unfair scheduler.

Conclusion: Movement combined with a shared grid framework enables self-stabilising leader election in programmable matter systems, advancing beyond established limitations.

Abstract: Leader election is a fundamental problem in distributed computing,
particularly within programmable matter systems, where coordination among
simple computational entities is crucial for solving complex tasks. In these
systems, particles (i.e., constant memory computational entities) operate in a
regular triangular grid as described in the geometric Amoebot model. While
leader election has been extensively studied in non self-stabilising settings,
self-stabilising solutions remain more limited. In this work, we study the
problem of self-stabilising leader election in connected (but not necessarily
simply connected) configurations. We present the first self-stabilising
algorithm for programmable matter that guarantees the election of a unique
leader under an unfair scheduler, assuming particles share a common sense of
direction. Our approach leverages particle movement, a capability not
previously exploited in the self-stabilising context. We show that movement in
conjunction with particles operating in a grid can overcome classical
impossibility results for constant-memory systems established by Dolev et al.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents RIMMS, a runtime-managed memory management system that simplifies application development for heterogeneous systems and delivers considerable speedups while minimizing overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Managing memory in heterogeneous systems with diverse compute architectures is complicated due to dynamic task mappings, requiring flexible and efficient solutions beyond static approaches.

Method: The paper proposes RIMMS, a lightweight, hardware-agnostic runtime memory management system. It tracks data, maintains consistency, and allocates memory efficiently without demanding platform-specific code modifications.

Result: Evaluation of RIMMS on radar signal processing applications in CPU+GPU and CPU+FPGA platforms showed up to 2.43X speedup on GPU-based systems and 1.82X on FPGA-based systems. RIMMS outperformed IRIS by up to 3.08X and matched native CUDA performance.

Conclusion: RIMMS simplifies heterogeneous system programming while delivering high performance, low overhead, and enhanced programmer productivity, making it ideal for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Efficient memory management in heterogeneous systems is increasingly
challenging due to diverse compute architectures (e.g., CPU, GPU, FPGA) and
dynamic task mappings not known at compile time. Existing approaches often
require programmers to manage data placement and transfers explicitly, or
assume static mappings that limit portability and scalability. This paper
introduces RIMMS (Runtime Integrated Memory Management System), a lightweight,
runtime-managed, hardware-agnostic memory abstraction layer that decouples
application development from low-level memory operations. RIMMS transparently
tracks data locations, manages consistency, and supports efficient memory
allocation across heterogeneous compute elements without requiring
platform-specific tuning or code modifications. We integrate RIMMS into a
baseline runtime and evaluate with complete radar signal processing
applications across CPU+GPU and CPU+FPGA platforms. RIMMS delivers up to 2.43X
speedup on GPU-based and 1.82X on FPGA-based systems over the baseline.
Compared to IRIS, a recent heterogeneous runtime system, RIMMS achieves up to
3.08X speedup and matches the performance of native CUDA implementations while
significantly reducing programming complexity. Despite operating at a higher
abstraction level, RIMMS incurs only 1-2 cycles of overhead per memory
management call, making it a low-cost solution. These results demonstrate
RIMMS's ability to deliver high performance and enhanced programmer
productivity in dynamic, real-world heterogeneous environments.

*Dan Wu,Zhaoying Li,Tulika Mitra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes "InkStream," a method for efficient and real-time inference on dynamic streaming graphs using event-based incremental updates, achieving significant acceleration while guaranteeing output identical to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNN methods struggle to handle dynamic, streaming graphs efficiently due to constant graph changes requiring frequent updates.

Method: InkStream introduces an event-based system to enable minimal computation and memory usage, updating only impacted nodes and data within the $k$-hop neighborhood and propagating effects incrementally.

Result: The proposed method achieved a performance acceleration of 2.5-427× on CPU clusters and 2.4-343× on GPU clusters during testing on various GNNs and large graphs, with guaranteed identical output to conventional methods.

Conclusion: InkStream is a highly extensible and efficient approach for GNN inference on streaming graphs, offering real-time processing and adaptability to different GNN models with minimal code changes.

Abstract: Classic Graph Neural Network (GNN) inference approaches, designed for static
graphs, are ill-suited for streaming graphs that evolve with time. The dynamism
intrinsic to streaming graphs necessitates constant updates, posing unique
challenges to acceleration on GPU. We address these challenges based on two key
insights: (1) Inside the $k$-hop neighborhood, a significant fraction of the
nodes is not impacted by the modified edges when the model uses min or max as
aggregation function; (2) When the model weights remain static while the graph
structure changes, node embeddings can incrementally evolve over time by
computing only the impacted part of the neighborhood. With these insights, we
propose a novel method, InkStream, designed for real-time inference with
minimal memory access and computation, while ensuring an identical output to
conventional methods. InkStream operates on the principle of propagating and
fetching data only when necessary. It uses an event-based system to control
inter-layer effect propagation and intra-layer incremental updates of node
embedding. InkStream is highly extensible and easily configurable by allowing
users to create and process customized events. We showcase that less than 10
lines of additional user code are needed to support popular GNN models such as
GCN, GraphSAGE, and GIN. Our experiments with three GNN models on four large
graphs demonstrate that InkStream accelerates by 2.5-427$\times$ on a CPU
cluster and 2.4-343$\times$ on two different GPU clusters while producing
identical outputs as GNN model inference on the latest graph snapshot.

*Haoxuan Ma,Xishun Liao,Yifan Liu,Chris Stanford,Jiaqi Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a transformer-based model to address biases in urban mobility modeling for shift workers, underrepresented in transportation datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shift workers, constituting a significant portion of the workforce, are underrepresented in traditional transportation surveys and planning.

Method: A transformer-based approach using GPS trajectory data, period-aware temporal embeddings, and a transition-focused loss function is employed to generate behaviorally valid activity patterns for non-standard hour workers.

Result: The generated data aligned well with GPS metrics from Los Angeles County (Average JSD < 0.02), indicating high validity and representational accuracy.

Conclusion: This approach bridges critical gaps in understanding urban mobility for shift workers, enabling more inclusive and precise transportation planning.

Abstract: This paper addresses a critical gap in urban mobility modeling by focusing on
shift workers, a population segment comprising 15-20% of the workforce in
industrialized societies yet systematically underrepresented in traditional
transportation surveys and planning. This underrepresentation is revealed in
this study by a comparative analysis of GPS and survey data, highlighting stark
differences between the bimodal temporal patterns of shift workers and the
conventional 9-to-5 schedules recorded in surveys. To address this bias, we
introduce a novel transformer-based approach that leverages fragmented GPS
trajectory data to generate complete, behaviorally valid activity patterns for
individuals working non-standard hours. Our method employs periodaware temporal
embeddings and a transition-focused loss function specifically designed to
capture the unique activity rhythms of shift workers and mitigate the inherent
biases in conventional transportation datasets. Evaluation shows that the
generated data achieves remarkable distributional alignment with GPS data from
Los Angeles County (Average JSD < 0.02 for all evaluation metrics). By
transforming incomplete GPS traces into complete, representative activity
patterns, our approach provides transportation planners with a powerful data
augmentation tool to fill critical gaps in understanding the 24/7 mobility
needs of urban populations, enabling precise and inclusive transportation
planning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dual-path Spatiotemporal Network for traffic forecasting in 5G networks, achieving better accuracy and generalization than ConvLSTM approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve spatiotemporal traffic forecasting in 5G networks, addressing the mobility of users and limitations of conventional AI models.

Method: A lightweight Spatiotemporal Network combining Scalar LSTM for temporal modeling, a 3-layer Conv3D module for spatial extraction, and a fusion layer to integrate both paths.

Result: The proposed model achieved a 23% reduction in MAE and a 30% improvement in generalization compared to ConvLSTM baselines using real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The dual-path Spatiotemporal Network is effective for spatiotemporal forecasting in 5G, enabling robust and scalable performance improvements over existing models.

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is vital for intelligent resource
management in 5G and beyond. However, conventional AI approaches often fail to
capture the intricate spatial and temporal patterns that exist, due to e.g.,
the mobility of users. We introduce a lightweight, dual-path Spatiotemporal
Network that leverages a Scalar LSTM (sLSTM) for efficient temporal modeling
and a three-layer Conv3D module for spatial feature extraction. A fusion layer
integrates both streams into a cohesive representation, enabling robust
forecasting. Our design improves gradient stability and convergence speed while
reducing prediction error. Evaluations on real-world datasets show superior
forecast performance over ConvLSTM baselines and strong generalization to
unseen regions, making it well-suited for large-scale, next-generation network
deployments. Experimental evaluation shows a 23% MAE reduction over ConvLSTM,
with a 30% improvement in model generalization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model operating entirely in the wavelet domain, avoiding traditional neural layers while achieving efficiency and competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an efficient and interpretable learning model by leveraging wavelet domain processing instead of overparameterized architectures like Transformers.

Method: The model applies learnable nonlinear transformations directly to wavelet coefficients, utilizing differentiable wavelet basis selection for adaptive processing.

Result: Achieved 89.3% accuracy on SST-2 sentiment classification with 72% fewer parameters and 58% less peak memory compared to a 4-layer Transformer.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential of spectral learning to provide compact and efficient alternatives to traditional neural architectures in vision and language tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a fully spectral learning framework that eliminates traditional
neural layers by operating entirely in the wavelet domain. The model applies
learnable nonlinear transformations, including soft-thresholding and gain-phase
modulation, directly to wavelet coefficients. It also includes a differentiable
wavelet basis selection mechanism, enabling adaptive processing using families
such as Haar, Daubechies, and Biorthogonal wavelets.
  Implemented in PyTorch with full 3D support, the model maintains a spectral
pipeline without spatial convolutions or attention. On synthetic 3D denoising
and natural language tasks from the GLUE benchmark, including SST-2 sentiment
classification, the model achieves 89.3 percent accuracy, close to a 4-layer
Transformer baseline (90.1 percent), while using 72 percent fewer parameters
and 58 percent less peak memory. Faster early convergence is observed due to
spectral sparsity priors.
  In contrast to the quadratic complexity of self-attention and large matrix
multiplications in Transformers, our approach uses linear-time wavelet
transforms and pointwise nonlinearities, significantly reducing inference cost.
This yields a compact, interpretable, and efficient alternative to neural
models. Our results support the viability of principled spectral learning in
both vision and language tasks, offering new directions for model design
without overparameterized architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural Architecture Search for Hardware Constrained Early Exit Neural Networks (NACHOS) automatically designs Early Exit Neural Networks (EENNs), optimizing their performance under computational constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The manual design of Early Exit Neural Networks (EENNs) is complex and challenging, requiring expertise to address various aspects like classifier placement, confidence thresholds, and efficiency. Automating this process can reduce complexity and improve results.

Method: NACHOS employs Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to automate the design of EENNs, enabling joint optimization of the backbone network and early exit classifiers under constraints related to accuracy and computational costs.

Result: The models generated by NACHOS provide a set of Pareto Optimal solutions balancing accuracy and computational efficiency, and these models are comparable to the state-of-the-art EENNs.

Conclusion: NACHOS demonstrates that automated NAS processes can effectively design hardware-constrained EENNs, offering high-quality solutions while addressing constraints. Additional regularization terms further enhance auxiliary classifier optimization.

Abstract: Early Exit Neural Networks (EENNs) endow astandard Deep Neural Network (DNN)
with Early Exit Classifiers (EECs), to provide predictions at intermediate
points of the processing when enough confidence in classification is achieved.
This leads to many benefits in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.
Currently, the design of EENNs is carried out manually by experts, a complex
and time-consuming task that requires accounting for many aspects, including
the correct placement, the thresholding, and the computational overhead of the
EECs. For this reason, the research is exploring the use of Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) to automatize the design of EENNs. Currently, few comprehensive
NAS solutions for EENNs have been proposed in the literature, and a fully
automated, joint design strategy taking into consideration both the backbone
and the EECs remains an open problem. To this end, this work presents Neural
Architecture Search for Hardware Constrained Early Exit Neural Networks

*Edmund F. Agyemang,Hansapani Rodrigo,Vincent Agbenyeavu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates deep learning models for predicting Influenza A outbreaks and finds that they outperform traditional models like ARIMA and ETS, with the Transformer showing the best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve predictive modeling for Influenza A outbreaks using advanced deep learning methods, given the public health significance of preventing respiratory deaths.

Method: The study uses historical data (2009-2023) to compare traditional models (ARIMA, ETS) against six deep learning architectures: Simple RNN, LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU, and Transformer. Performance is evaluated using metrics like MSE and MAE.

Result: Deep learning models significantly outperform traditional approaches, with the Transformer achieving the best predictive accuracy (MSE: 0.0433 ± 0.0020, MAE: 0.1126 ± 0.0016).

Conclusion: Deep learning, especially the Transformer architecture, offers a superior approach to forecasting Influenza A outbreaks. Its adoption could improve public health monitoring and intervention systems.

Abstract: Influenza A is responsible for 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory deaths a year,
though this estimate is an improvement from years past due to improvements in
sanitation, healthcare practices, and vaccination programs. In this study, we
perform a comparative analysis of traditional and deep learning models to
predict Influenza A outbreaks. Using historical data from January 2009 to
December 2023, we compared the performance of traditional ARIMA and Exponential
Smoothing(ETS) models with six distinct deep learning architectures: Simple
RNN, LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU, and Transformer. The results reveal a clear
superiority of all the deep learning models, especially the state-of-the-art
Transformer with respective average testing MSE and MAE of 0.0433 \pm 0.0020
and 0.1126 \pm 0.0016 for capturing the temporal complexities associated with
Influenza A data, outperforming well known traditional baseline ARIMA and ETS
models. These findings of this study provide evidence that state-of-the-art
deep learning architectures can enhance predictive modeling for infectious
diseases and indicate a more general trend toward using deep learning methods
to enhance public health forecasting and intervention planning strategies.
Future work should focus on how these models can be incorporated into real-time
forecasting and preparedness systems at an epidemic level, and integrated into
existing surveillance systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes four novel loss functions for stock trading strategies, evaluated with time-series models like transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods and a buy-and-hold baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty of making profitable stock trading decisions due to the volatile nature of the stock market.

Method: Developed four novel loss functions for stock trading and trained time-series models (e.g., transformers) to implicitly learn effective trading strategies based on these losses.

Result: The proposed losses integrated into models achieved notable returns (up to ~51% during 2021-2023), surpassing popular RL methods PPO and DDPG which achieved significantly lower profits for the same periods.

Conclusion: The proposed loss functions effectively guide models to develop robust trading strategies, demonstrating consistent and superior performance against benchmarks in highly volatile stock market scenarios.

Abstract: Stock trading has always been a challenging task due to the highly volatile
nature of the stock market. Making sound trading decisions to generate profit
is particularly difficult under such conditions. To address this, we propose
four novel loss functions to drive decision-making for a portfolio of stocks.
These functions account for the potential profits or losses based with respect
to buying or shorting respective stocks, enabling potentially any artificial
neural network to directly learn an effective trading strategy. Despite the
high volatility in stock market fluctuations over time, training time-series
models such as transformers on these loss functions resulted in trading
strategies that generated significant profits on a portfolio of 50 different
S&P 500 company stocks as compared to a benchmark reinforcment learning
techniques and a baseline buy and hold method. As an example, using 2021, 2022
and 2023 as three test periods, the Crossformer model adapted with our best
loss function was most consistent, resulting in returns of 51.42%, 51.04% and
48.62% respectively. In comparison, the best performing state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning methods, PPO and DDPG, only delivered maximum profits of
around 41%, 2.81% and 41.58% for the same periods. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces BikeVAE-GNN, a dual-task framework combining Variational Autoencoder and Hybrid Graph Neural Network to estimate cycling volumes in sparse urban bicycling networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the challenge of estimating cycling volumes in urban areas where bicycle count data is extremely sparse, which is crucial for sustainable urban and transport planning.

Method: BikeVAE-GNN utilizes a Hybrid Graph Neural Network incorporating GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE to capture spatial relationships and a Variational Autoencoder to synthetically augment the graph with nodes and edges.

Result: The proposed model achieved a mean absolute error of 30.82 bicycles per day, with an accuracy of 99% and F1-score of 0.99, evaluated on highly sparse bicycling counts from Melbourne.

Conclusion: BikeVAE-GNN significantly enhances the ability to estimate and categorize bicycling traffic levels in sparse data environments, providing useful insights for the development of sustainable cycling infrastructure.

Abstract: Accurate link-level bicycle volume estimation is essential for informed urban
and transport planning but it is challenged by extremely sparse count data in
urban bicycling networks worldwide. We propose BikeVAE-GNN, a novel dual-task
framework augmenting a Hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) with Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) to estimate Average Daily Bicycle (ADB) counts, addressing
sparse bicycle networks. The Hybrid-GNN combines Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and GraphSAGE to effectively model
intricate spatial relationships in sparse networks while VAE generates
synthetic nodes and edges to enrich the graph structure and enhance the
estimation performance. BikeVAE-GNN simultaneously performs - regression for
bicycling volume estimation and classification for bicycling traffic level
categorization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BikeVAE-GNN using
OpenStreetMap data and publicly available bicycle count data within the City of
Melbourne - where only 141 of 15,933 road segments have labeled counts
(resulting in 99% count data sparsity). Our experiments show that BikeVAE-GNN
outperforms machine learning and baseline GNN models, achieving a mean absolute
error (MAE) of 30.82 bicycles per day, accuracy of 99% and F1-score of 0.99.
Ablation studies further validate the effective role of Hybrid-GNN and VAE
components. Our research advances bicycling volume estimation in sparse
networks using novel and state-of-the-art approaches, providing insights for
sustainable bicycling infrastructures.

*Sangwoo Seo,Jimin Seo,Yoonho Lee,Donghyeon Kim,Hyejin Shin,Banghyun Sung,Chanyoung Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Graph Neural Network-based method for efficient subgraph matching in large-scale circuit verification, addressing limitations of traditional methods and existing deep learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subgraph matching is crucial in electronic design automation and circuit verification, but current techniques struggle with generalization, computational inefficiency, and global subgraph embedding.

Method: The proposed method uses Graph Neural Networks to predict high-probability regions for the target circuit, constructs negative samples for learning, and extracts global subgraph embeddings directly from circuits to improve scalability and efficiency.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in time efficiency and accuracy for target region prediction compared to existing methods, demonstrating scalability for large circuits.

Conclusion: The approach offers an effective, scalable solution for subgraph matching, leveraging GNNs to overcome existing challenges in circuit verification and electronic design automation.

Abstract: Subgraph matching plays an important role in electronic design automation
(EDA) and circuit verification. Traditional rule-based methods have limitations
in generalizing to arbitrary target circuits. Furthermore, node-to-node
matching approaches tend to be computationally inefficient, particularly for
large-scale circuits. Deep learning methods have emerged as a potential
solution to address these challenges, but existing models fail to efficiently
capture global subgraph embeddings or rely on inefficient matching matrices,
which limits their effectiveness for large circuits. In this paper, we propose
an efficient graph matching approach that utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
to predict regions of high probability for containing the target circuit.
Specifically, we construct various negative samples to enable GNNs to
accurately learn the presence of target circuits and develop an approach to
directly extracting subgraph embeddings from the entire circuit, which captures
global subgraph information and addresses the inefficiency of applying GNNs to
all candidate subgraphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of time efficiency and
target region prediction, offering a scalable and effective solution for
subgraph matching in large-scale circuits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study compares machine learning and deep learning methods for predicting cognitive abilities using neuroimaging data, focusing on task-based fMRI and multimodal approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To gain insights into neural mechanisms underlying cognition and explore its application in precision medicine and early neurological detection.

Method: Benchmarking classical (KRR) and advanced DL (GNN, TGNN) models using RS and task-based fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project dataset.

Result: Task-based fMRI outperformed RS fMRI in cognitive prediction. GNN combining SC and FC achieved the highest performance overall, but TGNN struggled with RS data.

Conclusion: Appropriate model architectures and feature representations are crucial for leveraging neuroimaging data's spatial and temporal richness. Multimodal graph-aware DL models show promise in advancing brain-behavior modeling.

Abstract: Predicting cognition from neuroimaging data in healthy individuals offers
insights into the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive abilities, with
potential applications in precision medicine and early detection of
neurological and psychiatric conditions. This study systematically benchmarked
classical machine learning (Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)) and advanced deep
learning (DL) models (Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer-GNN (TGNN))
for cognitive prediction using Resting-state (RS), Working Memory, and Language
task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset.
  Our results, based on R2 scores, Pearson correlation coefficient, and mean
absolute error, revealed that task-based fMRI, eliciting neural responses
directly tied to cognition, outperformed RS fMRI in predicting cognitive
behavior. Among the methods compared, a GNN combining structural connectivity
(SC) and functional connectivity (FC) consistently achieved the highest
performance across all fMRI modalities; however, its advantage over KRR using
FC alone was not statistically significant. The TGNN, designed to model
temporal dynamics with SC as a prior, performed competitively with FC-based
approaches for task-fMRI but struggled with RS data, where its performance
aligned with the lower-performing GNN that directly used fMRI time-series data
as node features. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting
appropriate model architectures and feature representations to fully leverage
the spatial and temporal richness of neuroimaging data.
  This study highlights the potential of multimodal graph-aware DL models to
combine SC and FC for cognitive prediction, as well as the promise of
Transformer-based approaches for capturing temporal dynamics. By providing a
comprehensive comparison of models, this work serves as a guide for advancing
brain-behavior modeling using fMRI, SC and DL.

*J. Poole,P. Gardner,A. J. Hughes,N. Dervilis,R. S. Mills,T. A. Dardeno,K. Worden*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenge of using structural health monitoring (SHM) data across different structures by applying transfer learning and leveraging physics-based methods to ensure feature consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Obtaining labeled data for SHM systems is expensive and impractical, especially when attempting to generalize across multiple structures.

Method: The Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) is utilized to quantify the similarity between modes of healthy structures, aiming to identify features that maintain consistent behavior across domains.

Result: The MAC aligns well with supervised metrics for measuring joint-distribution similarity, proving effective in selecting invariant features for transfer learning.

Conclusion: MAC provides a physics-driven framework to improve feature selection for unsupervised transfer learning in SHM systems, as validated by both numerical and experimental case studies.

Abstract: Data used for training structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are
expensive and often impractical to obtain, particularly labelled data.
Population-based SHM presents a potential solution to this issue by considering
the available data across a population of structures. However, differences
between structures will mean the training and testing distributions will
differ; thus, conventional machine learning methods cannot be expected to
generalise between structures. To address this issue, transfer learning (TL),
can be used to leverage information across related domains. An important
consideration is that the lack of labels in the target domain limits data-based
metrics to quantifying the discrepancy between the marginal distributions.
Thus, a prerequisite for the application of typical unsupervised TL methods is
to identify suitable source structures (domains), and a set of features, for
which the conditional distributions are related to the target structure.
Generally, the selection of domains and features is reliant on domain
expertise; however, for complex mechanisms, such as the influence of damage on
the dynamic response of a structure, this task is not trivial. In this paper,
knowledge of physics is leveraged to select more similar features, the modal
assurance criterion (MAC) is used to quantify the correspondence between the
modes of healthy structures. The MAC is shown to have high correspondence with
a supervised metric that measures joint-distribution similarity, which is the
primary indicator of whether a classifier will generalise between domains. The
MAC is proposed as a measure for selecting a set of features that behave
consistently across domains when subjected to damage, i.e. features with
invariance in the conditional distributions. This approach is demonstrated on
numerical and experimental case studies to verify its effectiveness in various
applications.

*Ethan Lo,Dan C. Lo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using accessible machine learning models like logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest for exoplanet discovery, showing promising results after employing data augmentation to tackle dataset biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to simplify the discovery process of exoplanets by leveraging machine learning models that do not rely on complex algorithms or supercomputers.

Method: The study uses three machine learning models — logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest — on data from NASA's Kepler telescope, applying data augmentation techniques to address imbalances and biases in the dataset.

Result: The models show promising scores, but accuracy varies depending on the model. Data augmentation significantly improves recall and precision in exoplanet discovery.

Conclusion: Data augmentation effectively enhances ML models' fairness and generalization in exoplanet detection, demonstrating a simpler yet efficient alternative to existing advanced systems.

Abstract: With manual searching processes, the rate at which scientists and astronomers
discover exoplanets is slow because of inefficiencies that require an extensive
time of laborious inspections. In fact, as of now there have been about only
5,000 confirmed exoplanets since the late 1900s. Recently, machine learning
(ML) has proven to be extremely valuable and efficient in various fields,
capable of processing massive amounts of data in addition to increasing its
accuracy by learning. Though ML models for discovering exoplanets owned by
large corporations (e.g. NASA) exist already, they largely depend on complex
algorithms and supercomputers. In an effort to reduce such complexities, in
this paper, we report the results and potential benefits of various, well-known
ML models in the discovery and validation of extrasolar planets. The ML models
that are examined in this study include logistic regression, k-nearest
neighbors, and random forest. The dataset on which the models train and predict
is acquired from NASA's Kepler space telescope. The initial results show
promising scores for each model. However, potential biases and dataset
imbalances necessitate the use of data augmentation techniques to further
ensure fairer predictions and improved generalization. This study concludes
that, in the context of searching for exoplanets, data augmentation techniques
significantly improve the recall and precision, while the accuracy varies for
each model.

TL;DR: Javed, Sharifnassab, and Sutton (2024) developed SwiftTD to enhance TD learning by integrating step-size optimization and decay, outperforming standard algorithms on prediction tasks. They extended this to control problems via Swift-Sarsa, proving robust against noisy inputs and capable of processing many features efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving TD learning and reinforcement learning algorithms to address challenges like noisy features, effective learning rates, and hyper-parameter robustness.

Method: Introduced SwiftTD and extended it to control problems as Swift-Sarsa, leveraging True Online Sarsa($\lambda$) principles. Proposed the operant conditioning benchmark to test the algorithm's ability to differentiate between relevant and noisy signals.

Result: Swift-Sarsa successfully assigned credit to relevant signals without prior knowledge, demonstrating scalability and robustness in handling noisy, high-dimensional input spaces.

Conclusion: SwiftTD and Swift-Sarsa highlight advancements in efficient reinforcement learning, enabling algorithms to learn effectively from noisy inputs and large feature sets, showcasing potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Javed, Sharifnassab, and Sutton (2024) introduced a new algorithm for TD
learning -- SwiftTD -- that augments True Online TD($\lambda$) with step-size
optimization, a bound on the effective learning rate, and step-size decay. In
their experiments SwiftTD outperformed True Online TD($\lambda$) and
TD($\lambda$) on a variety of prediction tasks derived from Atari games, and
its performance was robust to the choice of hyper-parameters. In this extended
abstract we extend SwiftTD to work for control problems. We combine the key
ideas behind SwiftTD with True Online Sarsa($\lambda$) to develop an on-policy
reinforcement learning algorithm called $\textit{Swift-Sarsa}$.
  We propose a simple benchmark for linear on-policy control called the
$\textit{operant conditioning benchmark}$. The key challenge in the operant
conditioning benchmark is that a very small subset of input signals are
relevant for decision making. The majority of the signals are noise sampled
from a non-stationary distribution. To learn effectively, the agent must learn
to differentiate between the relevant signals and the noisy signals, and
minimize prediction errors by assigning credit to the weight parameters
associated with the relevant signals.
  Swift-Sarsa, when applied to the operant conditioning benchmark, learned to
assign credit to the relevant signals without any prior knowledge of the
structure of the problem. It opens the door for solution methods that learn
representations by searching over hundreds of millions of features in parallel
without performance degradation due to noisy or bad features.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are presented for solving complex differential equations, addressing both forward and inverse problems by minimizing residuals derived from prior analytical knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of solving complex differential equations and optimizing parameters using neural networks by incorporating prior analytical information to improve performance and overcome data sparsity.

Method: The paper develops PINNs with varying residual complexities, starting from simpler models and progressing to advanced models like the heat equation, utilizing Python and PyTorch as computational tools.

Result: PINNs effectively integrate prior knowledge through residual minimization, simultaneously solving forward and inverse problems and demonstrating capabilities for extrapolating trends from sparse data.

Conclusion: The study confirms the utility of PINNs as efficient tools for solving differential equations by leveraging prior information, optimizing solutions and parameters, and reducing overfitting in sparse data scenarios.

Abstract: Mathematical models in neural networks are powerful tools for solving complex
differential equations and optimizing their parameters; that is, solving the
forward and inverse problems, respectively. A forward problem predicts the
output of a network for a given input by optimizing weights and biases. An
inverse problem finds equation parameters or coefficients that effectively
model the data. A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) can solve both
problems. PINNs inject prior analytical information about the data into the
cost function to improve model performance outside the training set boundaries.
This also allows PINNs to efficiently solve problems with sparse data without
overfitting by extrapolating the model to fit larger trends in the data. The
prior information we implement is in the form of differential equations.
Residuals are the differences between the left-hand and right-hand sides of
corresponding differential equations; PINNs minimize these residuals to
effectively solve the differential equation and take advantage of prior
knowledge. In this way, the solution and parameters are embedded into the loss
function and optimized, allowing both the weights of the neural network and the
model parameters to be found simultaneously, solving both the forward and
inverse problems in the process. In this paper, we will create PINNs with
residuals of varying complexity, beginning with linear and quadratic models and
then expanding to fit models for the heat equation and other complex
differential equations. We will mainly use Python as the computing language,
using the PyTorch library to aid us in our research.

Conclusion: ATGC-Gen proves the potential of adapting language models for genomic design, achieving advancements in controllable and functional sequence generation.

Abstract: We consider controllable DNA sequence design, where sequences are generated
by conditioning on specific biological properties. While language models (LMs)
such as GPT and BERT have achieved remarkable success in natural language
generation, their application to DNA sequence generation remains largely
underexplored. In this work, we introduce ATGC-Gen, an Automated Transformer
Generator for Controllable Generation, which leverages cross-modal encoding to
integrate diverse biological signals. ATGC-Gen is instantiated with both
decoder-only and encoder-only transformer architectures, allowing flexible
training and generation under either autoregressive or masked recovery
objectives. We evaluate ATGC-Gen on representative tasks including promoter and
enhancer sequence design, and further introduce a new dataset based on ChIP-Seq
experiments for modeling protein binding specificity. Our experiments
demonstrate that ATGC-Gen can generate fluent, diverse, and biologically
relevant sequences aligned with the desired properties. Compared to prior
methods, our model achieves notable improvements in controllability and
functional relevance, highlighting the potential of language models in
advancing programmable genomic design. The source code is released at

Result: Existing theories assess feature learning strength, not quality, indicating a gap in understanding neural network generalization.

Conclusion: Theories of feature learning need to incorporate feature quality to better explain and predict neural network generalization performance.

Abstract: Neural networks outperform kernel methods, sometimes by orders of magnitude,
e.g. on staircase functions. This advantage stems from the ability of neural
networks to learn features, adapting their hidden representations to better
capture the data. We introduce a concept we call feature quality to measure
this performance improvement. We examine existing theories of feature learning
and demonstrate empirically that they primarily assess the strength of feature
learning, rather than the quality of the learned features themselves.
Consequently, current theories of feature learning do not provide a sufficient
foundation for developing theories of neural network generalization.

*Jianyuan Bo,Hao Wu,Yuan Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STAG is a self-supervised framework for converting graph structures into discrete tokens, enabling zero-shot transfer learning with large language models (LLMs) and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for leveraging LLMs in graph learning face difficulties in embedding graph structures effectively, often requiring labeled data and expensive alignment mechanisms.

Method: STAG employs a novel quantization approach using a frozen codebook with soft assignment and KL divergence to encode graph structures into tokenized formats compatible with LLMs.

Result: STAG achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple node classification tasks, demonstrating compatibility with various LLM architectures while enabling zero-shot transfer learning.

Conclusion: The paper presents an elegant and efficient solution for bridging graph learning with large language models, overcoming traditional limitations and expanding adaptability.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation for
modeling complex relationships across diverse domains. With the rise of large
language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in leveraging their
capabilities for graph learning. However, current approaches face significant
challenges in embedding structural information into LLM-compatible formats,
requiring either computationally expensive alignment mechanisms or manual graph
verbalization techniques that often lose critical structural details. Moreover,
these methods typically require labeled data from source domains for effective
transfer learning, significantly constraining their adaptability. We propose
STAG, a novel self-supervised framework that directly quantizes graph
structural information into discrete tokens using a frozen codebook. Unlike
traditional quantization approaches, our method employs soft assignment and KL
divergence guided quantization to address the unique challenges of graph data,
which lacks natural tokenization structures. Our framework enables both
LLM-based and traditional learning approaches, supporting true zero-shot
transfer learning without requiring labeled data even in the source domain.
Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple
node classification benchmarks while maintaining compatibility with different
LLM architectures, offering an elegant solution to bridging graph learning with
LLMs.

*Zain Asgar,Michelle Nguyen,Sachin Katti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a system for efficiently orchestrating dynamic AI agent workloads on heterogeneous compute infrastructures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI agents, which require dynamic and structurally complex workloads, necessitates scalable deployment and infrastructure solutions to handle multimodal and resource-intensive tasks.

Method: The system includes a framework for optimizing AI workload graphs, an MLIR-based system for generating and compiling granular operators for various hardware, and dynamic orchestration to meet SLA requirements.

Result: The system demonstrates significant Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) benefits, with surprising findings showing that heterogeneous setups, combining old and new GPUs, can achieve efficiency comparable to the latest homogenous GPU systems.

Conclusion: Efficient orchestration of AI agents on heterogeneous infrastructures is feasible and cost-effective, extending the usability of existing hardware.

Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a dominant workload in a wide range of
applications, promising to be the vehicle that delivers the promised benefits
of AI to enterprises and consumers. Unlike conventional software or static
inference, agentic workloads are dynamic and structurally complex. Often these
agents are directed graphs of compute and IO operations that span multi-modal
data input and conversion), data processing and context gathering (e.g vector
DB lookups), multiple LLM inferences, tool calls, etc. To scale AI agent usage,
we need efficient and scalable deployment and agent-serving infrastructure.
  To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we present a system design for
dynamic orchestration of AI agent workloads on heterogeneous compute
infrastructure spanning CPUs and accelerators, both from different vendors and
across different performance tiers within a single vendor. The system delivers
several building blocks: a framework for planning and optimizing agentic AI
execution graphs using cost models that account for compute, memory, and
bandwidth constraints of different HW; a MLIR based representation and
compilation system that can decompose AI agent execution graphs into granular
operators and generate code for different HW options; and a dynamic
orchestration system that can place the granular components across a
heterogeneous compute infrastructure and stitch them together while meeting an
end-to-end SLA. Our design performs a systems level TCO optimization and
preliminary results show that leveraging a heterogeneous infrastructure can
deliver significant TCO benefits. A preliminary surprising finding is that for
some workloads a heterogeneous combination of older generation GPUs with newer
accelerators can deliver similar TCO as the latest generation homogenous GPU
infrastructure design, potentially extending the life of deployed
infrastructure.

*Björn Kischelewski,Benjamin Guedj,David Wahl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents RestoreAI, an AI-based system to predict landmine risk using spatial pattern information, enhancing landmine clearance efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current landmine removal processes are slow and resource-intensive, and existing AI methods lack focus on utilizing spatial patterns for risk prediction.

Method: RestoreAI uses three approaches for landmine risk prediction: linear pattern deminer (based on PCA), curved pattern deminer (using principal curves), and Bayesian pattern deminer (incorporating expert knowledge).

Result: RestoreAI improves clearance efficiency, with a top-performing deminer increasing the cleared landmines by 14.37 percentage points per timestep and reducing clearance time by 24.45%.

Conclusion: RestoreAI achieves significant efficiency improvements in landmine clearance, with linear patterns offering a viable and efficient option for prediction.

Abstract: Landmine removal is a slow, resource-intensive process affecting over 60
countries. While AI has been proposed to enhance explosive ordnance (EO)
detection, existing methods primarily focus on object recognition, with limited
attention to prediction of landmine risk based on spatial pattern information.
This work aims to answer the following research question: How can AI be used to
predict landmine risk from landmine patterns to improve clearance time
efficiency? To that effect, we introduce RestoreAI, an AI system for
pattern-based risk estimation of remaining explosives. RestoreAI is the first
AI system that leverages landmine patterns for risk prediction, improving the
accuracy of estimating the residual risk of missing EO prior to land release.
We particularly focus on the implementation of three instances of RestoreAI,
respectively, linear, curved and Bayesian pattern deminers. First, the linear
pattern deminer uses linear landmine patterns from a principal component
analysis (PCA) for the landmine risk prediction. Second, the curved pattern
deminer uses curved landmine patterns from principal curves. Finally, the
Bayesian pattern deminer incorporates prior expert knowledge by using a
Bayesian pattern risk prediction. Evaluated on real-world landmine data,
RestoreAI significantly boosts clearance efficiency. The top-performing
pattern-based deminers achieved a 14.37 percentage point increase in the
average share of cleared landmines per timestep and required 24.45% less time
than the best baseline deminer to locate all landmines. Interestingly, linear
and curved pattern deminers showed no significant performance difference,
suggesting that more efficient linear patterns are a viable option for risk
prediction.

*Obumneme Nwafor,Mohammed Abdul Majeed Al Hooti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-driven system to predict maintenance risks for green hydrogen projects in Oman, leveraging meteorological data due to a lack of historical infrastructure data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oman aims to be a global leader in green hydrogen through national auctions and partnerships but faces a significant knowledge gap due to limited operational data from major hydrogen infrastructure projects in desert environments.

Method: The paper proposes using an Artificial Intelligence system that analyzes publicly available meteorological data to develop a Maintenance Pressure Index (MPI) for predicting maintenance risks and assessing infrastructure planning.

Result: The AI system offers metrics to predict future risks to hydrogen infrastructure and benchmarks these predictions against temporal data, aiding in better regulatory decision-making and auction evaluations.

Conclusion: The tool addresses critical data gaps in desert hydrogen projects, allowing for more informed infrastructure planning and operational risk evaluation, even in the absence of historical facility data.

Abstract: As green hydrogen emerges as a major component of global decarbonisation,
Oman has positioned itself strategically through national auctions and
international partnerships. Following two successful green hydrogen project
rounds, the country launched its third auction (R3) in the Duqm region. While
this area exhibits relative geospatial homogeneity, it is still vulnerable to
environmental fluctuations that pose inherent risks to productivity. Despite
growing global investment in green hydrogen, operational data remains scarce,
with major projects like Saudi Arabia's NEOM facility not expected to commence
production until 2026, and Oman's ACME Duqm project scheduled for 2028. This
absence of historical maintenance and performance data from large-scale
hydrogen facilities in desert environments creates a major knowledge gap for
accurate risk assessment for infrastructure planning and auction decisions.
Given this data void, environmental conditions emerge as accessible and
reliable proxy for predicting infrastructure maintenance pressures, because
harsh desert conditions such as dust storms, extreme temperatures, and humidity
fluctuations are well-documented drivers of equipment degradation in renewable
energy systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Artificial
Intelligence decision support system that leverages publicly available
meteorological data to develop a predictive Maintenance Pressure Index (MPI),
which predicts risk levels and future maintenance demands on hydrogen
infrastructure. This tool strengthens regulatory foresight and operational
decision-making by enabling temporal benchmarking to assess and validate
performance claims over time. It can be used to incorporate temporal risk
intelligence into auction evaluation criteria despite the absence of historical
operational benchmarks.

Result: $K^4$ achieves new state-of-the-art performance (AUROC: 0.995-0.999), outperforms baselines by large margins, and is significantly faster with training taking under 4 seconds and inference taking as low as 4 μs.

Conclusion: $K^4$ offers a high-performance, realistic, and efficient alternative to traditional LogAD methods, addressing previous shortcomings.

Abstract: Existing Log Anomaly Detection (LogAD) methods are often slow, dependent on
error-prone parsing, and use unrealistic evaluation protocols. We introduce
$K^4$, an unsupervised and parser-independent framework for high-performance
online detection. $K^4$ transforms arbitrary log embeddings into compact

TL;DR: The paper presents a machine learning framework with innovations in data leakage prevention, uncertainty quantification, and cross-institutional validation for blood pressure (BP) prediction in critical care settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ML approaches for BP monitoring in ICUs lack sufficient external validation, uncertainty quantification, and mechanisms to prevent data leakage.

Method: The study uses quantile regression for uncertainty quantification, systematic leakage prevention, and external validation of models trained on MIMIC-III and eICU databases. An ensemble of Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and XGBoost models was used.

Result: The model achieved clinically acceptable results in internal validation (e.g., R^2 = 0.86 for SBP), but external validation had a performance degradation of 30%, especially for hypotensive patients. Uncertainty intervals enabled risk-stratified monitoring.

Conclusion: The framework sets realistic deployment expectations for AI-assisted BP monitoring in ICU environments with considerations for uncertainty and cross-institutional validity, contributing to its clinical usability.

Abstract: Blood pressure (BP) monitoring is critical in in tensive care units (ICUs)
where hemodynamic instability can
  rapidly progress to cardiovascular collapse. Current machine
  learning (ML) approaches suffer from three limitations: lack of
  external validation, absence of uncertainty quantification, and
  inadequate data leakage prevention. This study presents the
  first comprehensive framework with novel algorithmic leakage
  prevention, uncertainty quantification, and cross-institutional
  validation for electronic health records (EHRs) based BP pre dictions. Our
methodology implemented systematic data leakage
  prevention, uncertainty quantification through quantile regres sion, and
external validation between the MIMIC-III and eICU
  databases. An ensemble framework combines Gradient Boosting,
  Random Forest, and XGBoost with 74 features across five
  physiological domains. Internal validation achieved a clinically
  acceptable performance (for SBP: R^2 = 0.86, RMSE = 6.03
  mmHg; DBP: R^2 = 0.49, RMSE = 7.13 mmHg), meeting AAMI
  standards. External validation showed 30% degradation with
  critical limitations in patients with hypotensive. Uncertainty
  quantification generated valid prediction intervals (80.3% SBP
  and 79.9% DBP coverage), enabling risk-stratified protocols
  with narrow intervals (< 15 mmHg) for standard monitoring
  and wide intervals (> 30 mmHg) for manual verification. This
  framework provides realistic deployment expectations for cross institutional
AI-assisted BP monitoring in critical care settings.

*Yue Hu,Zanxia Cao,Yingchao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dimer-Enhanced Optimization (DEO), a method that leverages the Dimer technique to improve training of deep neural networks by addressing challenges like saddle points and flat regions using efficient curvature estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: First-order optimization methods such as SGD and Adam struggle with navigating complex loss landscapes, while second-order methods are computationally infeasible for large-scale models.

Method: DEO adapts the Dimer method, originally from molecular dynamics, to neural network training. It uses gradient information to approximate the smallest eigenvector of the Hessian and periodically projects the gradient to avoid saddle points and flat regions.

Result: Experiments using a Transformer toy model show that DEO enhances training efficiency and performs competitively compared to standard first-order methods.

Conclusion: DEO successfully incorporates physics-inspired curvature estimation into first-order optimization, expanding the capability of neural network training to navigate challenging loss landscapes.

Abstract: First-order optimization methods, such as SGD and Adam, are widely used for
training large-scale deep neural networks due to their computational efficiency
and robust performance. However, relying solely on gradient information, these
methods often struggle to navigate complex loss landscapes with flat regions,
plateaus, and saddle points. Second-order methods, which use curvature
information from the Hessian matrix, can address these challenges but are
computationally infeasible for large models. The Dimer method, a first-order
technique that constructs two closely spaced points to probe the local geometry
of a potential energy surface, efficiently estimates curvature using only
gradient information. Inspired by its use in molecular dynamics simulations for
locating saddle points, we propose Dimer-Enhanced Optimization (DEO), a novel
framework to escape saddle points in neural network training. DEO adapts the
Dimer method to explore a broader region of the loss landscape, approximating
the Hessian's smallest eigenvector without computing the full matrix. By
periodically projecting the gradient onto the subspace orthogonal to the
minimum curvature direction, DEO guides the optimizer away from saddle points
and flat regions, enhancing training efficiency with non-stepwise updates.
Preliminary experiments on a Transformer toy model show DEO achieves
competitive performance compared to standard first-order methods, improving
navigation of complex loss landscapes. Our work repurposes physics-inspired,
first-order curvature estimation to enhance neural network training in
high-dimensional spaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are efficient but challenging to fine-tune, and methods like prompt-tuning are limited by fixed inputs. This paper introduces FedDPG, improving adaptability and privacy in federated learning with dynamic prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage PLMs efficiently for NLP tasks while addressing data privacy and computational challenges in federated learning.

Method: Introduce the Federated Dynamic Prompt Generator (FedDPG), which uses a dynamic prompt generator network for context-aware prompts in federated learning.

Result: FedDPG outperforms existing parameter-efficient methods in terms of global model performance, reduces computation time, and minimizes parameter communication.

Conclusion: FedDPG enhances performance and efficiency in federated learning setups, offering better adaptability and privacy-preserving solutions for NLP tasks.

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various NLP tasks. However, traditional fine-tuning methods for leveraging
PLMs for downstream tasks entail significant computational overhead.
Prompt-tuning has emerged as an efficient alternative that involves prepending
a limited number of parameters to the input sequence and only updating them
while the PLM's parameters are frozen. However, this technique's prompts remain
fixed for all inputs, reducing the model's flexibility. The Federated Learning
(FL) technique has gained attention in recent years to address the growing
concerns around data privacy. However, challenges such as communication and
computation limitations of clients still need to be addressed. To mitigate
these challenges, this paper introduces the Federated Dynamic Prompt Generator
(FedDPG), which incorporates a dynamic prompt generator network to generate
context-aware prompts based on the given input, ensuring flexibility and
adaptability while prioritising data privacy in federated learning settings.
Our experiments on three NLP benchmark datasets showcase that FedDPG
outperforms the state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in
terms of global model performance, and has significantly reduced the
calculation time and the number of parameters to be sent through the FL
network.

*Tolga Dimlioglu,Anna Choromanska*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Distributed Pull-Push Force (DPPF) algorithm to improve communication efficiency and model generalization in distributed training of deep neural networks (DNNs) by finding flatter regions of the loss landscape.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency and generalization performance of distributed deep learning training methods, addressing the trade-off between communication overhead and model accuracy.

Method: The authors propose introducing a sharpness measure called Inverse Mean Valley as a regularizer to direct workers toward flat minima during training. This measure is integrated into the distributed objective to balance consensus steps and promote better collaborative results, resulting in the DPPF algorithm.

Result: Empirical results show DPPF achieves better communication efficiency and generalization performance compared to existing methods, while theoretical analyses confirm its ability to locate flat minima and ensure convergence.

Conclusion: The DPPF algorithm effectively addresses the trade-offs in distributed DNN training, improves generalization, reduces communication overhead, and provides theoretical guarantees for convergence and generalization.

Abstract: We study centralized distributed data parallel training of deep neural
networks (DNNs), aiming to improve the trade-off between communication
efficiency and model performance of the local gradient methods. To this end, we
revisit the flat-minima hypothesis, which suggests that models with better
generalization tend to lie in flatter regions of the loss landscape. We
introduce a simple, yet effective, sharpness measure, Inverse Mean Valley, and
demonstrate its strong correlation with the generalization gap of DNNs. We
incorporate an efficient relaxation of this measure into the distributed
training objective as a lightweight regularizer that encourages workers to
collaboratively seek wide minima. The regularizer exerts a pushing force that
counteracts the consensus step pulling the workers together, giving rise to the
Distributed Pull-Push Force (DPPF) algorithm. Empirically, we show that DPPF
outperforms other communication-efficient approaches and achieves better
generalization performance than local gradient methods and synchronous gradient
averaging, while significantly reducing communication overhead. In addition,
our loss landscape visualizations confirm the ability of DPPF to locate flatter
minima. On the theoretical side, we show that DPPF guides workers to span flat
valleys, with the final valley width governed by the interplay between push and
pull strengths, and that its pull-push dynamics is self-stabilizing. We further
provide generalization guarantees linked to the valley width and prove
convergence in the non-convex setting.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method leveraging language models and graph neural networks to accelerate the discovery of metallic glasses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency and high cost of synthesizing metallic glasses necessitate new approaches for exploring vast material spaces.

Method: The authors use material network representations with node elements encoded by Wikipedia language models, employing graph neural networks for relational exploration.

Result: They demonstrate the potential of natural language embeddings to enhance material design through AI, offering better generalizability and predictability.

Conclusion: This research showcases a novel and efficient AI-driven framework, advancing the exploration of amorphous materials via natural language processing and graph neural networks.

Abstract: Synthesizing new materials efficiently is highly demanded in various research
fields. However, this process is usually slow and expensive, especially for
metallic glasses, whose formation strongly depends on the optimal combinations
of multiple elements to resist crystallization. This constraint renders only
several thousands of candidates explored in the vast material space since 1960.
Recently, data-driven approaches armed by advanced machine learning techniques
provided alternative routes for intelligent materials design. Due to data
scarcity and immature material encoding, the conventional tabular data is
usually mined by statistical learning algorithms, giving limited model
predictability and generalizability. Here, we propose sophisticated data
learning from material network representations. The node elements are encoded
from the Wikipedia by a language model. Graph neural networks with versatile
architectures are designed to serve as recommendation systems to explore hidden
relationships among materials. By employing Wikipedia embeddings from different
languages, we assess the capability of natural languages in materials design.
Our study proposes a new paradigm to harvesting new amorphous materials and
beyond with artificial intelligence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning framework using convolutional autoencoders enables unsupervised feature extraction from intracardiac electrograms, with the goal of automating atrial fibrillation driver detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atrial Fibrillation ablation therapies are often ineffective in persistent cases due to the involvement of non-pulmonary vein drivers, necessitating better analytical methods for identifying arrhythmogenic regions.

Method: The study employs convolutional autoencoders to process electrograms from a large dataset of 291 patients in an unsupervised manner, extracting latent representations of atrial electrical activity for downstream classification tasks.

Result: Latent representations preserved EGM morphology while achieving moderate classifier performance (AUC 0.73-0.76) for detecting rotational and focal activity, and high performance (AUC 0.93) for identifying EGM entanglement.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a real-time, automated tool for clinical integration in electroanatomical mapping systems, demonstrating the potential of unsupervised learning in intracardiac signal analysis.

Abstract: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained arrhythmia, yet
current ablation therapies, including pulmonary vein isolation, are frequently
ineffective in persistent AF due to the involvement of non-pulmonary vein
drivers. This study proposes a deep learning framework using convolutional
autoencoders for unsupervised feature extraction from unipolar and bipolar
intracavitary electrograms (EGMs) recorded during AF in ablation studies. These
latent representations of atrial electrical activity enable the
characterization and automation of EGM analysis, facilitating the detection of
AF drivers.
  The database consisted of 11,404 acquisitions recorded from 291 patients,
containing 228,080 unipolar EGMs and 171,060 bipolar EGMs. The autoencoders
successfully learned latent representations with low reconstruction loss,
preserving the morphological features. The extracted embeddings allowed
downstream classifiers to detect rotational and focal activity with moderate
performance (AUC 0.73-0.76) and achieved high discriminative performance in
identifying atrial EGM entanglement (AUC 0.93).
  The proposed method can operate in real-time and enables integration into
clinical electroanatomical mapping systems to assist in identifying
arrhythmogenic regions during ablation procedures. This work highlights the
potential of unsupervised learning to uncover physiologically meaningful
features from intracardiac signals.

*Jesus S. Aguilar-Ruiz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Irredundant k-fold cross-validation, which uses each instance exactly once for training and testing, addressing redundancy of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the redundancy issue in traditional k-fold cross-validation, where instances disproportionately influence training, potentially leading to overfitting and unbalanced dataset utilization.

Method: The proposed method ensures each instance is utilized exactly once for training and testing while maintaining stratification and model-agnostic architecture.

Result: The method achieves performance estimates comparable to k-fold cross-validation, with less optimistic variance estimates, non-overlapping training partitions, and lower computational costs.

Conclusion: Irredundant k-fold cross-validation is a superior alternative to traditional methods, offering balanced data usage and efficient computations without sacrificing performance estimates.

Abstract: In traditional k-fold cross-validation, each instance is used ($k-1$) times
for training and once for testing, leading to redundancy that lets many
instances disproportionately influence the learning phase. We introduce
Irredundant $k$-fold cross-validation, a novel method that guarantees each
instance is used exactly once for training and once for testing across the
entire validation procedure. This approach ensures a more balanced utilization
of the dataset, mitigates overfitting due to instance repetition, and enables
sharper distinctions in comparative model analysis. The method preserves
stratification and remains model-agnostic, i.e., compatible with any
classifier. Experimental results demonstrate that it delivers consistent
performance estimates across diverse datasets -- comparable to $k$-fold
cross-validation -- while providing less optimistic variance estimates because
training partitions are non-overlapping, and significantly reducing the overall
computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning is computationally intensive and power-hungry, creating demand for alternative implementations utilizing physical systems to reduce energy consumption.

Method: The authors propose the BEASTAL algorithm, where physical systems learn autonomously through boundary-controlled parameters and follow local evolution rules inspired by physical principles.

Result: BEASTAL demonstrated successful application in simulation for regression and classification tasks, performing optimally when local evolution rules had non-linear characteristics.

Conclusion: BEASTAL offers an efficient physical learning mechanism that simplifies design by leveraging local physical rules, avoiding the need for large-scale memory and intricate internal architectures.

Abstract: Machine Learning, however popular and accessible, is computationally
intensive and highly power-consuming, prompting interest in alternative
physical implementations of learning tasks. We introduce a training scheme for
physical systems that minimize power dissipation in which only boundary
parameters (i.e. inputs and outputs) are externally controlled. Using this
scheme, these Boundary-Enabled Adaptive State Tuning Systems (BEASTS) learn by
exploiting local physical rules. Our scheme, BEASTAL (BEAST-Adaline), is the
closest analog of the Adaline algorithm for such systems. We demonstrate this
autonomous learning in silico for regression and classification tasks. Our
approach advances previous physical learning schemes by using intuitive, local
evolution rules without requiring large-scale memory or complex internal
architectures. BEASTAL can perform any linear task, achieving best performance
when the local evolution rule is non-linear.

Method: Two approaches are proposed: (1) a conformal prediction method for high-dimensional state MDPs to establish confidence intervals for particular initial states, and (2) the application of doubly robust estimation and prediction-powered inference to build intervals for average policy performance.

Result: The methods consistently generate valid confidence intervals that include ground truth values across various domains such as robotics, healthcare, inventory management, and a realistic healthcare dataset (MIMIC-IV).

Conclusion: Valid and trustworthy confidence intervals for augmented data in OPE are achievable, improving practical utility and reliability in high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) methods aim to estimate the value of a new
reinforcement learning (RL) policy prior to deployment. Recent advances have
shown that leveraging auxiliary datasets, such as those synthesized by
generative models, can improve the accuracy of these value estimates.
Unfortunately, such auxiliary datasets may also be biased, and existing methods
for using data augmentation for OPE in RL lack principled uncertainty
quantification. In high stakes settings like healthcare, reliable uncertainty
estimates are important for comparing policy value estimates. In this work, we
propose two approaches to construct valid confidence intervals for OPE when
using data augmentation. The first provides a confidence interval over the
policy performance conditioned on a particular initial state $V^{\pi}(s_0)$--
such intervals are particularly important for human-centered applications. To
do so we introduce a new conformal prediction method for high dimensional state
MDPs. Second, we consider the more common task of estimating the average policy
performance over many initial states; to do so we draw on ideas from doubly
robust estimation and prediction powered inference. Across simulators spanning
robotics, healthcare and inventory management, and a real healthcare dataset
from MIMIC-IV, we find that our methods can use augmented data and still
consistently produce intervals that cover the ground truth values, unlike
previously proposed methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for learning graph structures using geometric analysis and nonlinear dynamics, focusing on stability, generalization, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve learning of hidden graph structures in data by addressing topological correctness, metric convergence, and efficient space use.

Method: The framework involves defining discrete Sobolev spaces on graphs, proposing gauge-equivalent nonlinear dynamics, and developing a stochastic gradient algorithm with sparsity regularization.

Result: The method ensures homology recovery, Gromov--Hausdorff metric convergence, and enhanced generalization bounds compared to standard neural networks.

Conclusion: This approach offers a theoretically grounded, efficient, and robust way of learning graph structures that generalizes better over data manifolds.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for learning hidden graph structures from data
using geometric analysis and nonlinear dynamics. Our approach: (1) Defines
discrete Sobolev spaces on graphs for scalar/vector fields, establishing key
functional properties; (2) Introduces gauge-equivalent nonlinear Schr\"odinger
and Landau--Lifshitz dynamics with provable stable stationary solutions
smoothly dependent on input data and graph weights; (3) Develops a stochastic
gradient algorithm over graph moduli spaces with sparsity regularization.
Theoretically, we guarantee: topological correctness (homology recovery),
metric convergence (Gromov--Hausdorff), and efficient search space utilization.
Our dynamics-based model achieves stronger generalization bounds than standard
neural networks, with complexity dependent on the data manifold's topology.

*Ziyi Liang,Annie Qu,Babak Shahbaba*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Meta Fusion, a framework that unifies existing multimodal data fusion strategies to improve predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving predictive power through better multimodal data fusion strategies, which are crucial across applications like autonomous driving and medical diagnosis.

Method: Meta Fusion creates a cohort of models using latent representations from different modalities. It employs soft information sharing for enhanced performance and utilizes a model-agnostic approach for adaptability.

Result: Meta Fusion consistently surpasses traditional fusion techniques, as demonstrated through simulations and real-world applications in Alzheimer's disease detection and neural decoding.

Conclusion: Meta Fusion is a flexible, effective framework that enhances multimodal data fusion by reducing generalization error and achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal data fusion strategies has become
increasingly essential for improving the predictive power of statistical
machine learning methods across a wide range of applications, from autonomous
driving to medical diagnosis. Traditional fusion methods, including early,
intermediate, and late fusion, integrate data at different stages, each
offering distinct advantages and limitations. In this paper, we introduce Meta
Fusion, a flexible and principled framework that unifies these existing
strategies as special cases. Motivated by deep mutual learning and ensemble
learning, Meta Fusion constructs a cohort of models based on various
combinations of latent representations across modalities, and further boosts
predictive performance through soft information sharing within the cohort. Our
approach is model-agnostic in learning the latent representations, allowing it
to flexibly adapt to the unique characteristics of each modality.
Theoretically, our soft information sharing mechanism reduces the
generalization error. Empirically, Meta Fusion consistently outperforms
conventional fusion strategies in extensive simulation studies. We further
validate our approach on real-world applications, including Alzheimer's disease
detection and neural decoding.

*Tony Shaska Sr*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Graded Transformer framework introduces two new sequence models, LGT and EGT, leveraging algebraic principles to enhance structured data handling and enable hierarchical learning across a variety of domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate algebraic inductive biases and enable hierarchical, efficient representation learning for structured data, addressing limitations in existing fixed-grade models.

Method: Proposes the Linearly Graded Transformer (LGT) and Exponentially Graded Transformer (EGT). These models employ parameterized grading transformations, universal approximation guarantees, and a graded loss function for optimization. Differentiable grades allow adaptive feature prioritization.

Result: The models demonstrate theoretical guarantees such as universal function approximation, reduced sample complexity, robustness to adversarial perturbations, and gradient stability.

Conclusion: The Graded Transformer advances structured deep learning by blending geometric and algebraic principles with attention mechanisms, enhancing interpretability and efficiency in complex learning domains.

Abstract: We introduce the Graded Transformer framework, a novel class of sequence
models that embeds algebraic inductive biases through grading transformations
on vector spaces. Extending the theory of Graded Neural Networks (GNNs), we
propose two architectures: the Linearly Graded Transformer (LGT) and the
Exponentially Graded Transformer (EGT). These models apply parameterized
scaling operators-governed by fixed or learnable grading tuples and, for EGT,
exponential factors to infuse hierarchical structure into attention and
representation layers, enhancing efficiency for structured data.
  We derive rigorous theoretical guarantees, including universal approximation
theorems for continuous and Sobolev functions, reduced sample complexity via
effective VC dimension bounds, Lipschitz continuity of graded operations, and
robustness to adversarial perturbations. A graded loss function ensures
gradient stability and alignment with domain priors during optimization. By
treating grades as differentiable parameters, the framework enables adaptive
feature prioritization, overcoming limitations of fixed grades in prior work.
  The Graded Transformer holds transformative potential for hierarchical
learning and neurosymbolic reasoning, with applications spanning algebraic
geometry (e.g., moduli spaces and zeta functions), physics (e.g., multiscale
simulations), natural language processing (e.g., syntactic parsing), biological
sequence analysis (e.g., variant prediction), and emerging areas like graph
neural networks and financial modeling. This work advances structured deep
learning by fusing geometric and algebraic principles with attention
mechanisms, offering a mathematically grounded alternative to data-driven
models and paving the way for interpretable, efficient systems in complex
domains.

*Bermet Burkanova,Payam Jome Yazdian,Chuxuan Zhang,Trinity Evans,Paige Tuttösí,Angelica Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents CoMPAS3D, a motion capture dataset of salsa dancing, aimed at advancing humanoid AI's ability to interact through movement and timing. It includes professional annotations, benchmarks, and a multitask model for partner dance simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop humanoid AI capable of human-like interaction that goes beyond text and voice to include physical coordination, movement, and timing. Partnered dance, a highly interactive activity, serves as an ideal testbed for such systems.

Method: The authors created a large motion capture dataset (CoMPAS3D) of 3 hours of salsa dancing, spanning various skill levels, and provided detailed annotations. They also proposed benchmark tasks analogous to natural language problems and developed SalsaAgent, a multitask model to tackle these tasks.

Result: The CoMPAS3D dataset has been benchmarked for two tasks: generating motion for a leader or follower and duet generation. An AI model, SalsaAgent, was introduced, demonstrating capabilities in these tasks alongside other baselines.

Conclusion: CoMPAS3D sets a new standard for studying interactive humanoid AI, paving the way for embodied systems that can socially and physically interact with humans. It fosters research in expressive AI and creative humanoid motion generation.

Abstract: Imagine a humanoid that can safely and creatively dance with a human,
adapting to its partner's proficiency, using haptic signaling as a primary form
of communication. While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based
interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond
text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling
coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is
continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We
present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of
improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive,
expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa
dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and
professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa
expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types,
combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies
between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D
on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in
spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with
proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation)
generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release
the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model
capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to
encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive
humanoid motion generation.

*Tianyi Xu,Yiting Chen,Henger Li,Zheyong Bian,Emiliano Dall'Anese,Zizhan Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the PUCS framework for sequential decision-making with costly probing and proposes algorithms for both offline and online settings, supported by theoretical guarantees and real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequential decision-making often involves scenarios where both resources and rewards are initially unknown, and acquiring extra information (probing) comes at a cost. This is common in applications like ridesharing, wireless scheduling, and content recommendation.

Method: An offline greedy probing algorithm with a constant-factor approximation guarantee for known distributions, and OLPA, an online stochastic combinatorial bandit algorithm, are proposed to address PUCS. Theoretical bounds on performance and regret are derived.

Result: The offline algorithm achieves a constant-factor guarantee, while the online algorithm attains a regret bound tight up to logarithmic factors. Real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Conclusion: The PUCS framework and its algorithms offer effective solutions for sequential decision-making with information acquisition, supported by both theoretical insights and experimental validation.

Abstract: We formalize sequential decision-making with information acquisition as the
probing-augmented user-centric selection (PUCS) framework, where a learner
first probes a subset of arms to obtain side information on resources and
rewards, and then assigns $K$ plays to $M$ arms. PUCS covers applications such
as ridesharing, wireless scheduling, and content recommendation, in which both
resources and payoffs are initially unknown and probing is costly. For the
offline setting with known distributions, we present a greedy probing algorithm
with a constant-factor approximation guarantee $\zeta = (e-1)/(2e-1)$. For the
online setting with unknown distributions, we introduce OLPA, a stochastic
combinatorial bandit algorithm that achieves a regret bound
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} + \ln^{2} T)$. We also prove a lower bound
$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$, showing that the upper bound is tight up to logarithmic
factors. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our
solutions.

*Robert Frenken,Sidra Ghayour Bhatti,Hanqin Zhang,Qadeer Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces KD-GAT, a framework combining Graph Attention Networks and Knowledge Distillation for securing in-vehicle communication under CAN protocol, achieving high accuracy despite reduced computational size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inherent vulnerability of the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol used in vehicle communication systems that lack security mechanisms, posing a risk to cybersecurity.

Method: The paper transforms CAN traffic into graph representations using sliding windows and trains compact Graph Attention Networks (GATs) via supervised pretraining and knowledge distillation techniques.

Result: The proposed KD-GAT framework achieves high accuracy, with a compact model reaching 99.97% accuracy on Car-Hacking and 99.31% on Car-Survival datasets but struggles with class imbalance in the can-train-and-test dataset.

Conclusion: KD-GAT shows promise in improving security in CAN networks with reduced computational complexity but further work is needed to address performance issues caused by dataset imbalances.

Abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is widely adopted for in-vehicle
communication but lacks inherent security mechanisms, making it vulnerable to
cyberattacks. This paper introduces KD-GAT, an intrusion detection framework
that combines Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with knowledge distillation (KD)
to enhance detection accuracy while reducing computational complexity. In our
approach, CAN traffic is represented as graphs using a sliding window to
capture temporal and relational patterns. A multi-layer GAT with jumping
knowledge aggregation acting as the teacher model, while a compact student
GAT--only 6.32% the size of the teacher--is trained via a two-phase process
involving supervised pretraining and knowledge distillation with both soft and
hard label supervision. Experiments on three benchmark datasets--Car-Hacking,
Car-Survival, and can-train-and-test demonstrate that both teacher and student
models achieve strong results, with the student model attaining 99.97% and
99.31% accuracy on Car-Hacking and Car-Survival, respectively. However,
significant class imbalance in can-train-and-test has led to reduced
performance for both models on this dataset. Addressing this imbalance remains
an important direction for future work.

*Yazeed Alrubyli,Omar Alomeir,Abrar Wafa,Diána Hidvégi,Hend Alrasheed,Mohsen Bahrami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NAICS-aware GraphSAGE, a graph neural network that uses business taxonomy to predict co-visitation patterns across venues, significantly improving predictions compared to spatial-only models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding population movement between businesses is essential for applications like urban planning and retail analytics. Traditional spatial models fail to account for business semantics, which are key to explaining customer flow patterns.

Method: The new method, NAICS-aware GraphSAGE, incorporates business taxonomy knowledge using learnable embeddings. It combines spatial, temporal, and socioeconomic data within a graph neural network and processes large datasets efficiently through a state-wise decomposition approach.

Result: On a dataset with 94.9 million co-visitation records, the method demonstrated significant predictive improvements, with an R-squared increase from 0.243 to 0.625 and a 32% improvement in ranking quality (NDCG@10).

Conclusion: Incorporating detailed industry codes (business semantics) in predictive models allows for better understanding of customer co-visitation patterns, paving the way for advancements in urban planning and retail analytics.

Abstract: Understanding where people go after visiting one business is crucial for
urban planning, retail analytics, and location-based services. However,
predicting these co-visitation patterns across millions of venues remains
challenging due to extreme data sparsity and the complex interplay between
spatial proximity and business relationships. Traditional approaches using only
geographic distance fail to capture why coffee shops attract different customer
flows than fine dining restaurants, even when co-located. We introduce
NAICS-aware GraphSAGE, a novel graph neural network that integrates business
taxonomy knowledge through learnable embeddings to predict population-scale
co-visitation patterns. Our key insight is that business semantics, captured
through detailed industry codes, provide crucial signals that pure spatial
models cannot explain. The approach scales to massive datasets (4.2 billion
potential venue pairs) through efficient state-wise decomposition while
combining spatial, temporal, and socioeconomic features in an end-to-end
framework. Evaluated on our POI-Graph dataset comprising 94.9 million
co-visitation records across 92,486 brands and 48 US states, our method
achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines: the
R-squared value increases from 0.243 to 0.625 (a 157 percent improvement), with
strong gains in ranking quality (32 percent improvement in NDCG at 10).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel method to use limited calibration data efficiently for fine-tuning predictors and bias estimation of synthetic labels, ensuring reliable predictions for AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibration data scarcity makes it challenging to quantify the uncertainty of AI decisions, especially when relying on synthetic labels that may have biases.

Method: The method uses a limited amount of calibration data to simultaneously fine-tune a prediction model and estimate residual bias in synthetic labels, improving prediction accuracy.

Result: The proposed approach provides reliable prediction sets with coverage guarantees and demonstrates effectiveness in an indoor localization problem.

Conclusion: The paper's approach addresses calibration data scarcity while improving prediction reliability and accuracy through efficient use of synthetic labels.

Abstract: Calibration data are necessary to formally quantify the uncertainty of the
decisions produced by an existing artificial intelligence (AI) model. To
overcome the common issue of scarce calibration data, a promising approach is
to employ synthetic labels produced by a (generally different) predictive
model. However, fine-tuning the label-generating predictor on the inference
task of interest, as well as estimating the residual bias of the synthetic
labels, demand additional data, potentially exacerbating the calibration data
scarcity problem. This paper introduces a novel approach that efficiently
utilizes limited calibration data to simultaneously fine-tune a predictor and
estimate the bias of the synthetic labels. The proposed method yields
prediction sets with rigorous coverage guarantees for AI-generated decisions.
Experimental results on an indoor localization problem validate the
effectiveness and performance gains of our solution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework using disjoint generative models to create synthetic datasets, prioritizing privacy with minimal utility loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for enhanced privacy in generating synthetic datasets without significantly compromising their usefulness.

Method: The method involves partitioning datasets into disjoint subsets provided to separate generative models, later combined without using common variables or identifiers.

Result: Case studies demonstrate the framework's advantages, including better privacy, feasibility for certain model types, and potential for mixed-model synthesis.

Conclusion: Disjoint generative models offer increased privacy at a low cost of utility, broadening feasibility and effectiveness for synthetic dataset generation.

Abstract: We propose a new framework for generating cross-sectional synthetic datasets
via disjoint generative models. In this paradigm, a dataset is partitioned into
disjoint subsets that are supplied to separate instances of generative models.
The results are then combined post hoc by a joining operation that works in the
absence of common variables/identifiers. The success of the framework is
demonstrated through several case studies and examples on tabular data that
helps illuminate some of the design choices that one may make. The principal
benefit of disjoint generative models is significantly increased privacy at
only a low utility cost. Additional findings include increased effectiveness
and feasibility for certain model types and the possibility for mixed-model
synthesis.

*Dharmesh Tailor,Alvaro H. C. Correia,Eric Nalisnick,Christos Louizos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for constructing well-calibrated and sharp prediction intervals for neural network regressors without relying on held-out data, improving on existing techniques like Laplace's method and split conformal prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification is necessary for deploying deep learning models in areas like safety-critical applications, and current post-hoc approaches have limitations such as calibration issues and inefficiency.

Method: The authors approximate full conformal prediction (full-CP) by perturbing model parameters using Gauss-Newton influence and linearizing the network, avoiding held-out data or exhaustive retraining for every test case.

Result: Empirical tests show that the proposed prediction intervals are locally adaptive and generally tighter than those achieved by split conformal prediction.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical and efficient way to achieve better-calibrated and adaptive uncertainty estimates, advancing post-hoc uncertainty quantification techniques for deep learning models.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is an important prerequisite for the deployment of
deep learning models in safety-critical areas. Yet, this hinges on the
uncertainty estimates being useful to the extent the prediction intervals are
well-calibrated and sharp. In the absence of inherent uncertainty estimates
(e.g. pretrained models predicting only point estimates), popular approaches
that operate post-hoc include Laplace's method and split conformal prediction
(split-CP). However, Laplace's method can be miscalibrated when the model is
misspecified and split-CP requires sample splitting, and thus comes at the
expense of statistical efficiency. In this work, we construct prediction
intervals for neural network regressors post-hoc without held-out data. This is
achieved by approximating the full conformal prediction method (full-CP).
Whilst full-CP nominally requires retraining the model for every test point and
candidate label, we propose to train just once and locally perturb model
parameters using Gauss-Newton influence to approximate the effect of
retraining. Coupled with linearization of the network, we express the absolute
residual nonconformity score as a piecewise linear function of the candidate
label allowing for an efficient procedure that avoids the exhaustive search
over the output space. On standard regression benchmarks and bounding box
localization, we show the resulting prediction intervals are locally-adaptive
and often tighter than those of split-CP.

*Rahul Raja,Arpita Vats*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new semantic compression-based retrieval paradigm improving on traditional methods by focusing on diversity and broader semantic understanding using graph-augmented vector retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vector database retrieval methods often miss semantic diversity and coverage, restricting their utility in applications requiring richer contextual information.

Method: The authors combine submodular optimization and information geometry principles to formalize semantic compression, leveraging graph-augmented vector retrieval to implement multi-hop, context-aware searches.

Result: The proposed approach addresses the limitations of proximity-based retrieval and demonstrates enhanced semantic coverage through graph-augmented representations.

Conclusion: This work establishes a theoretical and operational foundation for diversity-aware, hybrid indexing systems, advancing the state of vector search systems through structured semantic retrieval.

Abstract: Vector databases typically rely on approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search
to retrieve the top-k closest vectors to a query in embedding space. While
effective, this approach often yields semantically redundant results, missing
the diversity and contextual richness required by applications such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multi-hop QA, and memory-augmented
agents. We introduce a new retrieval paradigm: semantic compression, which aims
to select a compact, representative set of vectors that captures the broader
semantic structure around a query. We formalize this objective using principles
from submodular optimization and information geometry, and show that it
generalizes traditional top-k retrieval by prioritizing coverage and diversity.
To operationalize this idea, we propose graph-augmented vector retrieval, which
overlays semantic graphs (e.g., kNN or knowledge-based links) atop vector
spaces to enable multi-hop, context-aware search. We theoretically analyze the
limitations of proximity-based retrieval under high-dimensional concentration
and highlight how graph structures can improve semantic coverage. Our work
outlines a foundation for meaning-centric vector search systems, emphasizing
hybrid indexing, diversity-aware querying, and structured semantic retrieval.
We make our implementation publicly available to foster future research in this
area.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DisasterMobLLM, a framework for predicting human mobility during disaster scenarios. It leverages large language models (LLMs) and achieves significant improvements over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urbanization and climate change have increased cities' vulnerability to natural disasters, making it crucial to predict human mobility for effective disaster response.

Method: The framework uses LLMs to forecast mobility intentions and integrates them into deep learning models. It consists of three components: a RAG-Enhanced Intention Predictor, an LLM-based Intention Refiner, and an Intention-Modulated Location Predictor.

Result: Experiments show a 32.8% improvement in Acc@1 and a 35.0% improvement in the F1-score for immobility prediction compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: DisasterMobLLM efficiently predicts human mobility during disasters, demonstrating its potential to improve disaster response and resource allocation.

Abstract: The vulnerability of cities to natural disasters has increased with
urbanization and climate change, making it more important to predict human
mobility in the disaster scenarios for downstream tasks including
location-based early disaster warning and pre-allocating rescue resources, etc.
However, existing human mobility prediction models are mainly designed for
normal scenarios, and fail to adapt to disaster scenarios due to the shift of
human mobility patterns under disaster. To address this issue, we introduce
\textbf{DisasterMobLLM}, a mobility prediction framework for disaster scenarios
that can be integrated into existing deep mobility prediction methods by
leveraging LLMs to model the mobility intention and transferring the common
knowledge of how different disasters affect mobility intentions between cities.
This framework utilizes a RAG-Enhanced Intention Predictor to forecast the next
intention, refines it with an LLM-based Intention Refiner, and then maps the
intention to an exact location using an Intention-Modulated Location Predictor.
Extensive experiments illustrate that DisasterMobLLM can achieve a 32.8\%
improvement in terms of Acc@1 and a 35.0\% improvement in terms of the F1-score
of predicting immobility compared to the baselines. The code is available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, Segment Transformer, for predicting enzyme temperature stability efficiently and accurately, achieving significant experimental validation improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing enzymes with tailored thermal properties is critical for industrial and research applications, but experimental and existing computational methods face challenges due to labor intensity and data limitations.

Method: The authors curate a temperature stability dataset and propose the Segment Transformer framework that employs segment-level representations for enzyme thermal modeling.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance metrics: RMSE of 24.03, MAE of 18.09, and Pearson/Spearman correlations of 0.33. Experimental application improved enzyme activity by 1.64-fold through minimal mutations.

Conclusion: Incorporating segment-specific contributions into enzyme modeling proves effective, enabling strategic enzyme engineering with measurable improvements in thermal stability and activity.

Abstract: Developing enzymes with desired thermal properties is crucial for a wide
range of industrial and research applications, and determining temperature
stability is an essential step in this process. Experimental determination of
thermal parameters is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. Moreover,
existing computational approaches are often hindered by limited data
availability and imbalanced distributions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a curated temperature stability dataset designed for model
development and benchmarking in enzyme thermal modeling. Leveraging this
dataset, we present the \textit{Segment Transformer}, a novel deep learning
framework that enables efficient and accurate prediction of enzyme temperature
stability. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with an RMSE of
24.03, MAE of 18.09, and Pearson and Spearman correlations of 0.33,
respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating
segment-level representations, grounded in the biological observation that
different regions of a protein sequence contribute unequally to thermal
behavior. As a proof of concept, we applied the Segment Transformer to guide
the engineering of a cutinase enzyme. Experimental validation demonstrated a
1.64-fold improvement in relative activity following heat treatment, achieved
through only 17 mutations and without compromising catalytic function.

### [369] [Diagonally-Weighted Generalized Method of Moments Estimation for Gaussian Mixture Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20459)
*Liu Zhang,Oscar Mickelin,Sheng Xu,Amit Singer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method called Diagonally-Weighted Generalized Method of Moments (DGMM) to enhance parameter estimation for high-dimensional Gaussian mixtures, addressing computational inefficiencies of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like MM and GMM face computational and storage bottlenecks when dealing with high-dimensional data or higher-order moments, making them impractical for modern applications.

Method: The authors propose DGMM, which uses efficient diagonal weighting to balance statistical efficiency, computational complexity, and numerical stability, and develop an algorithm that avoids directly computing or storing moment tensors.

Result: Numerical experiments show that DGMM achieves smaller estimation errors and significantly shorter runtimes compared to MM and GMM.

Conclusion: DGMM offers an effective solution for parameter estimation in high-dimensional and weakly separated Gaussian mixtures, providing practical advantages in statistical efficiency and computational feasibility.

Abstract: Since Pearson [Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. A,
185 (1894), pp. 71-110] first applied the method of moments (MM) for modeling
data as a mixture of one-dimensional Gaussians, moment-based estimation methods
have proliferated. Among these methods, the generalized method of moments (GMM)
improves the statistical efficiency of MM by weighting the moments
appropriately. However, the computational complexity and storage complexity of
MM and GMM grow exponentially with the dimension, making these methods
impractical for high-dimensional data or when higher-order moments are
required. Such computational bottlenecks are more severe in GMM since it
additionally requires estimating a large weighting matrix. To overcome these
bottlenecks, we propose the diagonally-weighted GMM (DGMM), which achieves a
balance among statistical efficiency, computational complexity, and numerical
stability. We apply DGMM to study the parameter estimation problem for weakly
separated heteroscedastic low-rank Gaussian mixtures and design a
computationally efficient and numerically stable algorithm that obtains the
DGMM estimator without explicitly computing or storing the moment tensors. We
implement the proposed algorithm and empirically validate the advantages of

*Xin Zhang,Lissette Iturburu,Juan Nicolas Villamizar,Xiaoyu Liu,Manuel Salmeron,Shirley J. Dyke,Julio Ramirez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a generative AI-based method using large language models (LLMs) to automate generating AutoCAD structural drawings from natural language descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating structural drawings is a labor-intensive process despite advances in software, creating a need for more efficient methods to produce these drawings.

Method: The method employs a large language model using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to process natural language inputs and generate structural drawings in AutoCAD by understanding the descriptions and extracting necessary details.

Result: The approach efficiently translates natural language descriptions into AutoCAD drawings, significantly reducing manual workload and facilitating the iterative design process.

Conclusion: This AI-based approach simplifies the structural drawing generation process, saving time and effort for engineers while enhancing the communication and iteration of design ideas.

Abstract: Structural drawings are widely used in many fields, e.g., mechanical
engineering, civil engineering, etc. In civil engineering, structural drawings
serve as the main communication tool between architects, engineers, and
builders to avoid conflicts, act as legal documentation, and provide a
reference for future maintenance or evaluation needs. They are often organized
using key elements such as title/subtitle blocks, scales, plan views, elevation
view, sections, and detailed sections, which are annotated with standardized
symbols and line types for interpretation by engineers and contractors. Despite
advances in software capabilities, the task of generating a structural drawing
remains labor-intensive and time-consuming for structural engineers. Here we
introduce a novel generative AI-based method for generating structural drawings
employing a large language model (LLM) agent. The method incorporates a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique using externally-sourced facts
to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the language model. This method is
capable of understanding varied natural language descriptions, processing these
to extract necessary information, and generating code to produce the desired
structural drawing in AutoCAD. The approach developed, demonstrated and
evaluated herein enables the efficient and direct conversion of a structural
drawing's natural language description into an AutoCAD drawing, significantly
reducing the workload compared to current working process associated with
manual drawing production, facilitating the typical iterative process of
engineers for expressing design ideas in a simplified way.

### [371] [Improving Group Fairness in Tensor Completion via Imbalance Mitigating Entity Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20542)
*Dawon Ahn,Jun-Gi Jang,Evangelos E. Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STAF (Sparse Tensor Augmentation For Fairness) aims to address group fairness in tensor decomposition by reducing performance degradation and ensuring fair error distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for achieving group fairness in tensor decomposition often compromise performance, creating a need for an approach that balances fairness and tensor completion error.

Method: The proposed STAFF method augments tensors by adding extra entities with observed entries to address imbalances and biases in sparse tensors, focusing on minimizing completion and fairness-related errors.

Result: Evaluation shows STAFF achieves up to 36% lower MSE (Mean Squared Error) and 59% lower MADE (Mean Absolute Deviation Error) compared to competing methods across various conventional and deep learning-based models.

Conclusion: STAFF provides a superior trade-off between tensor completion performance and group fairness, making it a promising solution for reducing bias in tensor decomposition processes.

Abstract: Group fairness is important to consider in tensor decomposition to prevent
discrimination based on social grounds such as gender or age. Although few
works have studied group fairness in tensor decomposition, they suffer from
performance degradation. To address this, we propose STAFF(Sparse Tensor
Augmentation For Fairness) to improve group fairness by minimizing the gap in
completion errors of different groups while reducing the overall tensor
completion error. Our main idea is to augment a tensor with augmented entities
including sufficient observed entries to mitigate imbalance and group bias in
the sparse tensor. We evaluate \method on tensor completion with various
datasets under conventional and deep learning-based tensor models. STAFF
consistently shows the best trade-off between completion error and group
fairness; at most, it yields 36% lower MSE and 59% lower MADE than the
second-best baseline.

*Saram Abbas,Naeem Soomro,Rishad Shafik,Rakesh Heer,Kabita Adhikari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bladder cancer affects many globally, especially NMIBC patients with a high recurrence rate. The study introduces a transparent AI model, Tsetlin Machine (TM), which outperforms existing tools in predicting recurrence with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the outdated and unreliable clinical tools, especially for intermediate-risk NMIBC cases, and reduce the recurring cycle of surgeries and monitoring due to poor predictions.

Method: The AI model uses the Tsetlin Machine, a symbolic learner. Its performance was compared using the PHOTO trial dataset (n=330) against tools like XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and EORTC risk tables.

Result: The proposed TM model achieved an F1-score of 0.80, outperforming XGBoost (0.78), Logistic Regression (0.60), and EORTC (0.42), with predictions based on clinical features.

Conclusion: The Tsetlin Machine provides a transparent, interpretable, and effective decision-support system that improves NMIBC outcome prediction, making it suited for clinical application.

Abstract: Bladder cancer claims one life every 3 minutes worldwide. Most patients are
diagnosed with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), yet up to 70% recur
after treatment, triggering a relentless cycle of surgeries, monitoring, and
risk of progression. Clinical tools like the EORTC risk tables are outdated and
unreliable - especially for intermediate-risk cases.
  We propose an interpretable AI model using the Tsetlin Machine (TM), a
symbolic learner that outputs transparent, human-readable logic. Tested on the
PHOTO trial dataset (n=330), TM achieved an F1-score of 0.80, outperforming
XGBoost (0.78), Logistic Regression (0.60), and EORTC (0.42). TM reveals the
exact clauses behind each prediction, grounded in clinical features like tumour
count, surgeon experience, and hospital stay - offering accuracy and full
transparency. This makes TM a powerful, trustworthy decision-support tool ready
for real-world adoption.

*Youngjoon Lee,Hyukjoon Lee,Jinu Gong,Yang Cao,Joonhyuk Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights that edge-specific settings, like optimizer choice and learning rate, have a bigger impact on Federated Learning (FL) performance than the complexity of the FL method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the sensitivity of Federated Learning methods to local factors such as optimizers and learning rates, which hinders their practical deployment, especially in medical imaging.

Method: The authors conducted a benchmark study comparing recent FL methods on colorectal pathology and blood cell classification tasks to evaluate the impact of local-edge device configurations.

Result: They found that factors such as local optimizer, learning rate, and training epochs have a greater influence on performance than the actual choice of FL algorithm.

Conclusion: Appropriate configuration of edge-specific parameters is more critical than algorithmic complexity for effective Federated Learning deployment.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative learning method that enables
decentralized model training while preserving data privacy. Despite its promise
in medical imaging, recent FL methods are often sensitive to local factors such
as optimizers and learning rates, limiting their robustness in practical
deployments. In this work, we revisit vanilla FL to clarify the impact of edge
device configurations, benchmarking recent FL methods on colorectal pathology
and blood cell classification task. We numerically show that the choice of
local optimizer and learning rate has a greater effect on performance than the
specific FL method. Moreover, we find that increasing local training epochs can
either enhance or impair convergence, depending on the FL method. These
findings indicate that appropriate edge-specific configuration is more crucial
than algorithmic complexity for achieving effective FL.

### [374] [Personalized Treatment Effect Estimation from Unstructured Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20993)
*Henri Arno,Thomas Demeester*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of estimating personalized treatment effects from unstructured data and introduces methods to overcome confounding and sampling bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend causal inference methods to unstructured data like clinical notes and medical images, where traditional approaches relying on structured covariates are limited.

Method: The paper introduces a plug-in method for training on neural representations of unstructured data, two estimators that use structured measurements during training to avoid confounding bias, and a regression-based correction for sampling bias.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the plug-in method performs robustly across various settings, showing strong empirical results despite its simplicity.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches expand the applicability of causal inference to unstructured data while addressing confounding and sampling biases, proving effective in experimental settings.

Abstract: Existing methods for estimating personalized treatment effects typically rely
on structured covariates, limiting their applicability to unstructured data.
Yet, leveraging unstructured data for causal inference has considerable
application potential, for instance in healthcare, where clinical notes or
medical images are abundant. To this end, we first introduce an approximate
'plug-in' method trained directly on the neural representations of unstructured
data. However, when these fail to capture all confounding information, the
method may be subject to confounding bias. We therefore introduce two
theoretically grounded estimators that leverage structured measurements of the
confounders during training, but allow estimating personalized treatment
effects purely from unstructured inputs, while avoiding confounding bias. When
these structured measurements are only available for a non-representative
subset of the data, these estimators may suffer from sampling bias. To address
this, we further introduce a regression-based correction that accounts for the
non-uniform sampling, assuming the sampling mechanism is known or can be
well-estimated. Our experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the plug-in
method, directly trainable on large unstructured datasets, achieves strong
empirical performance across all settings, despite its simplicity.

*Tiantian Peng,Yuyang Liu,Shuo Yang,Qiuhe Hong,YongHong Tian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gradient Null Space Projection (GNSP) addresses CLIP's zero-shot generalization issues during continual learning by mitigating catastrophic forgetting and preserving embedding alignment without rehearsal or architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and degradation in embedding alignment faced by CLIP during continual fine-tuning on diverse tasks.

Method: The paper introduces GNSP, which orthogonally projects task-specific gradients to prevent interference with prior tasks, alongside knowledge distillation and a modality alignment preservation loss to stabilize embedding space.

Result: GNSP achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MTIL benchmark's metrics and preserved CLIP's cross-modal retrieval and modality gap effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively sustains CLIP's robust multimodal embedding space throughout the continual learning process.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining has demonstrated remarkable zero-shot
generalization by aligning visual and textual modalities in a shared embedding
space. However, when continuously fine-tuned on diverse tasks, CLIP suffers
from catastrophic forgetting and degradation of its embedding alignment,
undermining its zero-shot capabilities. In this work, we propose Gradient Null
Space Projection (GNSP), an efficient continual learning method that projects
task-specific gradients onto the null space of previously learned knowledge.
This orthogonal projection mathematically prevents interference with previous
tasks without relying on rehearsal or architectural modification. Furthermore,
to preserve the inherent generalization property of CLIP, we introduce
knowledge distillation and combine it with a modality alignment preservation
loss inspired by CLIP pre-training to stabilize the structure of the multimodal
embedding space during fine-tuning. On the MTIL benchmark consisting of 11
tasks, our method achieved SOTA performance on both the Average and Last key
metrics. More importantly, experiments show that our method successfully
maintains the original modality gap and cross-modal retrieval performance of
CLIP, confirming its effectiveness in maintaining a robust visual-language
space throughout the continual learning process.

*Aditya Ravuri,Neil D. Lawrence*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a probabilistic interpretation of transformers using the ProbDR framework and demonstrates improvements in validation performance via a graph diffusion step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a probabilistic interpretation of transformers and analyze their functionality through the ProbDR framework.

Method: The paper derives a probabilistic connection between transformers and a Laplacian Eigenmaps model, highlighting the role of the graph Laplacian instead of the attention matrix.

Result: It shows that transformers can achieve better validation performance in language and vision tasks by modifying the attention matrix with a graph diffusion step.

Conclusion: Transformers can be probabilistically understood as performing dimensionality reduction and graph diffusion, with potential performance improvements through simple adjustments to their attention mechanism.

Abstract: We propose a probabilistic interpretation of transformers as unrolled
inference steps assuming a probabilistic Laplacian Eigenmaps model from the
ProbDR framework. Our derivation shows that at initialisation, transformers
perform "linear" dimensionality reduction. We also show that within the
transformer block, a graph Laplacian term arises from our arguments, rather
than an attention matrix (which we interpret as an adjacency matrix). We
demonstrate that simply subtracting the identity from the attention matrix (and
thereby taking a graph diffusion step) improves validation performance on a
language model and a simple vision transformer.

### [377] [VAE-GAN Based Price Manipulation in Coordinated Local Energy Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19844)
*Biswarup Mukherjee,Li Zhou,S. Gokul Krishnan,Milad Kabirifar,Subhash Lakshminarayana,Charalambos Konstantinou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a model using reinforcement learning for energy trading coordination in local energy markets (LEMs) and examines adversarial price manipulation and its financial impact on prosumers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve energy trading coordination among diverse prosumers in local energy markets and understand the impacts of adversarial pricing.

Method: The model employs multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) for decision-making and uses a VAE-GAN framework to study adversarial price manipulations.

Result: Efficient energy trading occurs under this model. However, under adversarial pricing, certain prosumers, particularly those without generation capabilities, face financial losses. Larger markets enhance fairness and stability.

Conclusion: Coordinated energy trading can be optimized using MADDPG, but systematic vulnerabilities occur under adversarial pricing. Larger markets may mitigate financial disparities and promote fair trading.

Abstract: This paper introduces a model for coordinating prosumers with heterogeneous
distributed energy resources (DERs), participating in the local energy market
(LEM) that interacts with the market-clearing entity. The proposed LEM scheme
utilizes a data-driven, model-free reinforcement learning approach based on the
multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework, enabling
prosumers to make real-time decisions on whether to buy, sell, or refrain from
any action while facilitating efficient coordination for optimal energy trading
in a dynamic market. In addition, we investigate a price manipulation strategy
using a variational auto encoder-generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN)
model, which allows utilities to adjust price signals in a way that induces
financial losses for the prosumers. Our results show that under adversarial
pricing, heterogeneous prosumer groups, particularly those lacking generation
capabilities, incur financial losses. The same outcome holds across LEMs of
different sizes. As the market size increases, trading stabilizes and fairness
improves through emergent cooperation among agents.

TL;DR: The paper discusses using machine learning to improve problem ticket resolution in service industries, addressing issues like data drift, missing data, and ambiguous text by employing techniques such as clustering, supervised learning, and NLP models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in resolving problem tickets efficiently in service industries, especially issues like missing or ambiguous data and data drift, using robust machine learning techniques.

Method: The paper employs clustering, supervised classification using LDA, Siamese networks, One-shot learning, and Index embedding, alongside advanced NLP models, and supports results with a Kubernetes-based production deployment and real-time dashboard.

Result: Experiments conducted on both open-source and proprietary telecom data showcased high prediction accuracy in problem ticket resolution.

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively tackles key challenges in problem ticket resolution and demonstrates strong practical applicability through high accuracy and real-time deployment features.

Abstract: Resolution of incidents or problem tickets is a common theme in service
industries in any sector, including billing and charging systems in telecom
domain. Machine learning can help to identify patterns and suggest resolutions
for the problem tickets, based on patterns in the historical data of the
tickets. However, this process may be complicated due to a variety of phenomena
such as data drift and issues such as missing data, lack of data pertaining to
resolutions of past incidents, too many similar sounding resolutions due to
free text and similar sounding text. This paper proposes a robust ML-driven
solution employing clustering, supervised learning, and advanced NLP models to
tackle these challenges effectively. Building on previous work, we demonstrate
clustering-based resolution identification, supervised classification with LDA,
Siamese networks, and One-shot learning, Index embedding. Additionally, we
present a real-time dashboard and a highly available Kubernetes-based
production deployment. Our experiments with both the open-source Bitext
customer-support dataset and proprietary telecom datasets demonstrate high
prediction accuracy.

TL;DR: ARPO is a novel RL algorithm designed for LLMs to improve multi-turn reasoning tasks, achieving superior performance with efficient tool usage across diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL algorithms struggle to balance LLMs' long-horizon reasoning and their efficiency in multi-turn tool interactions.

Method: ARPO introduces an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, enabling exploration post-tool usage and integrates advantage attribution estimation for stepwise tool-use interactions.

Result: Experiments on 13 benchmarks demonstrate ARPO's superior performance, achieving better results with half the tool-use budget compared to other methods.

Conclusion: ARPO provides an effective and scalable solution for aligning LLMs with dynamic environments, optimizing reasoning and tool interaction capabilities.

Abstract: Large-scale reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has
demonstrated its effectiveness in harnessing the potential of large language
models (LLMs) for single-turn reasoning tasks. In realistic reasoning
scenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving
processes. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models'
intrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in
multi-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced
Policy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training
multi-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that
LLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in
the entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following
interactions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO
incorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing
global trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting
exploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an
advantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage
differences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13
challenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and
deep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL
algorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of
the tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution
for aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments. Our code and
datasets are released at https://github.com/dongguanting/ARPO

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to integrate physical causal reasoning into Large Language Models, achieving improved performance on physical reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLMs lack causal reasoning capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in applications requiring understanding of physical dynamics.

Method: A framework named Causal World Model Induction (CWMI) incorporates a Causal Physics Module and a training objective called Causal Intervention Loss to teach the model causal relationships.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows CWMI outperforms state-of-the-art models on physical reasoning tasks and benchmarks such as PIQA and PhysiCa-Bench.

Conclusion: Embedding causal physics within LLMs enhances their capability to handle real-world scenarios, marking progress toward generalizable AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advanced linguistic capabilities,
fundamentally lack an intuitive understanding of physical dynamics, which
limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios that require causal
reasoning. In this paper, we introduce Causal World Model Induction (CWMI), a
novel framework designed to embed an explicit model of causal physics within an
LLM. Our approach incorporates a dedicated Causal Physics Module (CPM) and a
new training objective called Causal Intervention Loss, encouraging the model
to learn cause-and-effect relationships from multimodal data. By training the
model to predict the outcomes of hypothetical interventions instead of merely
capturing statistical correlations, CWMI develops a robust internal
representation of physical laws. Experimental results show that CWMI
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on zero-shot physical reasoning
tasks, including the PIQA benchmark and our newly proposed PhysiCa-Bench
dataset. These findings demonstrate that inducing a causal world model is a
critical step toward more reliable and generalizable AI systems.

*Shishir Muralidhara,Didier Stricker,René Schuster*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CLoRA, a resource-efficient approach to continual learning (CL), which uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to address the computational challenges of training in constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual learning methods require extensive computational resources and retraining, which are impractical in real-world, resource-constrained environments.

Method: CLoRA employs Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to achieve class-incremental semantic segmentation while maintaining parameter efficiency and reusing the same small parameter set across tasks.

Result: CLoRA achieves competitive performance compared to baseline CL methods while significantly reducing hardware and computational requirements.

Conclusion: CLoRA offers an effective, resource-efficient solution for continual learning, suitable for environments with limited computation, emphasizing the need for methods that go beyond task performance to consider resource efficiency.

Abstract: In the past, continual learning (CL) was mostly concerned with the problem of
catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, that arises when incrementally
learning a sequence of tasks. Current CL methods function within the confines
of limited data access, without any restrictions imposed on computational
resources. However, in real-world scenarios, the latter takes precedence as
deployed systems are often computationally constrained. A major drawback of
most CL methods is the need to retrain the entire model for each new task. The
computational demands of retraining large models can be prohibitive, limiting
the applicability of CL in environments with limited resources. Through CLoRA,
we explore the applicability of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a
parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for class-incremental semantic
segmentation. CLoRA leverages a small set of parameters of the model and uses
the same set for learning across all tasks. Results demonstrate the efficacy of
CLoRA, achieving performance on par with and exceeding the baseline methods. We
further evaluate CLoRA using NetScore, underscoring the need to factor in
resource efficiency and evaluate CL methods beyond task performance. CLoRA
significantly reduces the hardware requirements for training, making it
well-suited for CL in resource-constrained environments after deployment.

TL;DR: This paper reviews generative model unlearning (GenMU), proposes a unified framework for its study, and outlines challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of generative models has raised privacy concerns, necessitating effective unlearning techniques. Current studies lack a unified framework, limiting fair comparisons and systematic organization.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive review of existing GenMU research, propose a unified framework to categorize unlearning objectives, methods, and evaluation metrics, and examine connections between GenMU and related techniques.

Result: A unified framework is established for GenMU research, along with an exploration of its connections to other fields like model editing and controllable generation. The paper highlights practical value and open challenges.

Conclusion: The unified framework and insights provided are intended to guide future research in GenMU, address privacy concerns, and enable further advancements.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, associated privacy concerns
have attracted growing attention. To address this, researchers have begun
adapting machine unlearning techniques from traditional classification models
to generative settings. Although notable progress has been made in this area, a
unified framework for systematically organizing and integrating existing work
is still lacking. The substantial differences among current studies in terms of
unlearning objectives and evaluation protocols hinder the objective and fair
comparison of various approaches. While some studies focus on specific types of
generative models, they often overlook the commonalities and systematic
characteristics inherent in Generative Model Unlearning (GenMU). To bridge this
gap, we provide a comprehensive review of current research on GenMU and propose
a unified analytical framework for categorizing unlearning objectives,
methodological strategies, and evaluation metrics. In addition, we explore the
connections between GenMU and related techniques, including model editing,
reinforcement learning from human feedback, and controllable generation. We
further highlight the potential practical value of unlearning techniques in
real-world applications. Finally, we identify key challenges and outline future
research directions aimed at laying a solid foundation for further advancements
in this field. We consistently maintain the related open-source materials at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a new privacy threat in federated graph learning, where malicious actors can infer data ownership through specific attacks. It proposes a framework to exploit structural and model-level cues in federated GNNs for such privacy breaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address privacy threats that arise in federated learning of graph-structured data, focusing on the ability to infer sample-to-client attribution in decentralized training environments.

Method: The authors propose a generalized attack framework targeting Federated GNNs using aggregation behaviors, gradient updates, and embedding proximity to trace data back to its originating clients.

Result: The proposed attack framework performs effectively in identifying data ownership and membership inference across multiple graph datasets within realistic federated learning setups.

Conclusion: The findings showcase a novel privacy risk in federated graph learning, emphasizing the need for designing Graph Neural Networks that are robust against client identity leakage.

Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many real-world applications, including
social networks, financial systems, and molecular biology. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto standard for learning from such data
due to their strong representation capabilities. As GNNs are increasingly
deployed in federated learning (FL) settings to preserve data locality and
privacy, new privacy threats arise from the interaction between graph
structures and decentralized training. In this paper, we present the first
systematic study of cross-client membership inference attacks (CC-MIA) against
node classification tasks of federated GNNs (FedGNNs), where a malicious client
aims to infer which client owns the given data. Unlike prior
centralized-focused work that focuses on whether a sample was included in
training, our attack targets sample-to-client attribution, a finer-grained
privacy risk unique to federated settings. We design a general attack framework
that exploits FedGNNs' aggregation behaviors, gradient updates, and embedding
proximity to link samples to their source clients across training rounds. We
evaluate our attack across multiple graph datasets under realistic FL setups.
Results show that our method achieves high performance on both membership
inference and ownership identification. Our findings highlight a new privacy
threat in federated graph learning-client identity leakage through structural
and model-level cues, motivating the need for attribution-robust GNN design.

They also provide theoretical analyses and convergence proofs.

Result: The proposed methods showed improved optimization and generalization with smaller errors than existing methods, validated via experiments on benchmark datasets like CIFAR-10/100 and Tiny ImageNet.

Conclusion: FedSWA and FedMoSWA improve FL generalization in heterogeneous data contexts, outperforming FedSAM and its variants both in theory and practice. Open source code is available for reproducibility.

Abstract: For federated learning (FL) algorithms such as FedSAM, their generalization
capability is crucial for real-word applications. In this paper, we revisit the
generalization problem in FL and investigate the impact of data heterogeneity
on FL generalization. We find that FedSAM usually performs worse than FedAvg in
the case of highly heterogeneous data, and thus propose a novel and effective
federated learning algorithm with Stochastic Weight Averaging (called
\texttt{FedSWA}), which aims to find flatter minima in the setting of highly
heterogeneous data. Moreover, we introduce a new momentum-based stochastic
controlled weight averaging FL algorithm (\texttt{FedMoSWA}), which is designed
to better align local and global models.
  Theoretically, we provide both convergence analysis and generalization bounds
for \texttt{FedSWA} and \texttt{FedMoSWA}. We also prove that the optimization
and generalization errors of \texttt{FedMoSWA} are smaller than those of their
counterparts, including FedSAM and its variants. Empirically, experimental
results on CIFAR10/100 and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed algorithms compared to their counterparts. Open source code at:

### [386] [What Can Grokking Teach Us About Learning Under Nonstationarity?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20057)
*Clare Lyle,Gharda Sokar,Razvan Pascanu,Andras Gyorgy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the feature-learning dynamics in neural networks and proposes increasing the effective learning rate to address primacy bias and improve generalization in various learning scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and address primacy bias in neural networks, which limits their ability to generalize due to early training data overshadowing later tasks, and to study the feature-learning dynamics that drive phenomena like grokking.

Method: The authors propose a method to enhance feature-learning dynamics by increasing the effective learning rate, defined as the ratio between parameter and update norms, throughout training.

Result: The proposed method is shown to improve feature-learning and generalization across multiple scenarios, including grokking, warm-starting, and reinforcement learning tasks.

Conclusion: Accelerating feature-learning dynamics by manipulating the effective learning rate offers a promising solution to address primacy bias and improve generalization in non-stationary learning problems.

Abstract: In continual learning problems, it is often necessary to overwrite components
of a neural network's learned representation in response to changes in the data
stream; however, neural networks often exhibit \primacy bias, whereby early
training data hinders the network's ability to generalize on later tasks. While
feature-learning dynamics of nonstationary learning problems are not well
studied, the emergence of feature-learning dynamics is known to drive the
phenomenon of grokking, wherein neural networks initially memorize their
training data and only later exhibit perfect generalization. This work
conjectures that the same feature-learning dynamics which facilitate
generalization in grokking also underlie the ability to overwrite previous
learned features as well, and methods which accelerate grokking by facilitating
feature-learning dynamics are promising candidates for addressing primacy bias
in non-stationary learning problems. We then propose a straightforward method
to induce feature-learning dynamics as needed throughout training by increasing
the effective learning rate, i.e. the ratio between parameter and update norms.
We show that this approach both facilitates feature-learning and improves
generalization in a variety of settings, including grokking, warm-starting
neural network training, and reinforcement learning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scheme using shifts to preserve model privacy in federated learning by complicating parameter estimation for eavesdroppers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevent eavesdropping and protect model updates during federated learning by introducing privacy-preserving mechanisms.

Method: Introduce shifts into model updates and derive the Fisher Information matrix, driving it to singularity, alongside a convergence test to ensure untampered updates.

Result: The scheme achieves better model privacy with higher shift and lesser bandwidth requirements than noise injection methods.

Conclusion: Shifts effectively improve privacy against eavesdroppers in federated learning while preserving model accuracy and reducing bandwidth usage.

Abstract: In this paper, shifts are introduced to preserve model privacy against an
eavesdropper in federated learning. Model learning is treated as a parameter
estimation problem. This perspective allows us to derive the Fisher Information
matrix of the model updates from the shifted updates and drive them to
singularity, thus posing a hard estimation problem for Eve. The shifts are
securely shared with the central server to maintain model accuracy at the
server and participating devices. A convergence test is proposed to detect if
model updates have been tampered with and we show that our scheme passes this
test. Numerical results show that our scheme achieves a higher model shift when
compared to a noise injection scheme while requiring a lesser bandwidth secret
channel.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flow Policy Optimization (FPO) integrates flow matching into reinforcement learning by introducing an advantage-weighted ratio compatible with PPO-clip and uses flow-based generative models for improved performance in continuous control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To utilize the generative power of flow-based models in reinforcement learning to better handle high-dimensional action distributions and improve policy optimization.

Method: FPO reformulates policy optimization using the conditional flow matching loss within the PPO-clip framework, avoiding exact likelihood computation and allowing flexibility in choosing diffusion or flow methods.

Result: FPO trains diffusion-style policies effectively on continuous control tasks, demonstrating the ability to capture multimodal action distributions and outperform Gaussian policies in under-conditioned scenarios.

Conclusion: FPO provides a versatile and efficient approach to integrate flow-based generative models in reinforcement learning, achieving higher performance in challenging control tasks while being method-agnostic at training and inference stages.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models, including diffusion models, excel at modeling
continuous distributions in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we introduce
Flow Policy Optimization (FPO), a simple on-policy reinforcement learning
algorithm that brings flow matching into the policy gradient framework. FPO
casts policy optimization as maximizing an advantage-weighted ratio computed
from the conditional flow matching loss, in a manner compatible with the
popular PPO-clip framework. It sidesteps the need for exact likelihood
computation while preserving the generative capabilities of flow-based models.
Unlike prior approaches for diffusion-based reinforcement learning that bind
training to a specific sampling method, FPO is agnostic to the choice of
diffusion or flow integration at both training and inference time. We show that
FPO can train diffusion-style policies from scratch in a variety of continuous
control tasks. We find that flow-based models can capture multimodal action
distributions and achieve higher performance than Gaussian policies,
particularly in under-conditioned settings.

*Saba Ahmadi,Avrim Blum,Haifeng Xu,Fan Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of balancing freedom of speech and social distortion in social media content moderation using mechanism design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of user-generated content on social media platforms has led to challenges in moderating harmful or manipulative content while maintaining user freedom of expression.

Method: The authors approach the problem using mechanism design to optimize the balance between minimizing content manipulation and maximizing free speech. They propose practical approximation methods to solve this NP-hard problem.

Result: The proposed methods approximate the optimal trade-off between reducing social distortion and ensuring freedom of expression. Additionally, the authors provide generalization guarantees for determining the offline data needed for effective moderation.

Conclusion: The study offers a structured approach to enhance automated content moderation, focusing on balancing expression and social distortion effectively through mechanism design.

Abstract: User-generated content (UGC) on social media platforms is vulnerable to
incitements and manipulations, necessitating effective regulations. To address
these challenges, those platforms often deploy automated content moderators
tasked with evaluating the harmfulness of UGC and filtering out content that
violates established guidelines. However, such moderation inevitably gives rise
to strategic responses from users, who strive to express themselves within the
confines of guidelines. Such phenomena call for a careful balance between: 1.
ensuring freedom of speech -- by minimizing the restriction of expression; and
2. reducing social distortion -- measured by the total amount of content
manipulation. We tackle the problem of optimizing this balance through the lens
of mechanism design, aiming at optimizing the trade-off between minimizing
social distortion and maximizing free speech. Although determining the optimal
trade-off is NP-hard, we propose practical methods to approximate the optimal
solution. Additionally, we provide generalization guarantees determining the
amount of finite offline data required to approximate the optimal moderator
effectively.

*Xinyi Li,Zongyi Li,Nikola Kovachki,Anima Anandkumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimal transport-based approach for embedding complex geometries into operator learning models for solving PDEs, yielding performance improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current geometric learning methods for PDEs on complex domains require improved approaches to handle high variability and computational demands efficiently, especially when dealing with 3D surface computations.

Method: The method formulates geometry embedding as an optimal transport problem, mapping mesh density functions to uniform density in reference space, enabling instance-dependent deformation for enhanced usability. Surface geometries are embedded into a 2D latent space for computational operations.

Result: The approach achieves better accuracy and reduced computational cost (time and memory) compared to existing methods across multiple datasets like ShapeNet-Car, DrivAerNet-Car, and FlowBench.

Conclusion: Optimal transport and instance-dependent deformation enable significant gains in accuracy and efficiency when solving PDEs on complex geometries, validating its practicality for real-world problems involving variable datasets.

Abstract: We propose integrating optimal transport (OT) into operator learning for
partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex geometries. Classical
geometric learning methods typically represent domains as meshes, graphs, or
point clouds. Our approach generalizes discretized meshes to mesh density
functions, formulating geometry embedding as an OT problem that maps these
functions to a uniform density in a reference space. Compared to previous
methods relying on interpolation or shared deformation, our OT-based method
employs instance-dependent deformation, offering enhanced flexibility and
effectiveness. For 3D simulations focused on surfaces, our OT-based neural
operator embeds the surface geometry into a 2D parameterized latent space. By
performing computations directly on this 2D representation of the surface
manifold, it achieves significant computational efficiency gains compared to
volumetric simulation. Experiments with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes
equations (RANS) on the ShapeNet-Car and DrivAerNet-Car datasets show that our
method achieves better accuracy and also reduces computational expenses in
terms of both time and memory usage compared to existing machine learning
models. Additionally, our model demonstrates significantly improved accuracy on
the FlowBench dataset, underscoring the benefits of employing
instance-dependent deformation for datasets with highly variable geometries.

TL;DR: Sparse Equation Matching (SEM) offers a new framework for equation discovery using integral-based sparse regression that avoids reliance on derivatives, showcasing its utility in analyzing EEG data for brain connectivity insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve equation discovery beyond current limitations like dependency on derivatives and restriction to first-order dynamical systems, enhancing applicability in real-world scenarios.

Method: SEM employs an integral-based sparse regression approach using Green's functions for derivative-free estimation in general-order dynamical systems.

Result: SEM outperforms existing derivative-based methods in simulations and shows effectiveness in analyzing EEG data, identifying active brain regions and task-specific connectivity patterns.

Conclusion: SEM provides a robust and generalized approach to equation discovery, expanding the practical applicability to complex dynamical systems and contributing insights into brain connectivity.

Abstract: Equation discovery is a fundamental learning task for uncovering the
underlying dynamics of complex systems, with wide-ranging applications in areas
such as brain connectivity analysis, climate modeling, gene regulation, and
physical system simulation. However, many existing approaches rely on accurate
derivative estimation and are limited to first-order dynamical systems,
restricting their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we
propose sparse equation matching (SEM), a unified framework that encompasses
several existing equation discovery methods under a common formulation. SEM
introduces an integral-based sparse regression method using Green's functions,
enabling derivative-free estimation of differential operators and their
associated driving functions in general-order dynamical systems. The
effectiveness of SEM is demonstrated through extensive simulations,
benchmarking its performance against derivative-based approaches. We then apply
SEM to electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded during multiple oculomotor
tasks, collected from 52 participants in a brain-computer interface experiment.
Our method identifies active brain regions across participants and reveals
task-specific connectivity patterns. These findings offer valuable insights
into brain connectivity and the underlying neural mechanisms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new framework, Cluster Purge Loss, is proposed to improve classification tasks by fine-tuning embedding spaces for nuanced semantic relationships, achieving state-of-the-art results in equivalent code mutant detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacy of common fine-tuning methods (distance-based approaches or classification heads) in structuring embedding spaces for nuanced semantic relationships in code processing, particularly in equivalent code mutant detection.

Method: The paper introduces Cluster Purge Loss, integrating cross-entropy loss with deep metric learning to enhance intra-class semantic relationships by fine-tuning embeddings using dynamically adjusted borders.

Result: The approach, based on UniXCoder, achieves state-of-the-art performance in equivalent code mutant detection and offers a clearer, more interpretable embedding space.

Conclusion: Cluster Purge Loss enhances the ability of pre-trained models to differentiate nuanced intra-class relationships, improving performance and interpretability, particularly in equivalent code mutant detection.

Abstract: Recent pre-trained transformer models achieve superior performance in various
code processing objectives. However, although effective at optimizing decision
boundaries, common approaches for fine-tuning them for downstream
classification tasks - distance-based methods or training an additional
classification head - often fail to thoroughly structure the embedding space to
reflect nuanced intra-class semantic relationships. Equivalent code mutant
detection is one of these tasks, where the quality of the embedding space is
crucial to the performance of the models. We introduce a novel framework that
integrates cross-entropy loss with a deep metric learning objective, termed
Cluster Purge Loss. This objective, unlike conventional approaches,
concentrates on adjusting fine-grained differences within each class,
encouraging the separation of instances based on semantical equivalency to the
class center using dynamically adjusted borders. Employing UniXCoder as the
base model, our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in the
domain of equivalent mutant detection and produces a more interpretable
embedding space.

TL;DR: EcoTransformer introduces a Laplacian kernel-based convolution mechanism to replace the traditional scaled dot-product attention in Transformers, achieving competitive or better performance across tasks while reducing energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce computational intensity and energy usage associated with scaled dot-product attention in Transformer architectures.

Method: Replaces dot-product attention scoring with a Laplacian kernel-based convolution method, using L1 metric distances between queries and keys to calculate attention scores.

Result: Achieves comparable or superior task performance in NLP, bioinformatics, and vision, with significantly lower energy usage than traditional methods.

Conclusion: EcoTransformer offers an energy-efficient alternative to traditional Transformers without sacrificing performance, leveraging a novel attention mechanism to address computational and environmental concerns.

Abstract: The Transformer, with its scaled dot-product attention mechanism, has become
a foundational architecture in modern AI. However, this mechanism is
computationally intensive and incurs substantial energy costs. We propose a new
Transformer architecture EcoTransformer, in which the output context vector is
constructed as the convolution of the values using a Laplacian kernel, where
the distances are measured by the L1 metric between the queries and keys.
Compared to dot-product based attention, the new attention score calculation is
free of matrix multiplication. It performs on par with, or even surpasses,
scaled dot-product attention in NLP, bioinformatics, and vision tasks, while
consuming significantly less energy.

TL;DR: The paper utilizes UV-Vis spectroscopy and machine learning to predict grape juice attributes and classify wine origins, achieving over 91% accuracy with SVM while identifying key influential wavelengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to find a simpler alternative for wine analysis by combining spectroscopy with machine learning to address sensory data and origin classification challenges.

Method: The research employed UV-Vis spectroscopy for spectral fingerprinting and applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) for robust attribute and origin predictions.

Result: SVM achieved over 91% accuracy and F1 score in predicting wine origin while identifying influential wavelengths between 250-420 nm.

Conclusion: The findings advocate for the adoption of spectral fingerprinting and AI in winemaking, offering innovative ideas for the development of Smart Wineries and IoT integration in wine analysis.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to use absorbance data obtained by human tasting
and an ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) scanning spectrophotometer to predict the
attributes of grape juice (GJ) and to classify the wine's origin, respectively.
The approach combined machine learning (ML) techniques with spectroscopy to
find a relatively simple way to apply them in two stages of winemaking and help
improve the traditional wine analysis methods regarding sensory data and wine's
origins. This new technique has overcome the disadvantages of the complex
sensors by taking advantage of spectral fingerprinting technology and forming a
comprehensive study of the employment of AI in the wine analysis domain. In the
results, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was the most efficient and robust in both
attributes and origin prediction tasks. Both the accuracy and F1 score of the
origin prediction exceed 91%. The feature ranking approach found that the more
influential wavelengths usually appear at the lower end of the scan range, 250
nm (nanometers) to 420 nm, which is believed to be of great help for selecting
appropriate validation methods and sensors to extract wine data in future
research. The knowledge of this research provides new ideas and early solutions
for the wine industry or other beverage industries to integrate big data and
IoT in the future, which significantly promotes the development of 'Smart

*Xuanting Xie,Bingheng Li,Erlin Pan,Zhao Kang,Wenyu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework, Aggregation-aware Multilayer Perceptron (AMLP), to address the limitations of fixed aggregation methods in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), especially under heterophily, using an unsupervised approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed aggregator functions in existing GNNs, such as Mean, Max, or Sum, struggle under heterophily and often rely heavily on labeled data, creating performance and adaptability issues.

Method: The authors introduce AMLP, which employs a graph reconstruction method for high-order grouping effects and a single-layer network that encodes varying degrees of heterophily, without relying on supervision.

Result: AMLP enhances adaptability and performance, as demonstrated by extensive experiments on node clustering and classification tasks, outperforming traditional GNN approaches.

Conclusion: AMLP offers an unsupervised, lightweight solution for aggregating functions in GNNs, improving their capacity and applicability in various graph learning scenarios.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a dominant approach to learning
graph representations, primarily because of their message-passing mechanisms.
However, GNNs typically adopt a fixed aggregator function such as Mean, Max, or
Sum without principled reasoning behind the selection. This rigidity,
especially in the presence of heterophily, often leads to poor, problem
dependent performance. Although some attempts address this by designing more
sophisticated aggregation functions, these methods tend to rely heavily on
labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world tasks. In this work, we
propose a novel unsupervised framework, "Aggregation-aware Multilayer
Perceptron" (AMLP), which shifts the paradigm from directly crafting
aggregation functions to making MLP adaptive to aggregation. Our lightweight
approach consists of two key steps: First, we utilize a graph reconstruction
method that facilitates high-order grouping effects, and second, we employ a
single-layer network to encode varying degrees of heterophily, thereby
improving the capacity and applicability of the model. Extensive experiments on
node clustering and classification demonstrate the superior performance of
AMLP, highlighting its potential for diverse graph learning scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models have advanced many fields but remain limited in structure-based drug design (SBDD) due to data constraints.

Method: MEVO integrates VQ-VAE for molecular representation, a diffusion model for guided molecule generation, and a pocket-aware evolutionary strategy for optimization.

Result: MEVO efficiently generates molecules with high binding affinity, validated via free energy perturbation (FEP), and designed potent inhibitors to KRAS$^{G12D}.

Conclusion: MEVO is a versatile and data-efficient framework for structure-based ligand design, addressing SBDD data limitations effectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models, particularly diffusion and
auto-regressive models, have revolutionized fields like computer vision and
natural language processing. However, their application to structure-based drug
design (SBDD) remains limited due to critical data constraints. To address the
limitation of training data for models targeting SBDD tasks, we propose an
evolutionary framework named MEVO, which bridges the gap between billion-scale
small molecule dataset and the scarce protein-ligand complex dataset, and
effectively increase the abundance of training data for generative SBDD models.
MEVO is composed of three key components: a high-fidelity VQ-VAE for molecule
representation in latent space, a diffusion model for pharmacophore-guided
molecule generation, and a pocket-aware evolutionary strategy for molecule
optimization with physics-based scoring function. This framework efficiently
generate high-affinity binders for various protein targets, validated with
predicted binding affinities using free energy perturbation (FEP) methods. In
addition, we showcase the capability of MEVO in designing potent inhibitors to
KRAS$^{\textrm{G12D}}$, a challenging target in cancer therapeutics, with
similar affinity to the known highly active inhibitor evaluated by FEP
calculations. With high versatility and generalizability, MEVO offers an
effective and data-efficient model for various tasks in structure-based ligand
design.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Architecture Suggesting Neural Network (ASNN), a model that predicts high-performing neural network architectures based on training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing neural network architectures is largely heuristic since there is no closed-form function relating performance to structure. This study aims to automate and optimize that process.

Method: ASNN is trained using TensorFlow data of 2-layer and 3-layer architectures across varying configurations, treating accuracy as inputs and architecture as outputs. Iterative prediction and retraining cycles refine the suggestions.

Result: The ASNN successfully suggested improved architectures that outperformed the best configurations in the original training data, for both 2-layer and 3-layer NN cases.

Conclusion: ASNN proves to be an efficient alternative to random or heuristic searches for architecture optimization, and it demonstrates promise in automating neural network design.

Abstract: The architecture of a neural network (NN) plays a critical role in
determining its performance. However, there is no general closed-form function
that maps between network structure and accuracy, making the process of
architecture design largely heuristic or search-based. In this study, we
propose the Architecture Suggesting Neural Network (ASNN), a model designed to
learn the relationship between NN architecture and its test accuracy, and to
suggest improved architectures accordingly. To train ASNN, we constructed
datasets using TensorFlow-based models with varying numbers of layers and
nodes. Experimental results were collected for both 2-layer and 3-layer
architectures across a grid of configurations, each evaluated with 10 repeated
trials to account for stochasticity. Accuracy values were treated as inputs,
and architectural parameters as outputs. The trained ASNN was then used
iteratively to predict architectures that yield higher performance. In both
2-layer and 3-layer cases, ASNN successfully suggested architectures that
outperformed the best results found in the original training data. Repeated
prediction and retraining cycles led to the discovery of architectures with
improved mean test accuracies, demonstrating the model's capacity to generalize
the performance-structure relationship. These results suggest that ASNN
provides an efficient alternative to random search for architecture
optimization, and offers a promising approach toward automating neural network
design. "Parts of the manuscript, including text editing and expression

*Cheng-Jun Guo,Chuan-Xian Ren,You-Wei Luo,Xiao-Lin Xu,Hong Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method, IS$^2$C, is proposed for partial domain adaptation (PDA), addressing label distribution shift using importance sampling, supported by theoretical guarantees and efficient computational techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial domain adaptation involves transferring knowledge between domains with unequal label distributions, where existing methods struggle with overfitting and underutilization of labeled data.

Method: IS$^2$C constructs a sampling domain with an adjusted label distribution resembling the target domain. The framework integrates importance sampling and optimal transport-based conditional alignment while reducing computational complexity.

Result: Experiments indicate IS$^2$C achieves superior performance over competing methods on PDA benchmarks, confirming theoretical claims and its effectiveness in improving generalization.

Conclusion: IS$^2$C successfully addresses PDA challenges by leveraging importance sampling and conditional distribution alignment, providing a robust and interpretable framework for knowledge transfer in uneven label distributions.

Abstract: Partial domain adaptation (PDA) is a challenging task in real-world machine
learning scenarios. It aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain
to a related unlabeled target domain, where the support set of the source label
distribution subsumes the target one. Previous PDA works managed to correct the
label distribution shift by weighting samples in the source domain. However,
the simple reweighing technique cannot explore the latent structure and
sufficiently use the labeled data, and then models are prone to over-fitting on
the source domain. In this work, we propose a novel importance sampling-based
shift correction (IS$^2$C) method, where new labeled data are sampled from a
built sampling domain, whose label distribution is supposed to be the same as
the target domain, to characterize the latent structure and enhance the
generalization ability of the model. We provide theoretical guarantees for
IS$^2$C by proving that the generalization error can be sufficiently dominated
by IS$^2$C. In particular, by implementing sampling with the mixture
distribution, the extent of shift between source and sampling domains can be
connected to generalization error, which provides an interpretable way to build
IS$^2$C. To improve knowledge transfer, an optimal transport-based independence
criterion is proposed for conditional distribution alignment, where the
computation of the criterion can be adjusted to reduce the complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ in realistic PDA scenarios. Extensive
experiments on PDA benchmarks validate the theoretical results and demonstrate
the effectiveness of our IS$^2$C over existing methods.

Abstract: This work proposes that a vast majority of classical technical indicators in

introduced as a general neural architecture that replicates and structurally
upgrades traditional indicators by supporting n-dimensional inputs such as

Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of a modularized, standardized benchmark for comparing protein geometry modeling methods using SE(3)-based generative models.

Method: The paper proposes a benchmark called Protein-SE(3), integrating diverse generative models like DDPM, Score Matching, and Flow Matching under a unified framework with consistent datasets and evaluation metrics.

Result: Protein-SE(3) investigated multiple advanced protein scaffolding generative models fairly, offering a modular platform for fast prototyping and comprehensive comparison.

Conclusion: Protein-SE(3) provides a publicly available benchmark to advance the development and evaluation of SE(3)-based protein structure design methods.

Abstract: SE(3)-based generative models have shown great promise in protein geometry
modeling and effective structure design. However, the field currently lacks a
modularized benchmark to enable comprehensive investigation and fair comparison
of different methods. In this paper, we propose Protein-SE(3), a new benchmark
based on a unified training framework, which comprises protein scaffolding
tasks, integrated generative models, high-level mathematical abstraction, and
diverse evaluation metrics. Recent advanced generative models designed for
protein scaffolding, from multiple perspectives like DDPM (Genie1 and Genie2),
Score Matching (FrameDiff and RfDiffusion) and Flow Matching (FoldFlow and
FrameFlow) are integrated into our framework. All integrated methods are fairly
investigated with the same training dataset and evaluation metrics.
Furthermore, we provide a high-level abstraction of the mathematical
foundations behind the generative models, enabling fast prototyping of future
algorithms without reliance on explicit protein structures. Accordingly, we
release the first comprehensive benchmark built upon unified training framework
for SE(3)-based protein structure design, which is publicly accessible at

### [402] [Learning from Expert Factors: Trajectory-level Reward Shaping for Formulaic Alpha Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20263)
*Junjie Zhao,Chengxi Zhang,Chenkai Wang,Peng Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Trajectory-level Reward Shaping (TLRS) to tackle sparse rewards in RL for mining profitable investment strategies, achieving improved predictive power and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning methods for mining alpha factors are hampered by sparse rewards and inefficient exploration of a vast symbolic search space.

Method: The proposed TLRS method introduces dense intermediate rewards based on subsequence-level similarity to expert formulas and includes a reward centering mechanism to stabilize training.

Result: Experiments show TLRS improves the Rank Information Coefficient of mined factors by 9.29% and reduces computational complexity from linear to constant.

Conclusion: TLRS enhances predictive power, stabilizes RL training, and significantly boosts computational efficiency in mining alpha factors.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has successfully automated the complex process of
mining formulaic alpha factors, for creating interpretable and profitable
investment strategies. However, existing methods are hampered by the sparse
rewards given the underlying Markov Decision Process. This inefficiency limits
the exploration of the vast symbolic search space and destabilizes the training
process. To address this, Trajectory-level Reward Shaping (TLRS), a novel
reward shaping method, is proposed. TLRS provides dense, intermediate rewards
by measuring the subsequence-level similarity between partially generated
expressions and a set of expert-designed formulas. Furthermore, a reward
centering mechanism is introduced to reduce training variance. Extensive
experiments on six major Chinese and U.S. stock indices show that TLRS
significantly improves the predictive power of mined factors, boosting the Rank
Information Coefficient by 9.29% over existing potential-based shaping
algorithms. Notably, TLRS achieves a major leap in computational efficiency by
reducing its time complexity with respect to the feature dimension from linear
to constant, which is a significant improvement over distance-based baselines.

### [403] [MIPS: a Multimodal Infinite Polymer Sequence Pre-training Framework for Polymer Property Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20326)
*Jiaxi Wang,Yaosen Min,Xun Zhu,Miao Li,Ji Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIPS, a pre-training framework for polymers that combines topological and spatial information to better predict polymer properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing polymer modeling approaches struggle to represent polymer properties accurately because they typically rely on monomer-level representations, which fail to capture changes occurring during polymerization.

Method: The study proposes the MIPS framework, which treats polymers as infinite sequences of monomers, incorporates generalized message passing and graph attention mechanisms, introduces a 'star linking' strategy and backbone embedding for side-chain ring structures, extracts 3D monomer descriptors for spatial information, and employs a cross-modal fusion mechanism.

Result: MIPS achieved state-of-the-art performance across eight polymer property prediction tasks, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in modeling polymer properties.

Conclusion: The MIPS framework successfully integrates topological and spatial information, addressing existing challenges in polymer modeling and achieving superior predictive performance for diverse polymer properties.

Abstract: Polymers, composed of repeating structural units called monomers, are
fundamental materials in daily life and industry. Accurate property prediction
for polymers is essential for their design, development, and application.
However, existing modeling approaches, which typically represent polymers by
the constituent monomers, struggle to capture the whole properties of polymer,
since the properties change during the polymerization process. In this study,
we propose a Multimodal Infinite Polymer Sequence (MIPS) pre-training
framework, which represents polymers as infinite sequences of monomers and
integrates both topological and spatial information for comprehensive modeling.
From the topological perspective, we generalize message passing mechanism (MPM)
and graph attention mechanism (GAM) to infinite polymer sequences. For MPM, we
demonstrate that applying MPM to infinite polymer sequences is equivalent to
applying MPM on the induced star-linking graph of monomers. For GAM, we propose
to further replace global graph attention with localized graph attention (LGA).
Moreover, we show the robustness of the "star linking" strategy through Repeat
and Shift Invariance Test (RSIT). Despite its robustness, "star linking"
strategy exhibits limitations when monomer side chains contain ring structures,
a common characteristic of polymers, as it fails the Weisfeiler-Lehman~(WL)
test. To overcome this issue, we propose backbone embedding to enhance the
capability of MPM and LGA on infinite polymer sequences. From the spatial
perspective, we extract 3D descriptors of repeating monomers to capture spatial
information. Finally, we design a cross-modal fusion mechanism to unify the
topological and spatial information. Experimental validation across eight
diverse polymer property prediction tasks reveals that MIPS achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EduAlign, a two-stage framework that enhances large language models (LLMs) to better align with education-focused principles like helpfulness, personalization, and creativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLMs lack adherence to pedagogical principles essential for effective educational applications, such as tailored responses and creativity enhancement.

Method: EduAlign involves curating an annotated dataset to train an educational reward model (HPC-RM) and fine-tuning existing LLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with educational prompts.

Result: The fine-tuned model demonstrates improved capability in educational settings, particularly in helpfulness, personalization, and creativity stimulation.

Conclusion: EduAlign offers a scalable strategy to align LLMs with pedagogical norms, making them more effective AI tutors for personalized education.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into education presents
unprecedented opportunities for scalable personalized learning. However,
standard LLMs often function as generic information providers, lacking
alignment with fundamental pedagogical principles such as helpfulness,
student-centered personalization, and creativity cultivation. To bridge this
gap, we propose EduAlign, a novel framework designed to guide LLMs toward
becoming more effective and responsible educational assistants. EduAlign
consists of two main stages. In the first stage, we curate a dataset of 8k
educational interactions and annotate them-both manually and
automatically-along three key educational dimensions: Helpfulness,
Personalization, and Creativity (HPC). These annotations are used to train
HPC-RM, a multi-dimensional reward model capable of accurately scoring LLM
outputs according to these educational principles. We further evaluate the
consistency and reliability of this reward model. In the second stage, we
leverage HPC-RM as a reward signal to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM using Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on a set of 2k diverse prompts. We then
assess the pre- and post-finetuning models on both educational and
general-domain benchmarks across the three HPC dimensions. Experimental results
demonstrate that the fine-tuned model exhibits significantly improved alignment
with pedagogical helpfulness, personalization, and creativity stimulation. This
study presents a scalable and effective approach to aligning LLMs with nuanced
and desirable educational traits, paving the way for the development of more
engaging, pedagogically aligned AI tutors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in causal discovery from observational data, particularly in handling scalability and capturing complex global structural information, which traditional methods struggle with.

Method: A graph neural network (GNN)-based probabilistic framework is proposed. It encodes node and edge attributes into a unified graph representation and learns causal structures from synthetic datasets augmented with statistical measures. Causal discovery is framed as a supervised learning task to predict entire graph structures.

Result: The proposed approach achieves superior accuracy and scalability compared to both traditional and non-GNN-based methods, as well as existing GNN-based approaches, on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: This framework significantly enhances causal structure learning and provides broad applications in decision-making and scientific discovery across diverse fields.

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is challenging, especially with
large datasets and complex relationships. Traditional methods often struggle
with scalability and capturing global structural information. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based
probabilistic framework that learns a probability distribution over the entire
space of causal graphs, unlike methods that output a single deterministic
graph. Our framework leverages a GNN that encodes both node and edge attributes
into a unified graph representation, enabling the model to learn complex causal
structures directly from data. The GNN model is trained on a diverse set of
synthetic datasets augmented with statistical and information-theoretic
measures, such as mutual information and conditional entropy, capturing both
local and global data properties. We frame causal discovery as a supervised
learning problem, directly predicting the entire graph structure. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance, outperforming both traditional and recent
non-GNN-based methods, as well as a GNN-based approach, in terms of accuracy
and scalability on synthetic and real-world datasets without further training.
This probabilistic framework significantly improves causal structure learning,
with broad implications for decision-making and scientific discovery across
various fields.

*Kohei Miyaguchi,Masao Joko,Rebekah Sheraw,Tsuyoshi Idé*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Partial Trajectory Regression (PTR), a framework using representation learning for analyzing wafer defect causes in complex semiconductor processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to pinpoint upstream processes causing wafer defects amidst complex process flows, rework operations, and variability in waiting times.

Method: A novel framework using representation learning methods proc2vec and route2vec, combined with counterfactual reasoning based on partial trajectories.

Result: The framework was successfully validated using real wafer history data from a semiconductor fab.

Conclusion: PTR is effective in addressing the challenges of root cause analysis for wafer defects in semiconductor manufacturing.

Abstract: Identifying upstream processes responsible for wafer defects is challenging
due to the combinatorial nature of process flows and the inherent variability
in processing routes, which arises from factors such as rework operations and
random process waiting times. This paper presents a novel framework for wafer
defect root cause analysis, called Partial Trajectory Regression (PTR). The
proposed framework is carefully designed to address the limitations of
conventional vector-based regression models, particularly in handling
variable-length processing routes that span a large number of heterogeneous
physical processes. To compute the attribution score of each process given a
detected high defect density on a specific wafer, we propose a new algorithm
that compares two counterfactual outcomes derived from partial process
trajectories. This is enabled by new representation learning methods, proc2vec
and route2vec. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework using
real wafer history data from the NY CREATES fab in Albany.

### [408] [MH-GIN: Multi-scale Heterogeneous Graph-based Imputation Network for AIS Data (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20362)
*Hengyu Liu,Tianyi Li,Yuqiang He,Kristian Torp,Yushuai Li,Christian S. Jensen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MH-GIN, a graph-based network for imputing missing maritime data, achieving significant error reduction compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing imputation methods often fail to accurately impute missing data in Automatic Identification System datasets due to multi-scale dependencies among heterogeneous attributes.

Method: MH-GIN extracts multi-scale temporal features and constructs a heterogeneous graph to model dependencies between attributes, ensuring accurate imputation of missing data.

Result: MH-GIN achieves an average of 57% reduction in imputation errors compared to state-of-the-art methods on two real-world datasets.

Conclusion: MH-GIN effectively addresses the challenge of missing values in maritime tracking data, demonstrating improved imputation accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Location-tracking data from the Automatic Identification System, much of
which is publicly available, plays a key role in a range of maritime safety and
monitoring applications. However, the data suffers from missing values that
hamper downstream applications. Imputing the missing values is challenging
because the values of different heterogeneous attributes are updated at diverse
rates, resulting in the occurrence of multi-scale dependencies among
attributes. Existing imputation methods that assume similar update rates across
attributes are unable to capture and exploit such dependencies, limiting their
imputation accuracy. We propose MH-GIN, a Multi-scale Heterogeneous Graph-based
Imputation Network that aims improve imputation accuracy by capturing
multi-scale dependencies. Specifically, MH-GIN first extracts multi-scale
temporal features for each attribute while preserving their intrinsic
heterogeneous characteristics. Then, it constructs a multi-scale heterogeneous
graph to explicitly model dependencies between heterogeneous attributes to
enable more accurate imputation of missing values through graph propagation.
Experimental results on two real-world datasets find that MH-GIN is capable of
an average 57% reduction in imputation errors compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while maintaining computational efficiency. The source code and
implementation details of MH-GIN are publicly available

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Trajectory Shapley Attribution (TSA), an advanced attribution method to pinpoint upstream issues in semiconductor manufacturing when defects occur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the difficulty in conducting cross-process root cause analysis for wafer defects due to the complexity and multitude of steps in semiconductor manufacturing.

Method: The authors propose TSA, an enhancement to Shapley values, designed to factor in the sequential progress and avoid arbitrary reference point selection during analysis.

Result: TSA was successfully applied to experimental data from front-end-of-line processes to identify measurement items associated with defect anomalies.

Conclusion: TSA improves the diagnostic analysis by addressing existing Shapley value limitations, helping manufacturers in pinpointing defect causes efficiently.

Abstract: How can we identify problematic upstream processes when a certain type of
wafer defect starts appearing at a quality checkpoint? Given the complexity of
modern semiconductor manufacturing, which involves thousands of process steps,
cross-process root cause analysis for wafer defects has been considered highly
challenging. This paper proposes a novel framework called Trajectory Shapley
Attribution (TSA), an extension of Shapley values (SV), a widely used
attribution algorithm in explainable artificial intelligence research. TSA
overcomes key limitations of standard SV, including its disregard for the
sequential nature of manufacturing processes and its reliance on an arbitrarily
chosen reference point. We applied TSA to a good-bad wafer diagnosis task in
experimental front-end-of-line processes at the NY CREATES Albany NanoTech fab,
aiming to identify measurement items (serving as proxies for process
parameters) most relevant to abnormal defect occurrence.

*Ahmed Shokry,Ayman Khalafallah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a meta-learning-based clustering algorithm using a pre-trained network, achieving superior accuracy and scalability without needing parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clustering is challenging due to its unsupervised nature and limitations such as parameter tuning, complexity, and suboptimal accuracy in large datasets.

Method: The method employs a Prior-Data Fitted Transformer Network (PFN) that computes attention between pre-clustered and unclustered samples to infer cluster assignments.

Result: Experiments show the method excels in clustering, requires no pre-clustered samples for well-separated data, and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques with even minimal pre-clustered input.

Conclusion: The approach is effective, scalable, and offers a promising alternative to traditional clustering techniques.

Abstract: Clustering is a core task in machine learning with wide-ranging applications
in data mining and pattern recognition. However, its unsupervised nature makes
it inherently challenging. Many existing clustering algorithms suffer from
critical limitations: they often require careful parameter tuning, exhibit high
computational complexity, lack interpretability, or yield suboptimal accuracy,
especially when applied to large-scale datasets. In this paper, we introduce a
novel clustering approach based on meta-learning. Our approach eliminates the
need for parameter optimization while achieving accuracy that outperforms
state-of-the-art clustering techniques. The proposed technique leverages a few
pre-clustered samples to guide the clustering process for the entire dataset in
a single forward pass. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained Prior-Data Fitted
Transformer Network (PFN) to perform clustering. The algorithm computes
attention between the pre-clustered samples and the unclustered samples,
allowing it to infer cluster assignments for the entire dataset based on the
learned relation. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that, given just
a few pre-clustered examples, the model can generalize to accurately cluster
the rest of the dataset. Experiments on challenging benchmark datasets show
that our approach can successfully cluster well-separated data without any
pre-clustered samples, and significantly improves performance when a few
clustered samples are provided. We show that our approach is superior to the
state-of-the-art techniques. These results highlight the effectiveness and
scalability of our approach, positioning it as a promising alternative to
existing clustering techniques.

Result: WBHT demonstrates significant improvement on real-world network data, achieving enhanced F1 scores (ranging from 1.65% to 58.76%) compared to existing models.

Conclusion: WBHT proves to be an efficient tool for proactive network monitoring and security, especially in mission-critical networks, due to its ability to detect previously unnoticed anomalies.

Abstract: We propose the Wasserstein Black Hole Transformer (WBHT) framework for
detecting black hole (BH) anomalies in communication networks. These anomalies
cause packet loss without failure notifications, disrupting connectivity and
leading to financial losses. WBHT combines generative modeling, sequential
learning, and attention mechanisms to improve BH anomaly detection. It
integrates a Wasserstein generative adversarial network with attention
mechanisms for stable training and accurate anomaly identification. The model
uses long-short-term memory layers to capture long-term dependencies and
convolutional layers for local temporal patterns. A latent space encoding
mechanism helps distinguish abnormal network behavior. Tested on real-world
network data, WBHT outperforms existing models, achieving significant
improvements in F1 score (ranging from 1.65% to 58.76%). Its efficiency and
ability to detect previously undetected anomalies make it a valuable tool for

TL;DR: The paper introduces ResCap-DBP, a deep learning framework for improved DNA-binding protein (DBP) prediction using advanced architectures combining residual learning and Capsule Networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in experimental DBP identification methods by introducing computational techniques that can deliver accurate predictions quickly and cost-effectively.

Method: The proposed method involves combining residual learning-based encoders with 1D Capsule Networks (1D-CapsNet), alongside the use of ProteinBERT embeddings and dilated convolutions for feature extraction.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with high accuracy, reflected by AUC scores of 98.0% and 89.5% on key benchmarks (PDB14189 and PDB1075, respectively). It also delivers balanced sensitivity and specificity across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The study concludes that integrating global protein representations with innovative deep learning architectures like ResCap-DBP offers an effective and generalizable solution for scalable DBP prediction across genomic contexts.

Abstract: DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) are integral to gene regulation and cellular
processes, making their accurate identification essential for understanding
biological functions and disease mechanisms. Experimental methods for DBP
identification are time-consuming and costly, driving the need for efficient
computational prediction techniques. In this study, we propose a novel deep
learning framework, ResCap-DBP, that combines a residual learning-based encoder
with a one-dimensional Capsule Network (1D-CapsNet) to predict DBPs directly
from raw protein sequences. Our architecture incorporates dilated convolutions
within residual blocks to mitigate vanishing gradient issues and extract rich
sequence features, while capsule layers with dynamic routing capture
hierarchical and spatial relationships within the learned feature space. We
conducted comprehensive ablation studies comparing global and local embeddings
from ProteinBERT and conventional one-hot encoding. Results show that
ProteinBERT embeddings substantially outperform other representations on large
datasets. Although one-hot encoding showed marginal advantages on smaller
datasets, such as PDB186, it struggled to scale effectively. Extensive
evaluations on four pairs of publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our model consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. It
achieved AUC scores of 98.0% and 89.5% on PDB14189andPDB1075, respectively. On
independent test sets PDB2272 and PDB186, the model attained top AUCs of 83.2%
and 83.3%, while maintaining competitive performance on larger datasets such as
PDB20000. Notably, the model maintains a well balanced sensitivity and
specificity across datasets. These results demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of integrating global protein representations with advanced
deep learning architectures for reliable and scalable DBP prediction in diverse
genomic contexts.

Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in transfer learning such as negative transfer, domain adaptation, and inefficiency in policy selection, especially in dynamic domains like game development.

Method: FAST utilizes latent task representations derived from visual frames and textual descriptions to estimate task similarity. It uses these similarity scores to select suitable source policies for knowledge transfer.

Result: Experimental results in racing tracks show that FAST achieves competitive performances compared to scratch learning, with significantly reduced training steps.

Conclusion: FAST demonstrates the effectiveness of task similarity estimations based on embedding to improve learning efficiency and transferability, highlighting its potential in dynamic task scenarios.

Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) offers the potential to accelerate learning by
transferring knowledge across tasks. However, it faces critical challenges such
as negative transfer, domain adaptation and inefficiency in selecting solid
source policies. These issues often represent critical problems in evolving
domains, i.e. game development, where scenarios transform and agents must
adapt. The continuous release of new agents is costly and inefficient. In this
work we challenge the key issues in TL to improve knowledge transfer, agents
performance across tasks and reduce computational costs. The proposed
methodology, called FAST - Framework for Adaptive Similarity-based Transfer,
leverages visual frames and textual descriptions to create a latent
representation of tasks dynamics, that is exploited to estimate similarity
between environments. The similarity scores guides our method in choosing
candidate policies from which transfer abilities to simplify learning of novel
tasks. Experimental results, over multiple racing tracks, demonstrate that FAST
achieves competitive final performance compared to learning-from-scratch
methods while requiring significantly less training steps. These findings
highlight the potential of embedding-driven task similarity estimations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how transformers develop in-context learning (ICL) abilities for nonlinear regression tasks, analyzing the dynamics of attention weights and their convergence. It identifies the Lipschitz constant as a key factor and provides convergence time guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance theoretical understanding of how transformers acquire in-context learning capabilities, especially in complex tasks like nonlinear regression, beyond existing research on simpler tasks.

Method: The paper analyzes stage-wise dynamics of attention scores during the training process of transformers and introduces proof techniques to explore the impact of nonlinear task functions' properties.

Result: Attention weights exhibit distinct dynamics: rapid growth in relevant feature scores and slower decay or oscillations in irrelevant feature scores. The Lipschitz constant governs convergence behaviors with bounded time guarantees for near-zero prediction error.

Conclusion: Transformers reliably leverage prompt tokens with relevant features for unseen functions at convergence, revealing their effectiveness in nonlinear ICL tasks.

Abstract: The transformer architecture, which processes sequences of input tokens to
produce outputs for query tokens, has revolutionized numerous areas of machine
learning. A defining feature of transformers is their ability to perform
previously unseen tasks using task-specific prompts without updating
parameters, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent research
has actively explored the training dynamics behind ICL, with much of the focus
on relatively simple tasks such as linear regression and binary classification.
To advance the theoretical understanding of ICL, this paper investigates more
complex nonlinear regression tasks, aiming to uncover how transformers acquire
in-context learning capabilities in these settings. We analyze the stage-wise
dynamics of attention during training: attention scores between a query token
and its target features grow rapidly in the early phase, then gradually
converge to one, while attention to irrelevant features decays more slowly and
exhibits oscillatory behavior. Our analysis introduces new proof techniques
that explicitly characterize how the nature of general non-degenerate
L-Lipschitz task functions affects attention weights. Specifically, we identify
that the Lipschitz constant L of nonlinear function classes as a key factor
governing the convergence dynamics of transformers in ICL. Leveraging these
insights, for two distinct regimes depending on whether L is below or above a
threshold, we derive different time bounds to guarantee near-zero prediction
error. Notably, despite the convergence time depending on the underlying task
functions, we prove that query tokens consistently attend to prompt tokens with
highly relevant features at convergence, demonstrating the ICL capability of
transformers for unseen functions.

*Guanghui Zhu,Xin Fang,Lei Wang,Wenzhong Chen,Rong Gu,Chunfeng Yuan,Yihua Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces BOASF, a combined Bayesian Optimization and Adaptive Successive Filtering method to automate model selection and hyperparameter tuning efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges faced by non-experts in effectively solving machine learning tasks, particularly in model selection and hyperparameter optimization.

Method: Proposes BOASF, which combines Bayesian optimization and Adaptive Successive Filtering under a multi-armed bandit framework. It incorporates Gaussian UCB-based probabilistic model and Softmax-based resource allocation.

Result: BOASF demonstrates faster optimization, robust model selection, better prediction performance, and improved anytime performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: BOASF effectively streamlines and improves the process of model selection and hyperparameter optimization, making machine learning tasks more accessible to non-experts.

Abstract: Machine learning has been making great success in many application areas.
However, for the non-expert practitioners, it is always very challenging to
address a machine learning task successfully and efficiently. Finding the
optimal machine learning model or the hyperparameter combination set from a
large number of possible alternatives usually requires considerable expert
knowledge and experience. To tackle this problem, we propose a combined
Bayesian Optimization and Adaptive Successive Filtering algorithm (BOASF) under
a unified multi-armed bandit framework to automate the model selection or the
hyperparameter optimization. Specifically, BOASF consists of multiple
evaluation rounds in each of which we select promising configurations for each
arm using the Bayesian optimization. Then, ASF can early discard the
poor-performed arms adaptively using a Gaussian UCB-based probabilistic model.
Furthermore, a Softmax model is employed to adaptively allocate available
resources for each promising arm that advances to the next round. The arm with
a higher probability of advancing will be allocated more resources.
Experimental results show that BOASF is effective for speeding up the model
selection and hyperparameter optimization processes while achieving robust and
better prediction performance than the existing state-of-the-art automatic
machine learning methods. Moreover, BOASF achieves better anytime performance
under various time budgets.

*Takanobu Furuhashi,Hidekata Hontani,Tatsuya Yokota*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes WEEP, a novel sparse regularizer that is differentiable and L-smooth, resolving conflicts between sparsity and optimization constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental conflict between strongest sparsity-inducing penalties being non-differentiable, causing issues with dominant gradient-based optimizers.

Method: Developing WEEP, a differentiable and L-smooth sparse regularizer derived from the weakly-convex envelope framework, ensuring compatibility with gradient-based methods.

Result: WEEP achieves superior performance compared to L1-norm and non-convex sparse regularizers in signal and image denoising tasks.

Conclusion: WEEP successfully combines sparse regularization efficiency with optimization tractability, marking a significant advancement in signal processing.

Abstract: Sparse regularization is fundamental in signal processing for efficient
signal recovery and feature extraction. However, it faces a fundamental
dilemma: the most powerful sparsity-inducing penalties are often
non-differentiable, conflicting with gradient-based optimizers that dominate
the field. We introduce WEEP (Weakly-convex Envelope of Piecewise Penalty), a
novel, fully differentiable sparse regularizer derived from the weakly-convex
envelope framework. WEEP provides strong, unbiased sparsity while maintaining
full differentiability and L-smoothness, making it natively compatible with any
gradient-based optimizer. This resolves the conflict between statistical
performance and computational tractability. We demonstrate superior performance
compared to the L1-norm and other established non-convex sparse regularizers on
challenging signal and image denoising tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address a gap in research on the robustness of different self-attention mechanisms to noise and spurious correlations in data.

Method: The authors compare five self-attention variants (Softmax, Sigmoid, Linear, Doubly Stochastic, and Cosine) under data corruption scenarios using three datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Imagenette.

Result: Doubly Stochastic attention demonstrated the highest robustness to data corruption scenarios across the tested datasets.

Conclusion: Doubly Stochastic attention is a suitable choice for applications involving imperfect or noisy data in Vision Transformers.

Abstract: Self-attention mechanisms are foundational to Transformer architectures,

many self-attention variants, their robustness to noise and spurious
correlations has not been well studied. This study evaluates Softmax, Sigmoid,
Linear, Doubly Stochastic, and Cosine attention within Vision Transformers
under different data corruption scenarios. Through testing across the CIFAR-10,

the most robust. Our findings inform self-attention selection in contexts with
imperfect data.

### [420] [Shapley-Value-Based Graph Sparsification for GNN Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20460)
*Selahattin Akkas,Ariful Azad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores using Shapley value-based methods for graph sparsification in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which retain influential edges while removing unimportant ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve inference efficiency and interpretability in Graph Neural Networks by sparsifying graphs while preserving predictive performance.

Method: The methodology relies on Shapley value-based techniques to score edge importance, considering both positive and negative contributions, unlike traditional non-negative explainers.

Result: The results demonstrate that Shapley value-based graph sparsification significantly reduces graph complexity while maintaining predictive performance.

Conclusion: Using Shapley value provides a robust and fair method for graph sparsification, enhancing efficiency and interpretability in GNN inference.

Abstract: Graph sparsification is a key technique for improving inference efficiency in
Graph Neural Networks by removing edges with minimal impact on predictions. GNN
explainability methods generate local importance scores, which can be
aggregated into global scores for graph sparsification. However, many
explainability methods produce only non-negative scores, limiting their
applicability for sparsification. In contrast, Shapley value based methods
assign both positive and negative contributions to node predictions, offering a
theoretically robust and fair allocation of importance by evaluating many
subsets of graphs. Unlike gradient-based or perturbation-based explainers,
Shapley values enable better pruning strategies that preserve influential edges
while removing misleading or adversarial connections. Our approach shows that
Shapley value-based graph sparsification maintains predictive performance while
significantly reducing graph complexity, enhancing both interpretability and
efficiency in GNN inference.

### [421] [Conditional Diffusion Models for Global Precipitation Map Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20478)
*Daiko Kishikawa,Yuka Muto,Shunji Kotsuki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study addresses incomplete satellite-based precipitation data by treating map reconstruction as a video inpainting task, leveraging conditional diffusion models for better consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete precipitation data due to satellite limitations hampers effective global monitoring. Current interpolation methods fail to produce spatial continuity in precipitation maps.

Method: The researchers developed a machine learning model using conditional diffusion techniques with a 3D U-Net architecture, trained on ERA5 precipitation datasets, and applied GSMaP masks to simulate real-world gaps.

Result: The proposed method achieved improved spatio-temporal consistency in inpainting precipitation maps compared to conventional techniques, as evidenced by performance evaluations conducted for 2024.

Conclusion: Conditional diffusion models can enhance satellite-based precipitation monitoring by effectively addressing missing regions in data and improving its continuity.

Abstract: Incomplete satellite-based precipitation presents a significant challenge in
global monitoring. For example, the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation
(GSMaP) from JAXA suffers from substantial missing regions due to the orbital
characteristics of satellites that have microwave sensors, and its current
interpolation methods often result in spatial discontinuities. In this study,
we formulate the completion of the precipitation map as a video inpainting task
and propose a machine learning approach based on conditional diffusion models.
Our method employs a 3D U-Net with a 3D condition encoder to reconstruct
complete precipitation maps by leveraging spatio-temporal information from
infrared images, latitude-longitude grids, and physical time inputs. Training
was carried out on ERA5 hourly precipitation data from 2020 to 2023. We
generated a pseudo-GSMaP dataset by randomly applying GSMaP masks to ERA maps.
Performance was evaluated for the calendar year 2024, and our approach produces
more spatio-temporally consistent inpainted precipitation maps compared to
conventional methods. These results indicate the potential to improve global
precipitation monitoring using the conditional diffusion models.

### [422] [HIAL: A New Paradigm for Hypergraph Active Learning via Influence Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20490)
*Yanheng Hou,Xunkai Li,Zhenjun Li,Bing Zhou,Ronghua Li,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HIAL, a new Active Learning framework tailored for hypergraphs, outperforming existing methods by maintaining high-order structural information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active Learning for hypergraphs faces challenges with existing methods as they fail to retain high-order structural information, resulting in suboptimal performance.

Method: The authors propose HIAL, formulating Hypergraph Active Learning as an Influence Maximization problem with a dual-perspective influence function leveraging HOI-Aware propagation mechanism.

Result: HIAL achieves superior performance, efficiency, generality, and robustness compared to state-of-the-art baselines across seven public datasets.

Conclusion: The work establishes HIAL as an efficient and effective approach for Active Learning on hypergraphs, preserving the high-order structural properties essential for their success.

Abstract: In recent years, Hypergraph Neural Networks (HNNs) have demonstrated immense
potential in handling complex systems with high-order interactions. However,
acquiring large-scale, high-quality labeled data for these models is costly,
making Active Learning (AL) a critical technique. Existing Graph Active
Learning (GAL) methods, when applied to hypergraphs, often rely on techniques
like "clique expansion," which destroys the high-order structural information
crucial to a hypergraph's success, thereby leading to suboptimal performance.
To address this challenge, we introduce HIAL (Hypergraph Active Learning), a
native active learning framework designed specifically for hypergraphs. We
innovatively reformulate the Hypergraph Active Learning (HAL) problem as an
Influence Maximization task. The core of HIAL is a dual-perspective influence
function that, based on our novel "High-Order Interaction-Aware (HOI-Aware)"
propagation mechanism, synergistically evaluates a node's feature-space
coverage (via Magnitude of Influence, MoI) and its topological influence (via
Expected Diffusion Value, EDV). We prove that this objective function is
monotone and submodular, thus enabling the use of an efficient greedy algorithm
with a formal (1-1/e) approximation guarantee. Extensive experiments on seven
public datasets demonstrate that HIAL significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in terms of performance, efficiency, generality, and
robustness, establishing an efficient and powerful new paradigm for active
learning on hypergraphs.

### [423] [Mixture of Length and Pruning Experts for Knowledge Graphs Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20498)
*Enjun Du,Siyi Liu,Yongqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MoKGR, a framework to enhance KG reasoning by personalizing path exploration for better contextual relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph neural networks struggle with rigid, query-agnostic path exploration, limiting adaptability to diverse contexts and nuances.

Method: MoKGR utilizes a mixture-of-experts framework, featuring (1) length experts for adaptive path depth and (2) pruning experts for retaining informative paths.

Result: Experiments on diverse benchmarks show MoKGR outperforms existing methods in both transductive and inductive KG reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Personalized path exploration significantly improves KG reasoning, with MoKGR showcasing superior adaptability and performance across settings.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning, which aims to infer new facts from structured
knowledge repositories, plays a vital role in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
systems. Its effectiveness critically depends on constructing informative and
contextually relevant reasoning paths. However, existing graph neural networks
(GNNs) often adopt rigid, query-agnostic path-exploration strategies, limiting
their ability to adapt to diverse linguistic contexts and semantic nuances. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{MoKGR}, a mixture-of-experts
framework that personalizes path exploration through two complementary
components: (1) a mixture of length experts that adaptively selects and weights
candidate path lengths according to query complexity, providing query-specific
reasoning depth; and (2) a mixture of pruning experts that evaluates candidate
paths from a complementary perspective, retaining the most informative paths
for each query. Through comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmark, MoKGR
demonstrates superior performance in both transductive and inductive settings,
validating the effectiveness of personalized path exploration in KGs reasoning.

### [424] [DmC: Nearest Neighbor Guidance Diffusion Model for Offline Cross-domain Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20499)
*Linh Le Pham Van,Minh Hoang Nguyen,Duc Kieu,Hung Le,Hung The Tran,Sunil Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in cross-domain offline reinforcement learning under limited target data by introducing DmC, a $k$-nearest-neighbor-based framework that mitigates overfitting and generates aligned source samples for improved policy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for leveraging source datasets in cross-domain offline RL often struggle with large source and small target datasets, resulting in overfitting, and fail to account for partial domain overlaps.

Method: DmC leverages $k$-nearest neighbor estimation to assess domain proximity and employs a nearest-neighbor-guided diffusion model to generate source samples better aligned with the target domain.

Result: The proposed framework significantly enhances performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in diverse reinforcement learning environments, as validated through theoretical analysis and experiments.

Conclusion: DmC offers a robust solution for cross-domain offline RL with limited target data by reducing overfitting and better aligning source data to the target domain for more effective policy learning.

Abstract: Cross-domain offline reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to enhance sample
efficiency in offline RL by utilizing additional offline source datasets. A key
challenge is to identify and utilize source samples that are most relevant to
the target domain. Existing approaches address this challenge by measuring
domain gaps through domain classifiers, target transition dynamics modeling, or
mutual information estimation using contrastive loss. However, these methods
often require large target datasets, which is impractical in many real-world
scenarios. In this work, we address cross-domain offline RL under a limited
target data setting, identifying two primary challenges: (1) Dataset imbalance,
which is caused by large source and small target datasets and leads to
overfitting in neural network-based domain gap estimators, resulting in
uninformative measurements; and (2) Partial domain overlap, where only a subset
of the source data is closely aligned with the target domain. To overcome these
issues, we propose DmC, a novel framework for cross-domain offline RL with
limited target samples. Specifically, DmC utilizes $k$-nearest neighbor
($k$-NN) based estimation to measure domain proximity without neural network
training, effectively mitigating overfitting. Then, by utilizing this domain
proximity, we introduce a nearest-neighbor-guided diffusion model to generate
additional source samples that are better aligned with the target domain, thus
enhancing policy learning with more effective source samples. Through
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments in diverse MuJoCo environments,
we demonstrate that DmC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain
offline RL methods, achieving substantial performance gains.

### [425] [Customize Multi-modal RAI Guardrails with Precedent-based predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20503)
*Cheng-Fu Yang,Thanh Tran,Christos Christodoulopoulos,Weitong Ruan,Rahul Gupta,Kai-Wei Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method to create adaptable content filtering mechanisms (guardrails) using precedents, outperforming existing methods in flexibility and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current content filtering systems face challenges such as limited policy adaptability, dependence on extensive retraining, and inability to accommodate custom user-defined policies with limited data.

Method: The authors introduce a novel approach leveraging "precedents"—reasoning processes from similar prior data points instead of fixed policies. They designed a critique-revise mechanism to collect high-quality precedents and apply robust prediction strategies.

Result: Experimental results show the method surpasses existing techniques in both few-shot learning and full-dataset scenarios, with improved generalization to new policies.

Conclusion: By conditioning models on precedents rather than fixed policies, this method enhances scalability, adaptability, and generalizability, addressing key limitations in existing guardrail systems.

Abstract: A multi-modal guardrail must effectively filter image content based on
user-defined policies, identifying material that may be hateful, reinforce
harmful stereotypes, contain explicit material, or spread misinformation.
Deploying such guardrails in real-world applications, however, poses
significant challenges. Users often require varied and highly customizable
policies and typically cannot provide abundant examples for each custom policy.
Consequently, an ideal guardrail should be scalable to the multiple policies
and adaptable to evolving user standards with minimal retraining. Existing
fine-tuning methods typically condition predictions on pre-defined policies,
restricting their generalizability to new policies or necessitating extensive
retraining to adapt. Conversely, training-free methods struggle with limited
context lengths, making it difficult to incorporate all the policies
comprehensively. To overcome these limitations, we propose to condition model's
judgment on "precedents", which are the reasoning processes of prior data
points similar to the given input. By leveraging precedents instead of fixed
policies, our approach greatly enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the
guardrail. In this paper, we introduce a critique-revise mechanism for
collecting high-quality precedents and two strategies that utilize precedents
for robust prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms previous methods across both few-shot and full-dataset scenarios
and exhibits superior generalization to novel policies.

TL;DR: The MPCCL model combines multi-scale graph coarsening and contrastive learning to address limitations in attributed graph clustering methods, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address critical issues in attributed graph clustering such as long-range dependency, feature collapse, and information loss.

Method: Introduce a multi-scale coarsening strategy for graph clustering, use one-to-many contrastive learning, and integrate graph reconstruction loss and KL divergence in a self-supervised framework.

Result: MPCCL achieves substantial improvements in clustering performance, with a 15.24% increase in NMI on the ACM dataset and robust gains on smaller datasets.

Conclusion: MPCCL overcomes major limitations in existing graph clustering methods by enhancing high-order feature representation, structural preservation, and feature diversity.

Abstract: This study introduces the Multi-Scale Weight-Based Pairwise Coarsening and
Contrastive Learning (MPCCL) model, a novel approach for attributed graph
clustering that effectively bridges critical gaps in existing methods,
including long-range dependency, feature collapse, and information loss.
Traditional methods often struggle to capture high-order graph features due to
their reliance on low-order attribute information, while contrastive learning
techniques face limitations in feature diversity by overemphasizing local
neighborhood structures. Similarly, conventional graph coarsening methods,
though reducing graph scale, frequently lose fine-grained structural details.
MPCCL addresses these challenges through an innovative multi-scale coarsening
strategy, which progressively condenses the graph while prioritizing the
merging of key edges based on global node similarity to preserve essential
structural information. It further introduces a one-to-many contrastive
learning paradigm, integrating node embeddings with augmented graph views and
cluster centroids to enhance feature diversity, while mitigating feature
masking issues caused by the accumulation of high-frequency node weights during
multi-scale coarsening. By incorporating a graph reconstruction loss and KL
divergence into its self-supervised learning framework, MPCCL ensures
cross-scale consistency of node representations. Experimental evaluations
reveal that MPCCL achieves a significant improvement in clustering performance,
including a remarkable 15.24% increase in NMI on the ACM dataset and notable
robust gains on smaller-scale datasets such as Citeseer, Cora and DBLP.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ray tracing for optical systems is computationally intensive due to sequential surface computations. The motivation is to develop a more efficient method for accurate optical modeling.

Method: The proposed method, Ray2Ray, uses implicit neural representations to map input rays to output rays in a single, end-to-end model, circumventing traditional ray tracing processes.

Result: Ray2Ray was trained on nine optical systems and achieved high accuracy, with positional errors around 1 μm and angular deviations of approximately 0.01 degrees.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that neural representations can serve as an effective proxy for optical ray tracing, improving efficiency without sacrificing physical accuracy.

Abstract: Ray tracing is a widely used technique for modeling optical systems,
involving sequential surface-by-surface computations, which can be
computationally intensive. We propose Ray2Ray, a novel method that leverages
implicit neural representations to model optical systems with greater
efficiency, eliminating the need for surface-by-surface computations in a
single pass end-to-end model. Ray2Ray learns the mapping between rays emitted
from a given source and their corresponding rays after passing through a given
optical system in a physically accurate manner. We train Ray2Ray on nine
off-the-shelf optical systems, achieving positional errors on the order of
1{\mu}m and angular deviations on the order 0.01 degrees in the estimated
output rays. Our work highlights the potential of neural representations as a
proxy for optical raytracer.

TL;DR: KOBO is a novel black-box optimization method that uses kernel learning in a latent space to outperform previous methods with fewer samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimize unknown functions in high-dimensional spaces with a limited sample budget, especially for practical applications like hearing aids or generative models.

Method: Leverage Gaussian Process kernel learning within a latent space generated by a variational autoencoder, paired with auxiliary optimization.

Result: KOBO delivers superior results compared to state-of-the-art approaches, using significantly fewer samples on synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications.

Conclusion: The approach effectively reduces sample budgets in black-box optimization tasks, demonstrating broad applicability across synthetic and practical cases.

Abstract: Black box optimization (BBO) focuses on optimizing unknown functions in
high-dimensional spaces. In many applications, sampling the unknown function is
expensive, imposing a tight sample budget. Ongoing work is making progress on
reducing the sample budget by learning the shape/structure of the function,
known as kernel learning. We propose a new method to learn the kernel of a
Gaussian Process. Our idea is to create a continuous kernel space in the latent
space of a variational autoencoder, and run an auxiliary optimization to
identify the best kernel. Results show that the proposed method, Kernel
Optimized Blackbox Optimization (KOBO), outperforms state of the art by
estimating the optimal at considerably lower sample budgets. Results hold not
only across synthetic benchmark functions but also in real applications. We
show that a hearing aid may be personalized with fewer audio queries to the
user, or a generative model could converge to desirable images from limited
user ratings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blockchain-based FL solutions face inefficiencies in resource-constrained environments, particularly due to traditional Proof of Work mechanisms and challenges like data heterogeneity and asynchronous client participation.

Method: The proposed DAG-AFL framework introduces a directed acyclic graph for consensus and a tip selection algorithm that factors in model accuracy, node reachability, and temporal freshness, along with a trusted verification solution.

Conclusion: DAG-AFL addresses key challenges of blockchain-based FL by improving scalability, efficiency, and accuracy, making it a promising solution for asynchronous and resource-limited federated settings.

Abstract: Due to the distributed nature of federated learning (FL), the vulnerability
of the global model and the need for coordination among many client devices
pose significant challenges. As a promising decentralized, scalable and secure
solution, blockchain-based FL methods have attracted widespread attention in
recent years. However, traditional consensus mechanisms designed for Proof of
Work (PoW) similar to blockchain incur substantial resource consumption and
compromise the efficiency of FL, particularly when participating devices are
wireless and resource-limited. To address asynchronous client participation and
data heterogeneity in FL, while limiting the additional resource overhead
introduced by blockchain, we propose the Directed Acyclic Graph-based
Asynchronous Federated Learning (DAG-AFL) framework. We develop a tip selection
algorithm that considers temporal freshness, node reachability and model
accuracy, with a DAG-based trusted verification strategy. Extensive experiments
on 3 benchmarking datasets against eight state-of-the-art approaches
demonstrate that DAG-AFL significantly improves training efficiency and model
accuracy by 22.7% and 6.5% on average, respectively.

### [431] [Reminiscence Attack on Residuals: Exploiting Approximate Machine Unlearning for Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20573)
*Yaxin Xiao,Qingqing Ye,Li Hu,Huadi Zheng,Haibo Hu,Zi Liang,Haoyang Li,Yijie Jiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper highlights the vulnerability of approximate machine unlearning algorithms to privacy attacks due to residual data traces. It introduces the "Reminiscence Attack" (ReA) and proposes a dual-phase unlearning framework to mitigate this risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust machine unlearning techniques to ensure data privacy and comply with the 'right to be forgotten,' while avoiding vulnerabilities linked to residual data traces.

Method: Developed "Reminiscence Attack" (ReA) to expose vulnerabilities in approximate unlearning, and a dual-phase unlearning framework to eliminate residual privacy risks through deep-layer data trace removal and convergence stabilization.

Result: ReA outperformed prior attacks in inferring membership, while the proposed framework reduced privacy attack accuracy to random guessing levels with minimal computational overhead compared to full model retraining.

Conclusion: The dual-phase framework provides a more effective approach to mitigating privacy risks in machine unlearning, balancing unlearning efficacy and computational costs.

Abstract: Machine unlearning enables the removal of specific data from ML models to
uphold the right to be forgotten. While approximate unlearning algorithms offer
efficient alternatives to full retraining, this work reveals that they fail to
adequately protect the privacy of unlearned data. In particular, these
algorithms introduce implicit residuals which facilitate privacy attacks
targeting at unlearned data. We observe that these residuals persist regardless
of model architectures, parameters, and unlearning algorithms, exposing a new
attack surface beyond conventional output-based leakage. Based on this insight,
we propose the Reminiscence Attack (ReA), which amplifies the correlation
between residuals and membership privacy through targeted fine-tuning
processes. ReA achieves up to 1.90x and 1.12x higher accuracy than prior
attacks when inferring class-wise and sample-wise membership, respectively. To
mitigate such residual-induced privacy risk, we develop a dual-phase
approximate unlearning framework that first eliminates deep-layer unlearned
data traces and then enforces convergence stability to prevent models from
"pseudo-convergence", where their outputs are similar to retrained models but
still preserve unlearned residuals. Our framework works for both classification
and generation tasks. Experimental evaluations confirm that our approach
maintains high unlearning efficacy, while reducing the adaptive privacy attack
accuracy to nearly random guess, at the computational cost of 2-12% of full
retraining from scratch.

### [432] [Dissecting Persona-Driven Reasoning in Language Models via Activation Patching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20936)
*Ansh Poonia,Maeghal Jain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates how assigning personas to large language models (LLMs) affects reasoning tasks, using activation patching to understand encoding patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comprehend how personas assigned to LLMs impact their reasoning capabilities and identify the internal mechanisms encoding persona-specific information.

Method: Applied activation patching to analyze the role of early MLP layers and middle MHA layers in processing persona-related information within LLMs.

Result: Early MLP layers encode both syntactic structure and semantic content of persona tokens, while middle MHA layers utilize these representations for output generation. The study also identifies attention heads focusing on racial or color-based identities.

Conclusion: The paper advances understanding of how LLMs integrate persona-specific factors into reasoning and highlights layers and attention heads involved in this process.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable versatility in adopting
diverse personas. In this study, we examine how assigning a persona influences
a model's reasoning on an objective task. Using activation patching, we take a
first step toward understanding how key components of the model encode
persona-specific information. Our findings reveal that the early Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) layers attend not only to the syntactic structure of the input
but also process its semantic content. These layers transform persona tokens
into richer representations, which are then used by the middle Multi-Head
Attention (MHA) layers to shape the model's output. Additionally, we identify
specific attention heads that disproportionately attend to racial and
color-based identities.

### [433] [Fusing CFD and measurement data using transfer learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20576)
*Alexander Barklage,Philipp Bekemeyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel neural network-based method for aerodynamic data fusion, leveraging transfer learning to merge simulation and measurement data for improved accuracy and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current aerodynamic analysis methods have limitations due to differences in data accuracy and spatial resolution between simulations and measurements.

Method: A neural network is trained using high-resolution simulation data to capture spatial features, followed by transfer learning using sparse measurement data to correct systematic errors.

Result: The proposed method outperforms the traditional linear approach (proper orthogonal decomposition) by producing accurate solutions near nonlinear conditions and offers predictions for various flow conditions.

Conclusion: This neural network-based approach is more effective and flexible than traditional methods, and its training strategy can be expanded to support advanced architectures in the future.

Abstract: Aerodynamic analysis during aircraft design usually involves methods of
varying accuracy and spatial resolution, which all have their advantages and
disadvantages. It is therefore desirable to create data-driven models which
effectively combine these advantages. Such data fusion methods for distributed
quantities mainly rely on proper orthogonal decomposition as of now, which is a
linear method. In this paper, we introduce a non-linear method based on neural
networks combining simulation and measurement data via transfer learning. The
network training accounts for the heterogeneity of the data, as simulation data
usually features a high spatial resolution, while measurement data is sparse
but more accurate. In a first step, the neural network is trained on simulation
data to learn spatial features of the distributed quantities. The second step
involves transfer learning on the measurement data to correct for systematic
errors between simulation and measurement by only re-training a small subset of
the entire neural network model. This approach is applied to a multilayer
perceptron architecture and shows significant improvements over the established
method based on proper orthogonal decomposition by producing more physical
solutions near nonlinearities. In addition, the neural network provides
solutions at arbitrary flow conditions, thus making the model useful for flight
mechanical design, structural sizing, and certification. As the proposed
training strategy is very general, it can also be applied to more complex
neural network architectures in the future.

*Fei Kong,Xiaohan Shan,Yanwei Hu,Jianmin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PhaseNAS is a Neural Architecture Search framework that uses dynamic phase transitions and a structured architecture template for better results, efficiency, and adaptability in vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between exploration and efficiency in NAS, and to improve the limitations of static strategies and ambiguous architecture representations in LLM-based NAS methods.

Method: The framework uses dynamic phase transitions based on real-time score thresholds and a structured architecture template language to guide architecture searches and code generation.

Result: PhaseNAS achieves higher accuracy and better ranking on NAS-Bench-Macro, reduces search time by up to 86% on CIFAR-10/100 while maintaining or improving accuracy, and produces optimized YOLOv8 variants for object detection with higher mAP and lower resource costs.

Conclusion: PhaseNAS efficiently enables adaptive and generalizable Neural Architecture Search for a variety of vision applications, overcoming significant challenges in the field.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is challenged by the trade-off between
search space exploration and efficiency, especially for complex tasks. While
recent LLM-based NAS methods have shown promise, they often suffer from static
search strategies and ambiguous architecture representations. We propose
PhaseNAS, an LLM-based NAS framework with dynamic phase transitions guided by
real-time score thresholds and a structured architecture template language for
consistent code generation. On the NAS-Bench-Macro benchmark, PhaseNAS
consistently discovers architectures with higher accuracy and better rank. For
image classification (CIFAR-10/100), PhaseNAS reduces search time by up to 86%
while maintaining or improving accuracy. In object detection, it automatically
produces YOLOv8 variants with higher mAP and lower resource cost. These results
demonstrate that PhaseNAS enables efficient, adaptive, and generalizable NAS
across diverse vision tasks.

### [435] [LoRA-PAR: A Flexible Dual-System LoRA Partitioning Approach to Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20999)
*Yining Huang,Bin Li,Keke Tang,Meilian Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoRA-PAR, a framework that partitions tasks and parameters based on cognitive demands inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow." It uses a two-stage fine-tuning process and achieves better efficiency while surpassing baseline results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the efficiency and performance of large-scale generative models by addressing task-specific demands using fewer, task-focused parameters.

Method: LoRA-PAR partitions tasks into System 1 (fast, intuitive) and System 2 (slow, logical) categories via multi-model role-playing and voting. It then scores parameter importance, applying a two-stage tuning: first supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for intuitive tasks, then reinforcement learning (RL) for logical tasks.

Result: Experiments validate that LoRA-PAR reduces active parameter usage while yielding performance that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art (SOTA) PEFT baselines.

Conclusion: LoRA-PAR successfully integrates a dual-system approach to lower computational costs and improve performance, making it an efficient fine-tuning strategy for large generative models.

Abstract: Large-scale generative models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-O1 benefit
substantially from chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet pushing their
performance typically requires vast data, large model sizes, and full-parameter
fine-tuning. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost,
most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise
allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different
response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes
two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and
System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that
different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for
tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step
logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework
that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using
fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task
data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on
importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training
System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and
intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to
reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the
two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while
matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.

### [436] [Deep Generative Models of Evolution: SNP-level Population Adaptation by Genomic Linkage Incorporation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20644)
*Julia Siekiera,Christian Schlötterer,Stefan Kramer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep generative neural network to study allele frequency trajectories in evolutionary experiments using Pool-Seq data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classic models like Wright-Fisher have limitations such as assuming independence between loci and parameter uncertainty. A more comprehensive approach is needed to analyze multivariate dependencies and reduce noise.

Method: A deep generative neural network is proposed to model evolutionary concepts by embedding allele frequency data with information from neighboring loci. Simulated Evolve and Resequencing (E&R) experiments were used for evaluation.

Result: The model successfully captures the distribution of allele frequency trajectories and demonstrates strong performance in estimating linkage disequilibrium (LD) from Pool-Seq data.

Conclusion: Deep generative models are effective for addressing challenges in evolutionary population genomics, particularly for LD estimation in Pool-Seq datasets with high dependencies.

Abstract: The investigation of allele frequency trajectories in populations evolving
under controlled environmental pressures has become a popular approach to study
evolutionary processes on the molecular level. Statistical models based on
well-defined evolutionary concepts can be used to validate different hypotheses
about empirical observations. Despite their popularity, classic statistical
models like the Wright-Fisher model suffer from simplified assumptions such as
the independence of selected loci along a chromosome and uncertainty about the
parameters. Deep generative neural networks offer a powerful alternative known
for the integration of multivariate dependencies and noise reduction. Due to
their high data demands and challenging interpretability they have, so far, not
been widely considered in the area of population genomics. To address the
challenges in the area of Evolve and Resequencing experiments (E&R) based on
pooled sequencing (Pool-Seq) data, we introduce a deep generative neural
network that aims to model a concept of evolution based on empirical
observations over time. The proposed model estimates the distribution of allele
frequency trajectories by embedding the observations from single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) with information from neighboring loci. Evaluation on
simulated E&R experiments demonstrates the model's ability to capture the
distribution of allele frequency trajectories and illustrates the
representational power of deep generative models on the example of linkage
disequilibrium (LD) estimation. Inspecting the internally learned
representations enables estimating pairwise LD, which is typically inaccessible
in Pool-Seq data. Our model provides competitive LD estimation in Pool-Seq data
high degree of LD when compared to existing methods.

### [437] [Novel Pivoted Cholesky Decompositions for Efficient Gaussian Process Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20678)
*Filip de Roos,Fabio Muratore*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes novel pivoting strategies for Cholesky decomposition to enhance efficiency and uncertainty reduction, especially for Gaussian processes, outperforming standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cholesky decomposition plays a crucial role in solving linear systems, but its efficiency and numerical stability can benefit from improved pivoting strategies. Applications in Bayesian nonparametric inference motivate the exploration of such enhancements.

Method: The authors derive new pivoting strategies by analyzing connections with entropy maximization common in active learning and experiment design. Tailored implementations of these strategies are benchmarked against traditional methods.

Result: The novel strategies are shown to be more effective in reducing uncertainty, performing on par or outperforming traditional methods in sparse regression and preconditioned iterative solvers with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed pivoting strategies advance the efficiency of Cholesky decomposition, making them advantageous for tasks in Gaussian processes while maintaining computational feasibility.

Abstract: The Cholesky decomposition is a fundamental tool for solving linear systems
with symmetric and positive definite matrices which are ubiquitous in linear
algebra, optimization, and machine learning. Its numerical stability can be
improved by introducing a pivoting strategy that iteratively permutes the rows
and columns of the matrix. The order of pivoting indices determines how
accurately the intermediate decomposition can reconstruct the original matrix,
thus is decisive for the algorithm's efficiency in the case of early
termination. Standard implementations select the next pivot from the largest
value on the diagonal. In the case of Bayesian nonparametric inference, this
strategy corresponds to greedy entropy maximization, which is often used in
active learning and design of experiments. We explore this connection in detail
and deduce novel pivoting strategies for the Cholesky decomposition. The
resulting algorithms are more efficient at reducing the uncertainty over a data
set, can be updated to include information about observations, and additionally
benefit from a tailored implementation. We benchmark the effectiveness of the
new selection strategies on two tasks important to Gaussian processes: sparse
regression and inference based on preconditioned iterative solvers. Our results
show that the proposed selection strategies are either on par or, in most
cases, outperform traditional baselines while requiring a negligible amount of
additional computation.

*Valentin Lafargue,Adriana Laurindo Monteiro,Emmanuelle Claeys,Laurent Risser,Jean-Michel Loubes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses manipulating datasets to meet fairness measures and how to detect such manipulations, leveraging entropic and optimal transport methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure AI algorithms comply with fairness regulations, specifically under the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, by addressing potential data manipulation to satisfy metrics like Disparate Impact.

Method: Proposed methods like entropic and optimal transport projections to minimally manipulate datasets while maintaining statistical indistinguishability, and analyzed mechanisms to detect such manipulation.

Result: The methods were validated through experiments on classical tabular datasets, demonstrating how fairness constraints can be artificially met and how to detect such cases.

Conclusion: Auditors are equipped with theoretical insights and practical recommendations to identify and combat dataset manipulations in fairness evaluations.

Abstract: Proving the compliance of AI algorithms has become an important challenge
with the growing deployment of such algorithms for real-life applications.
Inspecting possible biased behaviors is mandatory to satisfy the constraints of
the regulations of the EU Artificial Intelligence's Act. Regulation-driven
audits increasingly rely on global fairness metrics, with Disparate Impact
being the most widely used. Yet such global measures depend highly on the
distribution of the sample on which the measures are computed. We investigate
first how to manipulate data samples to artificially satisfy fairness criteria,
creating minimally perturbed datasets that remain statistically
indistinguishable from the original distribution while satisfying prescribed
fairness constraints. Then we study how to detect such manipulation. Our
analysis (i) introduces mathematically sound methods for modifying empirical
distributions under fairness constraints using entropic or optimal transport
projections, (ii) examines how an auditee could potentially circumvent fairness
inspections, and (iii) offers recommendations to help auditors detect such data
manipulations. These results are validated through experiments on classical
tabular datasets in bias detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a more accurate, interpretable, and computationally efficient diagnostic tool for prostate cancer by leveraging both textual and numerical clinical data.

Method: The study combines BERT for textual clinical notes with Random Forest for numerical lab data via a novel multimodal fusion strategy, conducting SHAP analysis and ablation studies for feature importance and complementary value.

Result: The system achieves 98% accuracy, 99% AUC on PLCO-NIH dataset, with significant improvements in intermediate cancer stage classification and an F1 score of 89%.

Conclusion: The proposed BERT+RF pipeline balances high performance, computational efficiency, and clinical interpretability, offering a practical diagnostic tool for hospitals.

Abstract: Prostate cancer, the second most prevalent male malignancy, requires advanced
diagnostic tools. We propose an explainable AI system combining BERT (for
textual clinical notes) and Random Forest (for numerical lab data) through a
novel multimodal fusion strategy, achieving superior classification performance
on PLCO-NIH dataset (98% accuracy, 99% AUC). While multimodal fusion is
established, our work demonstrates that a simple yet interpretable BERT+RF
pipeline delivers clinically significant improvements - particularly for
intermediate cancer stages (Class 2/3 recall: 0.900 combined vs 0.824
numerical/0.725 textual). SHAP analysis provides transparent feature importance
rankings, while ablation studies prove textual features' complementary value.
This accessible approach offers hospitals a balance of high performance
(F1=89%), computational efficiency, and clinical interpretability - addressing
critical needs in prostate cancer diagnostics.

*Sungjun Lim,Kangjun Noh,Youngjun Choi,Heeyoung Lee,Kyungwoo Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Uncertainty-driven Embedding Convolution (UEC), an approach that transforms deterministic text embeddings into probabilistic ones to improve robustness and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The variability in embedding model performance across domains highlights the need for ensemble techniques to combine complementary strengths effectively. Existing methods often fail to incorporate model uncertainty, which limits their reliability.

Method: The authors propose UEC, a method that transforms deterministic embeddings into probabilistic ones post-hoc, computes ensemble weights based on embedding uncertainty using a Bayes-optimal solution, and incorporates uncertainty into similarity scoring.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks for retrieval, classification, and semantic similarity tasks show that UEC consistently improves performance and robustness.

Conclusion: UEC's principled use of uncertainty modeling enhances the reliability and effectiveness of text embedding ensembles across tasks.

Abstract: Text embeddings are essential components in modern NLP pipelines. While
numerous embedding models have been proposed, their performance varies across
domains, and no single model consistently excels across all tasks. This
variability motivates the use of ensemble techniques to combine complementary
strengths. However, most existing ensemble methods operate on deterministic
embeddings and fail to account for model-specific uncertainty, limiting their
robustness and reliability in downstream applications. To address these
limitations, we propose Uncertainty-driven Embedding Convolution (UEC). UEC
first transforms deterministic embeddings into probabilistic ones in a post-hoc
manner. It then computes adaptive ensemble weights based on embedding
uncertainty, grounded in a Bayes-optimal solution under a surrogate loss.
Additionally, UEC introduces an uncertainty-aware similarity function that
directly incorporates uncertainty into similarity scoring. Extensive
experiments on retrieval, classification, and semantic similarity benchmarks
demonstrate that UEC consistently improves both performance and robustness by
leveraging principled uncertainty modeling.

TL;DR: The paper investigates token-level hallucination detection in foundational models using annotated data to understand variation in hallucination signals across token sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about the generation of untruthful content by foundational models have prompted research to enable real-time filtering and targeted correction at the token level.

Method: The authors utilize the RAGTruth corpus with token-level annotations and reproduced logits to analyze token-level hallucination signals and their dependence on a token's position within hallucinated spans.

Result: The study reveals that the first hallucinated token in a sequence has a stronger signal and is more detectable compared to subsequent conditional tokens.

Conclusion: Understanding token-level hallucination signals leads to improved monitoring and correction mechanisms, with the release of an analysis framework and supportive code enhancing research applications in this area.

Abstract: Hallucination, the generation of untruthful content, is one of the major
concerns regarding foundational models. Detecting hallucinations at the token
level is vital for real-time filtering and targeted correction, yet the
variation of hallucination signals within token sequences is not fully
understood. Leveraging the RAGTruth corpus with token-level annotations and
reproduced logits, we analyse how these signals depend on a token's position
within hallucinated spans, contributing to an improved understanding of
token-level hallucination. Our results show that the first hallucinated token
carries a stronger signal and is more detectable than conditional tokens. We
release our analysis framework, along with code for logit reproduction and
metric computation at https://github.com/jakobsnl/RAGTruth_Xtended.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional prediction methods struggle to capture spatial dependencies in operational building energy data, necessitating advanced techniques for reliable multi-building energy prediction.

Method: The approach builds a graph based on building features and environmental factors, applies a multi-level graph convolutional architecture with attention mechanisms, and introduces an interpretation technique for the graph structure.

Result: Experiments using the Building Data Genome Project 2 dataset show superior energy prediction performance compared to baselines, including XGBoost, SVR, FCNN, GRU, and Naive models.

Conclusion: The proposed method proves to be robust, generalizable, and interpretable, effectively capturing spatial relationships and building similarities for enhanced energy load predictions.

Abstract: Due to the extensive availability of operation data, data-driven methods show
strong capabilities in predicting building energy loads. Buildings with similar
features often share energy patterns, reflected by spatial dependencies in
their operational data, which conventional prediction methods struggle to
capture. To overcome this, we propose a multi-building prediction approach
using spatio-temporal graph neural networks, comprising graph representation,
graph learning, and interpretation. First, a graph is built based on building
characteristics and environmental factors. Next, a multi-level graph
convolutional architecture with attention is developed for energy prediction.
Lastly, a method interpreting the optimized graph structure is introduced.
Experiments on the Building Data Genome Project 2 dataset confirm superior
performance over baselines such as XGBoost, SVR, FCNN, GRU, and Naive,

TL;DR: The survey investigates explainable deep clustering for time series, identifying current limitations and proposing six research opportunities to enhance transparency and trustworthiness in analytic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep clustering is opaque and lacks interpretability, which limits its application in safety-critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and climate science.

Method: The survey systematically reviews methods and applications of explainable deep clustering, identifying common architectures and their limitations, and compares approaches across multiple domains.

Result: The analysis shows reliance on autoencoder and attention models, limited support for certain types of time series, and interpretability mostly treated as secondary.

Conclusion: The paper outlines six research opportunities to advance deep clustering by integrating built-in interpretability, adapting to live data, improving evaluation metrics, and involving human-in-the-loop refinement methods for domain-specific explanations.

Abstract: Deep clustering uncovers hidden patterns and groups in complex time series
data, yet its opaque decision-making limits use in safety-critical settings.
This survey offers a structured overview of explainable deep clustering for
time series, collecting current methods and their real-world applications. We
thoroughly discuss and compare peer-reviewed and preprint papers through
application domains across healthcare, finance, IoT, and climate science. Our
analysis reveals that most work relies on autoencoder and attention
architectures, with limited support for streaming, irregularly sampled, or
privacy-preserved series, and interpretability is still primarily treated as an
add-on. To push the field forward, we outline six research opportunities: (1)
combining complex networks with built-in interpretability; (2) setting up
clear, faithfulness-focused evaluation metrics for unsupervised explanations;
(3) building explainers that adapt to live data streams; (4) crafting
explanations tailored to specific domains; (5) adding human-in-the-loop methods
that refine clusters and explanations together; and (6) improving our
understanding of how time series clustering models work internally. By making
interpretability a primary design goal rather than an afterthought, we propose
the groundwork for the next generation of trustworthy deep clustering time
series analytics.

### [444] [Geometry of Neural Reinforcement Learning in Continuous State and Action Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20853)
*Saket Tiwari,Omer Gottesman,George Konidaris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the geometry of continuous state and action spaces in reinforcement learning (RL) and introduces the concept of a low-dimensional manifold of attainable states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While RL has been successful in continuous state and action spaces, theoretical understanding mostly focuses on finite cases. The paper aims to bridge this gap using a geometric perspective.

Method: The authors analyze the locally attained set of states and show that a two-layer neural policy trained with an actor-critic algorithm results in a low-dimensional manifold, whose dimensionality is tied to the action space's dimensionality. They empirically validate this using MuJoCo environments and a toy problem.

Result: Under certain conditions, the established manifold's dimensionality matches the action space's order. The concept is validated experimentally, and it is shown to improve RL models' performance for high-dimensional control problems.

Conclusion: This work is the first to theoretically link the geometry of continuous RL state spaces to their action spaces, offering both theoretical insights and practical implications for enhancing RL in high-dimensional tasks.

Abstract: Advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to its successful
application in complex tasks with continuous state and action spaces. Despite
these advances in practice, most theoretical work pertains to finite state and
action spaces. We propose building a theoretical understanding of continuous
state and action spaces by employing a geometric lens to understand the locally
attained set of states. The set of all parametrised policies learnt through a
semi-gradient based approach induces a set of attainable states in RL. We show
that the training dynamics of a two-layer neural policy induce a low
dimensional manifold of attainable states embedded in the high-dimensional
nominal state space trained using an actor-critic algorithm. We prove that,
under certain conditions, the dimensionality of this manifold is of the order
of the dimensionality of the action space. This is the first result of its
kind, linking the geometry of the state space to the dimensionality of the
action space. We empirically corroborate this upper bound for four MuJoCo
environments and also demonstrate the results in a toy environment with varying
dimensionality. We also show the applicability of this theoretical result by
introducing a local manifold learning layer to the policy and value function
networks to improve the performance in control environments with very high
degrees of freedom by changing one layer of the neural network to learn sparse
representations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study presents a multi-modal classification method using resting-state EEG and demographic/clinical features to effectively detect gait dysfunction in Parkinson's patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting gait dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease patients currently relies on subjective assessments or expensive tools, prompting the need for data-driven and scalable methods.

Method: The researchers developed Bi-cephalic Self-Attention Model (BiSAM) to integrate EEG features and descriptive variables for classification, tested across signal-only, descriptive-only, and multi-modal setups.

Result: Multi-modal BiSAM models with minimal EEG channels achieved an accuracy of up to 88%, significantly outperforming signal-only and descriptive-only methods.

Conclusion: Integrating EEG data with clinical/descriptive features provides an objective and scalable approach for detecting Parkinson-related gait dysfunction, aiding routine monitoring and early diagnosis.

Abstract: Parkinson Disease (PD) often results in motor and cognitive impairments,
including gait dysfunction, particularly in patients with freezing of gait
(FOG). Current detection methods are either subjective or reliant on
specialized gait analysis tools. This study aims to develop an objective,
data-driven, and multi-modal classification model to detect gait dysfunction in
PD patients using resting-state EEG signals combined with demographic and
clinical variables. We utilized a dataset of 124 participants: 42 PD patients
with FOG (PDFOG+), 41 without FOG (PDFOG-), and 41 age-matched healthy
controls. Features extracted from resting-state EEG and descriptive variables
(age, education, disease duration) were used to train a novel Bi-cephalic
Self-Attention Model (BiSAM). We tested three modalities: signal-only,
descriptive-only, and multi-modal, across different EEG channel subsets
(BiSAM-63, -16, -8, and -4). Signal-only and descriptive-only models showed
limited performance, achieving a maximum accuracy of 55% and 68%, respectively.
In contrast, the multi-modal models significantly outperformed both, with
BiSAM-8 and BiSAM-4 achieving the highest classification accuracy of 88%. These
results demonstrate the value of integrating EEG with objective descriptive
features for robust PDFOG+ detection. This study introduces a multi-modal,
attention-based architecture that objectively classifies PDFOG+ using minimal
EEG channels and descriptive variables. This approach offers a scalable and
efficient alternative to traditional assessments, with potential applications
in routine clinical monitoring and early diagnosis of PD-related gait
dysfunction.

### [446] [Online hierarchical partitioning of the output space in extreme multi-label data stream](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20894)
*Lara Neves,Afonso Lourenço,Alberto Cano,Goreti Marreiros*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces iHOMER, a framework for online multi-label learning, which offers improved performance over state-of-the-art baselines through adaptive label clustering and drift detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses challenges in mining data streams with multi-label outputs, such as evolving distributions, high-dimensional label spaces, sparse label occurrences, and complex label dependencies, all compounded by concept drift over time.

Method: The iHOMER framework incrementally clusters the label space based on Jaccard similarity, utilizes a global tree-based learner driven by a multivariate Bernoulli process, and incorporates drift detection to dynamically adapt its structure.

Result: Experiments conducted on 23 real-world datasets demonstrate that iHOMER achieves superior performance, outperforming global baselines by 23% and local baselines by 32%.

Conclusion: iHOMER proves to be a robust approach for addressing the challenges of online multi-label classification, effectively handling label correlations, drift, and adaptability to varying conditions.

Abstract: Mining data streams with multi-label outputs poses significant challenges due
to evolving distributions, high-dimensional label spaces, sparse label
occurrences, and complex label dependencies. Moreover, concept drift affects
not only input distributions but also label correlations and imbalance ratios
over time, complicating model adaptation. To address these challenges,
structured learners are categorized into local and global methods. Local
methods break down the task into simpler components, while global methods adapt
the algorithm to the full output space, potentially yielding better predictions
by exploiting label correlations. This work introduces iHOMER (Incremental
Hierarchy Of Multi-label Classifiers), an online multi-label learning framework
that incrementally partitions the label space into disjoint, correlated
clusters without relying on predefined hierarchies. iHOMER leverages online
divisive-agglomerative clustering based on \textit{Jaccard} similarity and a
global tree-based learner driven by a multivariate \textit{Bernoulli} process
to guide instance partitioning. To address non-stationarity, it integrates
drift detection mechanisms at both global and local levels, enabling dynamic
restructuring of label partitions and subtrees. Experiments across 23
real-world datasets show iHOMER outperforms 5 state-of-the-art global
baselines, such as MLHAT, MLHT of Pruned Sets and iSOUPT, by 23\%, and 12 local
baselines, such as binary relevance transformations of kNN, EFDT, ARF, and
ADWIN bagging/boosting ensembles, by 32\%, establishing its robustness for
online multi-label classification.

### [447] [Modeling User Behavior from Adaptive Surveys with Supplemental Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20919)
*Aman Shukla,Daniel Patrick Scantlebury,Rishabh Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LANTERN, a modular architecture that fuses survey-based data and contextual signals to model user behavior more effectively, outperforming traditional survey-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User behavior modeling is crucial for personalization and decision-making, but traditional surveys are limited by constraints like user fatigue and incomplete responses.

Method: The authors propose LANTERN, which prioritizes survey data through selective gating and late-fusion mechanisms, while incorporating external contextual signals only when relevant.

Result: LANTERN surpasses survey-only baselines in multi-label prediction tasks and demonstrates robust performance, especially for rare and frequent attributes, through its modular design.

Conclusion: LANTERN provides a scalable and extensible framework to enhance behavior modeling in survey-focused applications, balancing survey primacy with contextual data integration.

Abstract: Modeling user behavior is critical across many industries where understanding
preferences, intent, or decisions informs personalization, targeting, and
strategic outcomes. Surveys have long served as a classical mechanism for
collecting such behavioral data due to their interpretability, structure, and
ease of deployment. However, surveys alone are inherently limited by user
fatigue, incomplete responses, and practical constraints on their length making
them insufficient for capturing user behavior. In this work, we present LANTERN
(Late-Attentive Network for Enriched Response Modeling), a modular architecture
for modeling user behavior by fusing adaptive survey responses with
supplemental contextual signals. We demonstrate the architectural value of
maintaining survey primacy through selective gating, residual connections and
late fusion via cross-attention, treating survey data as the primary signal
while incorporating external modalities only when relevant. LANTERN outperforms
strong survey-only baselines in multi-label prediction of survey responses. We
further investigate threshold sensitivity and the benefits of selective
modality reliance through ablation and rare/frequent attribute analysis.
LANTERN's modularity supports scalable integration of new encoders and evolving
datasets. This work provides a practical and extensible blueprint for behavior
modeling in survey-centric applications.

*Hongzhi Zhang,Zhonglie Liu,Kun Meng,Jiameng Chen,Jia Wu,Bo Du,Di Lin,Yan Che,Wenbin Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method for pretraining protein representations that improves zero-shot compound-protein interaction (CPI) predictions by addressing challenges in protein representation learning and data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for better zero-shot CPI predictions arises from challenges such as overlooking subsequence interdependencies in protein structures and dependence on large datasets, which limit scalability and efficiency.

Method: The authors use subsequence reordering to capture dependencies between protein subsequences and apply length-variable protein augmentation for effective pretraining on small datasets.

Result: Their proposed method improves baseline model performance in CPI tasks, especially in zero-shot and data-scarce scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates superior performance in challenging scenarios compared to existing pretraining methods, making it a valuable advancement in drug development research.

Abstract: Given the vastness of chemical space and the ongoing emergence of previously
uncharacterized proteins, zero-shot compound-protein interaction (CPI)
prediction better reflects the practical challenges and requirements of
real-world drug development. Although existing methods perform adequately
during certain CPI tasks, they still face the following challenges: (1)
Representation learning from local or complete protein sequences often
overlooks the complex interdependencies between subsequences, which are
essential for predicting spatial structures and binding properties. (2)
Dependence on large-scale or scarce multimodal protein datasets demands
significant training data and computational resources, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
pretrains protein representations for CPI prediction tasks using subsequence
reordering, explicitly capturing the dependencies between protein subsequences.
Furthermore, we apply length-variable protein augmentation to ensure excellent
pretraining performance on small training datasets. To evaluate the model's
effectiveness and zero-shot learning ability, we combine it with various
baseline methods. The results demonstrate that our approach can improve the
baseline model's performance on the CPI task, especially in the challenging
zero-shot scenario. Compared to existing pre-training models, our model
demonstrates superior performance, particularly in data-scarce scenarios where
training samples are limited. Our implementation is available at

*Wei Shan Lee,Chi Kiu Althina Chau,Kei Chon Sio,Kam Ian Leong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a hybrid Fourier-neural architecture to bypass errors inherent in PINNs for fourth-order PDEs, achieving unprecedented accuracy and performance beyond traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs have been limited in precision for solving fourth-order partial differential equations, hindering their use in engineering due to a perceived error ceiling.

Method: A hybrid approach combining truncated Fourier series and deep neural networks is used, along with systematic harmonic optimization and a two-phase optimization strategy using Adam and L-BFGS algorithms.

Result: Achieved significant accuracy improvements with an L2 error of $1.94 \times 10^{-7}$, marking a 17-fold enhancement over traditional PINNs and up to 500 times better than classic numerical solutions.

Conclusion: Proper architectural and methodological design enables ultra-precision solutions for scientific computing, showcasing how machine learning can outperform conventional numerical methods.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have plateaued at errors of
$10^{-3}$-$10^{-4}$ for fourth-order partial differential equations, creating a
perceived precision ceiling that limits their adoption in engineering
applications. We break through this barrier with a hybrid Fourier-neural
architecture for the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation, achieving unprecedented L2
error of $1.94 \times 10^{-7}$-a 17-fold improvement over standard PINNs and
\(15-500\times\) better than traditional numerical methods. Our approach
synergistically combines a truncated Fourier series capturing dominant modal
behavior with a deep neural network providing adaptive residual corrections. A
systematic harmonic optimization study revealed a counter-intuitive discovery:
exactly 10 harmonics yield optimal performance, with accuracy catastrophically
degrading from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-1}$ beyond this threshold. The two-phase
optimization strategy (Adam followed by L-BFGS) and adaptive weight balancing
enable stable ultra-precision convergence. GPU-accelerated implementation
achieves sub-30-minute training despite fourth-order derivative complexity. By
addressing 12 critical gaps in existing approaches-from architectural rigidity
to optimization landscapes-this work demonstrates that ultra-precision is
achievable through proper design, opening new paradigms for scientific
computing where machine learning can match or exceed traditional numerical
methods.

*Tianhao Wang,Simon Klancher,Kunal Mukherjee,Josh Wiedemeier,Feng Chen,Murat Kantarcioglu,Kangkook Jee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ProvCreator, a framework for generating synthetic graphs with complex heterogeneous schemas using transformer-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for synthetic graph generation are limited to simple, homogeneous structures, making them unsuitable for complex real-world applications.

Method: ProvCreator employs a graph-to-sequence encoder-decoder framework powered by large language models, capable of compressing and losslessly encoding graphs for structured generation.

Result: The framework was tested on cybersecurity system provenance graphs and knowledge graphs, demonstrating its ability to model intricate dependencies and generate realistic, privacy-conscious datasets.

Conclusion: ProvCreator successfully addresses the challenges of synthetic graph generation for complex heterogeneous structures, enabling applications in domains requiring semantic and structural fidelity.

Abstract: The rise of graph-structured data has driven interest in graph learning and
synthetic data generation. While successful in text and image domains,
synthetic graph generation remains challenging -- especially for real-world
graphs with complex, heterogeneous schemas. Existing research has focused
mostly on homogeneous structures with simple attributes, limiting their
usefulness and relevance for application domains requiring semantic fidelity.
  In this research, we introduce ProvCreator, a synthetic graph framework
designed for complex heterogeneous graphs with high-dimensional node and edge
attributes. ProvCreator formulates graph synthesis as a sequence generation
task, enabling the use of transformer-based large language models. It features
a versatile graph-to-sequence encoder-decoder that 1. losslessly encodes graph
structure and attributes, 2. efficiently compresses large graphs for contextual
modeling, and 3. supports end-to-end, learnable graph generation.
  To validate our research, we evaluate ProvCreator on two challenging domains:
system provenance graphs in cybersecurity and knowledge graphs from
IntelliGraph Benchmark Dataset. In both cases, ProvCreator captures intricate
dependencies between structure and semantics, enabling the generation of
realistic and privacy-aware synthetic datasets.

*Rongyao Cai,Ming Jin,Qingsong Wen,Kexin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents DARSD, a domain adaptation method for time series data that aims to improvise on domain shift issues by representation space decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of domain shift in time-series analysis, where models struggle to generalize across domains with similar yet different distributions.

Method: The proposed DARSD framework incorporates three components: adversarial learnable domain-invariant basis, a pseudo-labeling mechanism, and a hybrid contrastive optimization strategy for disentangling transferable knowledge from features.

Result: The method outperformed 12 UDA algorithms in experiments on four datasets (WISDM, HAR, HHAR, and MFD), achieving optimal results in 35 out of 53 scenarios.

Conclusion: DARSD effectively tackles domain shift by aligning feature distributions and disentangling transferable knowledge, demonstrating improved performance in cross-domain time-series analysis tasks.

Abstract: Domain shift poses a fundamental challenge in time series analysis, where
models trained on source domain often fail dramatically when applied in target
domain with different yet similar distributions. While current unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) methods attempt to align cross-domain feature
distributions, they typically treat features as indivisible entities, ignoring
their intrinsic compositions that governs domain adaptation. We introduce
DARSD, a novel UDA framework with theoretical explainability that explicitly
realizes UDA tasks from the perspective of representation space decomposition.
Our core insight is that effective domain adaptation requires not just
alignment, but principled disentanglement of transferable knowledge from mixed
representations. DARSD consists three synergistic components: (I) An
adversarial learnable common invariant basis that projects original features
into a domain-invariant subspace while preserving semantic content; (II) A
prototypical pseudo-labeling mechanism that dynamically separates target
features based on confidence, hindering error accumulation; (III) A hybrid
contrastive optimization strategy that simultaneously enforces feature
clustering and consistency while mitigating emerging distribution gaps.
Comprehensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets (WISDM, HAR,
HHAR, and MFD) demonstrate DARSD's superiority against 12 UDA algorithms,
achieving optimal performance in 35 out of 53 cross-domain scenarios.

*Chao Wu,Zhenyi Wang,Kangxian Xie,Naresh Kumar Devulapally,Vishnu Suresh Lokhande,Mingchen Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a model-agnostic framework (SAE Debias) to reduce gender bias in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models using sparse autoencoders without retraining or architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the prevalent gender bias in T2I diffusion models, where professions are often stereotypically associated with specific genders.

Method: SAE Debias uses a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender bias dataset to identify and suppress gender-relevant directions in the latent feature space, achieving a more balanced output.

Result: The framework significantly reduces gender bias across various T2I models, including Stable Diffusion versions, while maintaining high-quality image generation.

Conclusion: SAE Debias is an interpretable and reusable debiasing tool that advances fairness in generative AI, serving as a socially responsible approach for mitigating bias.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often exhibit gender bias, particularly
by generating stereotypical associations between professions and gendered
subjects. This paper presents SAE Debias, a lightweight and model-agnostic
framework for mitigating such bias in T2I generation. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require
model-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates
directly within the feature space without retraining or architectural
modifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender
bias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the
sparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased
direction per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed
during inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs.
Trained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing
direction, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased
subspaces. Extensive evaluations across multiple T2I models, including Stable
Diffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, and SDXL, demonstrate that SAE Debias substantially
reduces gender bias while preserving generation quality. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to apply sparse autoencoders for identifying
and intervening in gender bias within T2I models. These findings contribute
toward building socially responsible generative AI, providing an interpretable
and model-agnostic tool to support fairness in text-to-image generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SmallThinker, a set of LLMs specifically designed for resource-constrained local devices, achieving efficiency and strong performance without relying on GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to rethink LLM design for local devices with limited computational power, memory, and storage, as current LLMs are predominantly designed for GPU-driven cloud infrastructure.

Method: The authors propose a deployment-aware architecture with innovations like two-level sparse structures (fine-grained MoE and sparse feed-forward networks), a pre-attention router to mask I/O latency, and a memory-efficient NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism.

Result: SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and SmallThinker-21B-A3B outperform comparable LLMs while demonstrating exceptional on-device performance, achieving over 20 tokens/s on consumer CPUs with minimal memory requirements.

Conclusion: SmallThinker demonstrates that LLMs specifically architected for local devices can rival and even outperform cloud-optimized models, challenging the need for GPU-powered infrastructures in certain use cases.

Abstract: While frontier large language models (LLMs) continue to push capability
boundaries, their deployment remains confined to GPU-powered cloud
infrastructure. We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, a family of LLMs
natively designed - not adapted - for the unique constraints of local devices:
weak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional
approaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect
SmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our
innovation lies in a deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints
into design principles. First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure
combining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward
networks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model
capacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a
pre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch
expert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding
storage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for
memory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to
slash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and
SmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and
even outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly
eliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both
models exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB
and 8GB of memory respectively. SmallThinker is publicly available at
hf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-4BA0.6B-Instruct and

TL;DR: The paper proposes a modular framework (MDM-OC) to merge, update, and undo fine-tuned machine learning models efficiently, overcoming issues like task interference and catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges faced in machine learning practices such as model merging, continual learning, and reversibility, which often lead to task interference, catastrophic forgetting, and compliance issues.

Method: The framework encodes task-specific models as 'deltas' from a shared base, projecting them into orthogonal subspaces to avoid conflict. Gradient-based optimization merges these deltas, supporting strategies like elastic weight consolidation and synthetic replay for stability.

Result: Experiments in vision and NLP benchmarks show that MDM-OC improves accuracy, backward transfer, and fidelity of model unmerging while maintaining memory efficiency and computational feasibility.

Conclusion: MDM-OC provides a scalable and principled approach for creating modular AI systems, balancing performance, compliance, and resource efficiency.

Abstract: In real-world machine learning deployments, models must be continually
updated, composed, and when required, selectively undone. However, existing
approaches to model merging and continual learning often suffer from task
interference, catastrophic forgetting, or lack of reversibility. We propose
Modular Delta Merging with Orthogonal Constraints (MDM-OC), a novel framework
that enables scalable, interference-free, and reversible composition of
fine-tuned models. Each task-specific model is encoded as a delta from a shared
base and projected into an orthogonal subspace to eliminate conflict. These
projected deltas are then merged via gradient-based optimization to form a
unified model that retains performance across tasks. Our approach supports
continual integration of new models, structured unmerging for compliance such
as GDPR requirements, and model stability via elastic weight consolidation and
synthetic replay. Extensive experiments on vision and natural language
processing benchmarks demonstrate that MDM-OC outperforms prior baselines in
accuracy, backward transfer, and unmerge fidelity, while remaining
memory-efficient and computationally tractable. This framework offers a
principled solution for modular and compliant AI system design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most deep learning models excel in performance but are black-box systems, limiting their use in applications requiring transparency.

Method: CFNs compose elementary mathematical functions with clear semantics, supporting diverse compositional patterns and enabling efficient training via gradient descent.

Result: CFNs achieve competitive accuracy (96.24% on CIFAR-10) and outperform other interpretable models like Explainable Boosting Machines.

Conclusion: By combining deep learning's expressiveness with mathematical interpretability, CFNs provide robust solutions for domains needing performance and accountability.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) deliver impressive performance but their
black-box nature limits deployment in high-stakes domains requiring
transparency. We introduce Compositional Function Networks (CFNs), a novel
framework that builds inherently interpretable models by composing elementary
mathematical functions with clear semantics. Unlike existing interpretable
approaches that are limited to simple additive structures, CFNs support diverse
compositional patterns -- sequential, parallel, and conditional -- enabling
complex feature interactions while maintaining transparency. A key innovation
is that CFNs are fully differentiable, allowing efficient training through
standard gradient descent. We demonstrate CFNs' versatility across multiple
domains, from symbolic regression to image classification with deep
hierarchical networks. Our empirical evaluation shows CFNs achieve competitive
performance against black-box models (96.24% accuracy on CIFAR-10) while
outperforming state-of-the-art interpretable models like Explainable Boosting
Machines. By combining the hierarchical expressiveness and efficient training
of deep learning with the intrinsic interpretability of well-defined
mathematical functions, CFNs offer a powerful framework for applications where
both performance and accountability are paramount.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study discusses simplifying anomaly localization tests for sensor data systems by using a fixed term in the Shapley value calculation instead of computing it fully.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to enhance computational efficiency in anomaly localization tests while maintaining the effectiveness of the Shapley value approach.

Method: Experiments utilizing a mathematical anomaly model and proof for independent observation cases; dependent cases are not proven.

Result: Lower complexity achieved with identical error probability for simplified tests in independent cases.

Conclusion: Using a fixed term in the Shapley value calculation is effective for independent observations, though dependent cases remain unproven.

Abstract: Recent publications have suggested using the Shapley value for anomaly
localization for sensor data systems. Using a reasonable mathematical anomaly
model for full control, experiments indicate that using a single fixed term in
the Shapley value calculation achieves a lower complexity anomaly localization
test, with the same probability of error, as a test using the Shapley value for
all cases tested. A proof demonstrates these conclusions must be true for all
independent observation cases. For dependent observation cases, no proof is
available.

*Mayumi Nakano,Yuya Seki,Shuta Kikuchi,Shu Tanaka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses performance stagnation in Factorization Machine with Annealing (FMA) by proposing a method for dataset construction that prioritizes recent data points, enhancing optimization results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of performance stagnation in FMA caused by the dilution of new data points within large datasets during optimization iterations.

Method: The authors developed a sequential dataset construction technique that limits the dataset size by retaining only the most recent data points for training the factorization machine.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrated that the modified FMA achieves better optimization results at a lower cost and with fewer evaluations of the black-box function compared to the conventional approach.

Conclusion: Adopting the proposed dataset strategy improves the efficiency and effectiveness of FMA in black-box optimization tasks, indicating its potential for broader application.

Abstract: Black-box (BB) optimization problems aim to identify an input that minimizes
the output of a function (the BB function) whose input-output relationship is
unknown. Factorization machine with annealing (FMA) is a promising approach to
this task, employing a factorization machine (FM) as a surrogate model to
iteratively guide the solution search via an Ising machine. Although FMA has
demonstrated strong optimization performance across various applications, its
performance often stagnates as the number of optimization iterations increases.
One contributing factor to this stagnation is the growing number of data points
in the dataset used to train FM. It is hypothesized that as more data points
are accumulated, the contribution of newly added data points becomes diluted
within the entire dataset, thereby reducing their impact on improving the
prediction accuracy of FM. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for
sequential dataset construction that retains at most a specified number of the
most recently added data points. This strategy is designed to enhance the
influence of newly added data points on the surrogate model. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed FMA achieves lower-cost solutions
with fewer BB function evaluations compared to the conventional FMA.

Motivation: Challenges in MI-EEG decoding involve inter-subject variability and costly calibration for new users. Existing MSDA approaches often incorporate irrelevant sources and neglect discriminative structures.

Method: The method employs a pretrained Brain Foundation Model for dynamic source selection and uses Cauchy-Schwarz and Conditional CS divergences for joint feature and decision-level alignment.

Result: Evaluations on benchmark MI-EEG datasets show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed framework also demonstrates scalability and efficiency by reducing training time without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a significant advancement in MI-EEG decoding by reducing negative transfer and computational overhead, while enhancing class discriminability and domain invariance.

Abstract: Decoding motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, a key
non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm for controlling external
systems, has been significantly advanced by deep learning. However, MI-EEG
decoding remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject variability and
limited labeled target data, which necessitate costly calibration for new
users. Many existing multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods
indiscriminately incorporate all available source domains, disregarding the
large inter-subject differences in EEG signals, which leads to negative
transfer and excessive computational costs. Moreover, while many approaches
focus on feature distribution alignment, they often neglect the explicit
dependence between features and decision-level outputs, limiting their ability
to preserve discriminative structures. To address these gaps, we propose a
novel MSDA framework that leverages a pretrained large Brain Foundation Model
(BFM) for dynamic and informed source subject selection, ensuring only relevant
sources contribute to adaptation. Furthermore, we employ Cauchy-Schwarz (CS)
and Conditional CS (CCS) divergences to jointly perform feature-level and
decision-level alignment, enhancing domain invariance while maintaining class
discriminability. Extensive evaluations on two benchmark MI-EEG datasets
demonstrate that our framework outperforms a broad range of state-of-the-art
baselines. Additional experiments with a large source pool validate the
scalability and efficiency of BFM-guided selection, which significantly reduces
training time without sacrificing performance.

*Zedong Wang,Siyuan Li,Dan Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Rep-MTL is a Multi-Task Learning approach focusing on shared representation spaces rather than just optimizer-centric gradient tactics for better task complementarity and reduced negative transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Multi-Task Optimization strategies struggle with delivering consistent performance gains, as they predominantly focus on resolving conflicts via loss scaling and gradient manipulation without leveraging inter-task complementarities effectively.

Method: Rep-MTL leverages representation-level task saliency, using entropy-based penalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, to balance task-specific optimization and shared learning while minimizing negative transfer.

Result: Rep-MTL demonstrates competitive performance across four challenging MTL benchmarks and proves its ability to balance task-specific and cross-task learning via Power Law exponent analysis.

Conclusion: Rep-MTL effectively facilitates complementary task interactions in MTL through representation-level operations, offering competitive gains with simpler weighting strategies and higher efficiency.

Abstract: Despite the promise of Multi-Task Learning in leveraging complementary
knowledge across tasks, existing multi-task optimization (MTO) techniques
remain fixated on resolving conflicts via optimizer-centric loss scaling and
gradient manipulation strategies, yet fail to deliver consistent gains. In this
paper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions
naturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations
complementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the
inter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition
leads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to
quantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared
representation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based
penalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate
negative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks
instead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary
information sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL
benchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results
show that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves
competitive performance gains with favorable efficiency. Beyond standard
performance metrics, Power Law exponent analysis demonstrates Rep-MTL's
efficacy in balancing task-specific learning and cross-task sharing. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional hard and soft reset methods in spiking neural networks that lead to information loss or uniform treatment.

Method: The paper proposes an adaptive reset neuron that links input, output, and reset mechanisms, combined with a straightforward threshold adjustment strategy.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated excellent performance on various datasets with sustained low energy consumption.

Conclusion: The adaptive reset neuron effectively overcomes existing reset method issues, improving the spiking neural network's functionality without compromising energy efficiency.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks possess the advantage of low energy consumption due
to their event-driven nature. Compared with binary spike outputs, their
inherent floating-point dynamics are more worthy of attention. The threshold
level and reset mode of neurons play a crucial role in determining the number
and timing of spikes. The existing hard reset method causes information loss,
while the improved soft reset method adopts a uniform treatment for neurons. In
response to this, this paper designs an adaptive reset neuron, establishing the
correlation between input, output and reset, and integrating a simple yet
effective threshold adjustment strategy. It achieves excellent performance on
various datasets while maintaining the advantage of low energy consumption.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper reveals the duality between flow matching in generative models and particle swarm optimization (PSO) in evolutionary computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover intrinsic mathematical and operational similarities between flow matching and PSO, potentially unifying these two approaches under a single framework.

Method: Analyzed the mathematical formulations and optimization methods, showing both as dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations and interconnected by their evolutionary processes.

Result: The study identifies flow matching as a continuous generalization of PSO and PSO as a discrete implementation of swarm intelligence, establishing their theoretical connections.

Conclusion: The findings pave a theoretical pathway for hybrid algorithm development, improving PSO using flow matching and vice versa, while opening new avenues for research in swarm intelligence and generative models.

Abstract: This paper preliminarily investigates the duality between flow matching in
generative models and particle swarm optimization (PSO) in evolutionary
computation. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal the intrinsic connections
between these two approaches in terms of their mathematical formulations and
optimization mechanisms: the vector field learning in flow matching shares
similar mathematical expressions with the velocity update rules in PSO; both
methods follow the fundamental framework of progressive evolution from initial
to target distributions; and both can be formulated as dynamical systems
governed by ordinary differential equations. Our study demonstrates that flow
matching can be viewed as a continuous generalization of PSO, while PSO
provides a discrete implementation of swarm intelligence principles. This
duality understanding establishes a theoretical foundation for developing novel
hybrid algorithms and creates a unified framework for analyzing both methods.
Although this paper only presents preliminary discussions, the revealed
correspondences suggest several promising research directions, including
improving swarm intelligence algorithms based on flow matching principles and
enhancing generative models using swarm intelligence concepts.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces MPaGE, a framework combining LLMs and Pareto Front Grid for efficient, diverse heuristic generation in multi-objective optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional and existing LLM-based approaches in solving Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOP), particularly their inefficiency in dealing with diverse heuristics and runtime performance.

Method: The proposed method, MPaGE, enhances the SEMO framework by integrating LLMs with the Pareto Front Grid technique, guiding heuristic generation based on semantic diversity and performance.

Result: MPaGE achieves superior performance compared to existing LLM-based frameworks and performs competitively with traditional MOEAs, while demonstrating faster runtime.

Conclusion: The integration of the Pareto Front Grid approach with LLMs effectively addresses runtime efficiency and promotes heuristic diversity, advancing solutions for MOCOP.

Abstract: Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOP) frequently arise
in practical applications that require the simultaneous optimization of
conflicting objectives. Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be
effective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter
tuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently,
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has
opened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced
language understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most
existing approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often
neglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic
diversity in multi-objective settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Multi-heuristics for MOCOP via Pareto-Grid-guided Evolution of LLMs (MPaGE), a
novel enhancement of the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (SEMO)
framework that leverages LLMs and Pareto Front Grid (PFG) technique. By
partitioning the objective space into grids and retaining top-performing
candidates to guide heuristic generation, MPaGE utilizes LLMs to prioritize
heuristics with semantically distinct logical structures during variation, thus
promoting diversity and mitigating redundancy within the population. Through
extensive evaluations, MPaGE demonstrates superior performance over existing
LLM-based frameworks, and achieves competitive results to traditional
Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), with significantly faster
runtime. Our code is available at: https://github.com/langkhachhoha/MPaGE.

TL;DR: The study proposes an algorithm portfolio approach for hyperparameter tuning in Coherent Ising Machines (CIMs), achieving improvements in solution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter sensitivity in the CAC algorithm of CIMs necessitates efficient tuning methods to optimize solution quality in challenging combinatorial problems.

Method: Two tuning methods were proposed: Method A involves sequential optimization under a fixed trial budget, and Method B prioritizes hyperparameters after initial evaluations before sequential optimization. The evaluations were conducted on planted Wishart instances using Time to Solution (TTS) as a metric.

Result: Method A provided up to 1.47x improvement, while Method B offered up to 1.65x improvement compared to baseline hyperparameters.

Conclusion: The algorithm portfolio approach significantly boosts hyperparameter tuning efficiency for CIMs, enhancing solution quality effectively.

Abstract: Coherent Ising Machines (CIMs) have recently gained attention as a promising
computing model for solving combinatorial optimization problems. In particular,
the Chaotic Amplitude Control (CAC) algorithm has demonstrated high solution
quality, but its performance is highly sensitive to a large number of
hyperparameters, making efficient tuning essential. In this study, we present
an algorithm portfolio approach for hyperparameter tuning in CIMs employing
Chaotic Amplitude Control with momentum (CACm) algorithm. Our method
incorporates multiple search strategies, enabling flexible and effective
adaptation to the characteristics of the hyperparameter space. Specifically, we
propose two representative tuning methods, Method A and Method B. Method A
optimizes each hyperparameter sequentially with a fixed total number of trials,
while Method B prioritizes hyperparameters based on initial evaluations before
applying Method A in order. Performance evaluations were conducted on the
Supercomputer "Flow" at Nagoya University, using planted Wishart instances and
Time to Solution (TTS) as the evaluation metric. Compared to the baseline
performance with best-known hyperparameters, Method A achieved up to 1.47x
improvement, and Method B achieved up to 1.65x improvement. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm portfolio approach in enhancing
the tuning process for CIMs.

TL;DR: This paper presents ADVENTURE, an adaptive learning system for programming that uses an ontology to provide personalized exercises and hints, showing better results compared to random instructional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the experience and effectiveness of learning computer programming by providing personalized and adaptive support for students.

Method: The system utilizes an ontology (CONTINUOUS) to personalize learning and leverages the Elo Rating System to adjust exercise difficulty dynamically based on student performance. An experimental study compared adaptive and random learning modes using 1,186 code submissions.

Result: The adaptive mode outperformed the random mode in two significant features: the submission of correct answers and the number of pass concepts, highlighting the effectiveness of the personalized approach.

Conclusion: The adaptive learning support system, ADVENTURE, demonstrates potential in enhancing learners' programming practice by tailoring exercises to individual skill levels and using adaptive instructional methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces an ontology-based approach within an adaptive learning
support system for computer programming. This system (named ADVENTURE) is
designed to deliver personalized programming exercises that are tailored to
individual learners' skill levels. ADVENTURE utilizes an ontology, named
CONTINUOUS, which encompasses common concepts across multiple programming
languages. The system leverages this ontology not only to visualize programming
concepts but also to provide hints during practice programming exercises and
recommend subsequent programming concepts. The adaptive mechanism is driven by
the Elo Rating System, applied in an educational context to dynamically
estimate the most appropriate exercise difficulty for each learner. An
experimental study compared two instructional modes, adaptive and random, based
on six features derived from 1,186 code submissions across all the experimental
groups. The results indicate significant differences in four of six analyzed
features between these two modes. Notably, the adaptive mode demonstrates a
significant difference over the random mode in two features, the submission of
correct answers and the number of pass concepts. Therefore, these results
underscore that this adaptive learning support system may support learners in
practicing programming exercises.

TL;DR: The paper explores Higher-Order Datalog$^\neg$ and its expressive power under well-founded and stable model semantics, linking it to complexity classes and demonstrating hierarchical advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the expressive power and computational potential of Higher-Order Datalog$^\neg$ in relation to complexity classes like k-EXP and (k-NEXP).

Method: Examines Higher-Order Datalog$^\neg$ semantics and proves results using existential predicate variables, partially applied relations, and stratified fragments augmented with choice rules.

Result: Shows that $(k+1)$-Order Datalog$^\neg$ captures k-EXP under the well-founded semantics and co-(k-NEXP) or k-NEXP under stable model semantics. A stratified fragment retains similar expressive power.

Conclusion: Higher-Order Datalog$^\neg$ demonstrates a hierarchical expressive power tied to order and non-determinism, establishing its theoretical importance in higher-order logic programming.

Abstract: We investigate the expressive power of Higher-Order Datalog$^\neg$ under both
the well-founded and the stable model semantics, establishing tight connections
with complexity classes. We prove that under the well-founded semantics, for
all $k\geq 1$, $(k+1)$-Order Datalog$^\neg$ captures k-EXP, a result that holds
without explicit ordering of the input database. The proof of this fact can be
performed either by using the powerful existential predicate variables of the
language or by using partially applied relations and relation enumeration.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that this expressive power is retained within a
stratified fragment of the language. Under the stable model semantics, we show
that $(k+1)$-Order Datalog$^\neg$ captures co-(k-NEXP) using cautious reasoning
and k-NEXP using brave reasoning, again with analogous results for the
stratified fragment augmented with choice rules. Our results establish a
hierarchy of expressive power, highlighting an interesting trade-off between
order and non-determinism in the context of higher-order logic programming:
increasing the order of programs under the well-founded semantics can surpass
the expressive power of lower-order programs under the stable model semantics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reward-augmented learning framework for autonomous parking (RARLAP) to handle its intricate challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods for autonomous parking struggle to adapt to complex, dynamic, and spatially constrained environments.

Method: The proposed RARLAP uses structured reward design in combination with on-policy and off-policy optimization, tested in a Unity-based simulation.

Result: The on-policy Milestone-Augmented Reward strategy achieved a 91% success rate, outperforming simpler reward models and showing superior adaptability, training speed, and safety.

Conclusion: RARLAP demonstrates that structured reward augmentation significantly improves learning robustness and scalability for autonomous parking tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous parking (AP) represents a critical yet complex subset of
intelligent vehicle automation, characterized by tight spatial constraints,
frequent close-range obstacle interactions, and stringent safety margins.
However, conventional rule-based and model-predictive methods often lack the
adaptability and generalization needed to handle the nonlinear and
environment-dependent complexities of AP. To address these limitations, we
propose a reward-augmented learning framework for AP (RARLAP), that mitigates
the inherent complexities of continuous-domain control by leveraging structured
reward design to induce smooth and adaptable policy behavior, trained entirely
within a high-fidelity Unity-based custom 3D simulation environment. We
systematically design and assess three structured reward strategies: goal-only
reward (GOR), dense proximity reward (DPR), and milestone-augmented reward
(MAR), each integrated with both on-policy and off-policy optimization
paradigms. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the on-policy MAR achieves a
91\% success rate, yielding smoother trajectories and more robust behavior,
while GOR and DPR fail to guide effective learning. Convergence and trajectory
analyses demonstrate that the proposed framework enhances policy adaptability,
accelerates training, and improves safety in continuous control. Overall,
RARLAP establishes that reward augmentation effectively addresses complex
autonomous parking challenges, enabling scalable and efficient policy
optimization with both on- and off-policy methods. To support reproducibility,
the code accompanying this paper is publicly available.

TL;DR: This paper introduces GABRIL, a method incorporating human gaze data into imitation learning to mitigate causal confusion, and demonstrates improved performance and explainability in Atari and CARLA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address causal confusion in imitation learning, where models misinterpret spurious correlations as causal relationships, often leading to poor generalization in new environments.

Method: The authors propose GABRIL, which uses human gaze data collected during expert demonstrations as a regularization loss to guide representation learning and focus on causally relevant features.

Result: GABRIL significantly improves performance over behavior cloning with a 179% performance boost in Atari environments and 76% in CARLA benchmarks, compared to other baselines.

Conclusion: Integrating human gaze data into imitation learning helps mitigate causal confusion, improves agent performance, and provides enhanced explainability.

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) is a widely adopted approach which enables agents to
learn from human expert demonstrations by framing the task as a supervised
learning problem. However, IL often suffers from causal confusion, where agents
misinterpret spurious correlations as causal relationships, leading to poor
performance in testing environments with distribution shift. To address this
issue, we introduce GAze-Based Regularization in Imitation Learning (GABRIL), a
novel method that leverages the human gaze data gathered during the data
collection phase to guide the representation learning in IL. GABRIL utilizes a
regularization loss which encourages the model to focus on causally relevant
features identified through expert gaze and consequently mitigates the effects
of confounding variables. We validate our approach in Atari environments and
the Bench2Drive benchmark in CARLA by collecting human gaze datasets and
applying our method in both domains. Experimental results show that the
improvement of GABRIL over behavior cloning is around 179% more than the same
number for other baselines in the Atari and 76% in the CARLA setup. Finally, we
show that our method provides extra explainability when compared to regular IL
agents.

TL;DR: RAKOMO is a novel trajectory optimization method for legged manipulators combining K-Order Markov Optimization with a neural-network-based reachability margin for improved loco-manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legged robots require precise motion planning to perform manipulation tasks safely, but existing methods struggle with hybrid dynamics and leg constraints.

Method: RAKOMO integrates KOMO optimization with a neural network-based kinematically-aware criterion called reachability margin.

Result: RAKOMO showed faster convergence and better adaptability compared to baseline methods in simulation tests with a quadruped robot performing pick-and-place tasks.

Conclusion: RAKOMO enhances trajectory optimization for legged locomotion and manipulation tasks, combining neural network predictions with standard optimization techniques.

Abstract: Legged manipulators, such as quadrupeds equipped with robotic arms, require
motion planning techniques that account for their complex kinematic constraints
in order to perform manipulation tasks both safely and effectively. However,
trajectory optimization methods often face challenges due to the hybrid
dynamics introduced by contact discontinuities, and tend to neglect leg
limitations during planning for computational reasons. In this work, we propose
RAKOMO, a path optimization technique that integrates the strengths of K-Order
Markov Optimization (KOMO) with a kinematically-aware criterion based on the
reachable region defined as reachability margin. We leverage a neural-network
to predict the margin and optimize it by incorporating it in the standard KOMO
formulation. This approach enables rapid convergence of gradient-based motion
planning -- commonly tailored for continuous systems -- while adapting it
effectively to legged manipulators, successfully executing loco-manipulation
tasks. We benchmark RAKOMO against a baseline KOMO approach through a set of
simulations for pick-and-place tasks with the HyQReal quadruped robot equipped
with a Kinova Gen3 robotic arm.

Conclusion: By combining data-driven insights with physics-informed constraints, this hybrid framework provides an effective, scalable, and interpretable solution for autonomous trajectory prediction in real-world urban settings.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of future agent trajectories is a critical challenge for
ensuring safe and efficient autonomous navigation, particularly in complex

trajectory prediction. Our method employs a variational Bayesian mixture model
to effectively capture the diverse range of potential future behaviors, moving
beyond traditional unimodal assumptions. Unlike prior approaches that
predominantly treat trajectory prediction as a data-driven regression task, our
framework incorporates physical realism through sector-specific boundary
conditions and Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based smoothing. These
constraints ensure that predicted trajectories are not only data-consistent but
also physically plausible, adhering to kinematic and dynamic principles.
Furthermore, our method produces interpretable and diverse trajectory
predictions, enabling enhanced downstream decision-making and planning in
autonomous driving systems. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets,
demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. Comprehensive

Motivation: Indoor environments, such as long straight corridors, cause degeneracy issues in particle filter-based 2D-SLAM, impacting its efficiency. Addressing this problem is crucial for better localization.

Method: An adaptive degeneracy optimization agent (DOA) was developed using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a specialized reward function. The DOA employs sensor weighting based on the degeneracy factor and incorporates a transfer learning module for better generalization.

Result: Experimental results highlight the success of the proposed model in improving degeneracy detection and optimization across different environments, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The research confirms that the PPO-based DOA enhances 2D-SLAM's reliability in degenerate environments, showcasing its practical applicability and superiority over existing solutions.

Abstract: Particle filter-based 2D-SLAM is widely used in indoor localization tasks due
to its efficiency. However, indoor environments such as long straight corridors
can cause severe degeneracy problems in SLAM. In this paper, we use Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) to train an adaptive degeneracy optimization agent
(DOA) to address degeneracy problem. We propose a systematic methodology to
address three critical challenges in traditional supervised learning
frameworks: (1) data acquisition bottlenecks in degenerate dataset, (2)
inherent quality deterioration of training samples, and (3) ambiguity in
annotation protocol design. We design a specialized reward function to guide
the agent in developing perception capabilities for degenerate environments.
Using the output degeneracy factor as a reference weight, the agent can
dynamically adjust the contribution of different sensors to pose optimization.
Specifically, the observation distribution is shifted towards the motion model
distribution, with the step size determined by a linear interpolation formula
related to the degeneracy factor. In addition, we employ a transfer learning
module to endow the agent with generalization capabilities across different
environments and address the inefficiency of training in degenerate
environments. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the
rationality of our model design and the role of transfer learning. We also
compare the proposed DOA with SOTA methods to prove its superior degeneracy
detection and optimization capabilities across various environments.

Motivation: To leverage skin sensors for intuitive and diverse robot operation by capturing and classifying multimodal tactile data.

Method: The study uses recurrent neural networks to classify contact motions based on multimodal skin sensor data and investigates optimal conditions for integrating hardware and software.

Result: Achieved over 95% accuracy in motion classification, enabling diverse robot actions using a dual-arm mobile manipulator.

Conclusion: Skin-Machine Interface with optimized multimodal sensing and compliant sensor support enhances robot operation capabilities effectively.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for utilizing skin sensors as a new
operation interface of complex robots. The skin sensors employed in this study
possess the capability to quantify multimodal tactile information at multiple
contact points. The time-series data generated from these sensors is
anticipated to facilitate the classification of diverse contact motions
exhibited by an operator. By mapping the classification results with robot
motion primitives, a diverse range of robot motions can be generated by
altering the manner in which the skin sensors are interacted with. In this
paper, we focus on a learning-based contact motion classifier employing
recurrent neural networks. This classifier is a pivotal factor in the success
of this framework. Furthermore, we elucidate the requisite conditions for
software-hardware designs. Firstly, multimodal sensing and its comprehensive
encoding significantly contribute to the enhancement of classification accuracy
and learning stability. Utilizing all modalities simultaneously as inputs to
the classifier proves to be an effective approach. Secondly, it is essential to
mount the skin sensors on a flexible and compliant support to enable the
activation of three-axis accelerometers. These accelerometers are capable of
measuring horizontal tactile information, thereby enhancing the correlation
with other modalities. Furthermore, they serve to absorb the noises generated
by the robot's movements during deployment. Through these discoveries, the
accuracy of the developed classifier surpassed 95 %, enabling the dual-arm
mobile manipulator to execute a diverse range of tasks via the Skin-Machine

Method: The authors propose Ag2x2, a framework that employs coordination-aware visual representations to encode object states and hand motion patterns while staying agent-agnostic.

Result: Ag2x2 achieved a 73.5% success rate across 13 diverse bimanual tasks, outperforming baseline methods and exceeding policies trained with expert-engineered rewards. It also demonstrated effectiveness for imitation learning.

Conclusion: Ag2x2 represents progress in scalable learning of complex bimanual robotic skills, offering robust performance across tasks without requiring human demonstrations or engineered rewards.

Abstract: Bimanual manipulation, fundamental to human daily activities, remains a
challenging task due to its inherent complexity of coordinated control. Recent
advances have enabled zero-shot learning of single-arm manipulation skills
through agent-agnostic visual representations derived from human videos;
however, these methods overlook crucial agent-specific information necessary
for bimanual coordination, such as end-effector positions. We propose Ag2x2, a
computational framework for bimanual manipulation through coordination-aware
visual representations that jointly encode object states and hand motion
patterns while maintaining agent-agnosticism. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Ag2x2 achieves a 73.5% success rate across 13 diverse bimanual tasks from
Bi-DexHands and PerAct2, including challenging scenarios with deformable
objects like ropes. This performance outperforms baseline methods and even
surpasses the success rate of policies trained with expert-engineered rewards.
Furthermore, we show that representations learned through Ag2x2 can be
effectively leveraged for imitation learning, establishing a scalable pipeline
for skill acquisition without expert supervision. By maintaining robust
performance across diverse tasks without human demonstrations or engineered
rewards, Ag2x2 represents a step toward scalable learning of complex bimanual
robotic skills.

*Chuan Cao,Xiaoning Wang,Wenqian Xi,Han Zhang,Weidong Chen,Jingchuan Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a calibration method to improve the alignment accuracy between millimeter-wave radar and camera systems using a novel 3D uncertainty-aware PnP algorithm (3DUPnP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate calibration between radar and camera systems is crucial for multimodal perception in robotics but remains challenging due to radar sensor noise and error propagation.

Method: A systematic calibration framework is developed using a spatial 3D uncertainty-aware PnP algorithm (3DUPnP) that accounts for spherical coordinate noise propagation and compensates for error expectations.

Result: The proposed method shows significant performance improvements in consistency and precision compared to the state-of-the-art CPnP baseline.

Conclusion: This solution offers robust calibration for systems with radar and cameras, particularly benefiting autonomous driving and robotics perception.

Abstract: 4D imaging radar is a type of low-cost millimeter-wave radar(costing merely
10-20$\%$ of lidar systems) capable of providing range, azimuth, elevation, and
Doppler velocity information. Accurate extrinsic calibration between
millimeter-wave radar and camera systems is critical for robust multimodal
perception in robotics, yet remains challenging due to inherent sensor noise
characteristics and complex error propagation. This paper presents a systematic
calibration framework to address critical challenges through a spatial 3d
uncertainty-aware PnP algorithm (3DUPnP) that explicitly models spherical
coordinate noise propagation in radar measurements, then compensating for
non-zero error expectations during coordinate transformations. Finally,
experimental validation demonstrates significant performance improvements over
state-of-the-art CPnP baseline, including improved consistency in simulations
and enhanced precision in physical experiments. This study provides a robust
calibration solution for robotic systems equipped with millimeter-wave radar
and cameras, tailored specifically for autonomous driving and robotic
perception applications.

*Zaar Khizar,Johann Laconte,Roland Lenain,Romuald Aufrere*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sensor to measure vegetation forces on robots for navigational safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots face challenges in unstructured environments with vegetation affecting safety and traversability.

Method: A novel sensor measures vegetation-induced forces experienced by robots; its effectiveness is confirmed experimentally.

Result: The sensor accurately captures force variations and aids in navigation-related decisions.

Conclusion: The sensor fosters better robot navigation and could drive new learning algorithms for traversability.

Abstract: In many applications, robots are increasingly deployed in unstructured and
natural environments where they encounter various types of vegetation.
Vegetation presents unique challenges as a traversable obstacle, where the
mechanical properties of the plants can influence whether a robot can safely
collide with and overcome the obstacle. A more nuanced approach is required to
assess the safety and traversability of these obstacles, as collisions can
sometimes be safe and necessary for navigating through dense or unavoidable
vegetation. This paper introduces a novel sensor designed to directly measure
the applied forces exerted by vegetation on a robot: by directly capturing the
push-back forces, our sensor provides a detailed understanding of the
interactions between the robot and its surroundings. We demonstrate the
sensor's effectiveness through experimental validations, showcasing its ability
to measure subtle force variations. This force-based approach provides a
quantifiable metric that can inform navigation decisions and serve as a
foundation for developing future learning algorithms.

*Ye Wang,Haodong Jing,Yang Liao,Yongqiang Ma,Nanning Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PlaneHEC, a hand-eye calibration method using depth cameras and planar constraints, achieves faster and more accurate results without complex models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view robotic calibration methods are often inefficient, overly complex, rely on geometric models, or require manual assistance.

Method: PlaneHEC employs planar constraints for calibration equations, uses a closed-form solution refined by iterative optimization, and makes use of depth cameras for universal applicability.

Result: PlaneHEC outperforms traditional point-cloud-based methods in simulated and real-world settings, delivering accurate and fast calibration results.

Conclusion: PlaneHEC offers a generalizable, interpretable, and efficient calibration solution, advancing multi-agent systems and embodied intelligence with innovative computational designs.

Abstract: Hand-eye calibration is an important task in vision-guided robotic systems
and is crucial for determining the transformation matrix between the camera
coordinate system and the robot end-effector. Existing methods, for multi-view
robotic systems, usually rely on accurate geometric models or manual
assistance, generalize poorly, and can be very complicated and inefficient.
Therefore, in this study, we propose PlaneHEC, a generalized hand-eye
calibration method that does not require complex models and can be accomplished
using only depth cameras, which achieves the optimal and fastest calibration
results using arbitrary planar surfaces like walls and tables. PlaneHEC
introduces hand-eye calibration equations based on planar constraints, which
makes it strongly interpretable and generalizable. PlaneHEC also uses a
comprehensive solution that starts with a closed-form solution and improves it
withiterative optimization, which greatly improves accuracy. We comprehensively
evaluated the performance of PlaneHEC in both simulated and real-world
environments and compared the results with other point-cloud-based calibration
methods, proving its superiority. Our approach achieves universal and fast
calibration with an innovative design of computational models, providing a
strong contribution to the development of multi-agent systems and embodied
intelligence.

### [479] [Think, Act, Learn: A Framework for Autonomous Robotic Agents using Closed-Loop Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19854)
*Anjali R. Menon,Rohit K. Sharma,Priya Singh,Chengyu Wang,Aurora M. Ferreira,Mateja Novak*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introducing a novel framework, 'Think, Act, Learn' (T-A-L), for enabling robots to autonomously adapt and refine policies using Large Language Models (LLMs) within a closed-loop cycle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the brittleness and inability of LLM-based robotic systems to adapt in dynamic physical environments, given their current reliance on open-loop planning.

Method: The T-A-L framework introduces a cycle where the robot uses an LLM to plan ('Think'), executes plans while collecting sensory feedback ('Act'), and refines its policies through causal analysis and memory updates ('Learn').

Result: The T-A-L framework achieves a 97% success rate on complex tasks, converges in an average of 9 trials, and generalizes well to unseen tasks, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: The T-A-L framework marks significant progress towards autonomous robotic systems capable of robust adaptation and policy refinement in dynamic environments.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into robotics has unlocked
unprecedented capabilities in high-level task planning. However, most current
systems operate in an open-loop fashion, where LLMs act as one-shot planners,
rendering them brittle and unable to adapt to unforeseen circumstances in
dynamic physical environments. To overcome this limitation, this paper
introduces the "Think, Act, Learn" (T-A-L) framework, a novel architecture that
enables an embodied agent to autonomously learn and refine its policies through
continuous interaction. Our framework establishes a closed-loop cycle where an
LLM first "thinks" by decomposing high-level commands into actionable plans.
The robot then "acts" by executing these plans while gathering rich, multimodal
sensory feedback. Critically, the "learn" module processes this feedback to
facilitate LLM-driven self-reflection, allowing the agent to perform causal
analysis on its failures and generate corrective strategies. These insights are
stored in an experiential memory to guide future planning cycles. We
demonstrate through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world
that our T-A-L agent significantly outperforms baseline methods, including
open-loop LLMs, Behavioral Cloning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning. Our
framework achieves over a 97% success rate on complex, long-horizon tasks,
converges to a stable policy in an average of just 9 trials, and exhibits
remarkable generalization to unseen tasks. This work presents a significant
step towards developing more robust, adaptive, and truly autonomous robotic
agents.

### [480] [Homotopy-aware Multi-agent Navigation via Distributed Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19860)
*Haoze Dong,Meng Guo,Chengyi He,Zhongkui Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a distributed trajectory planning framework to handle deadlocks in multi-agent systems by integrating global path planning with local trajectory optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the issue of frequent deadlocks in obstacle-dense environments when agents traverse narrow corridors simultaneously.

Method: The framework involves a global homotopy-aware path planning algorithm to select optimal paths and a local model predictive control-based optimization for safe trajectory generation, including an online replanning strategy.

Result: Simulation results show the method significantly reduces deadlocks, increasing success rates from 4%-13% to over 90% in dense scenarios.

Conclusion: By leveraging homotopy-aware global path planning and combining it with adaptive local adjustments, the proposed framework effectively mitigates deadlocks and enhances multi-agent trajectory planning.

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory planning requires ensuring both safety and efficiency,
yet deadlocks remain a significant challenge, especially in obstacle-dense
environments. Such deadlocks frequently occur when multiple agents attempt to
traverse the same long and narrow corridor simultaneously. To address this, we
propose a novel distributed trajectory planning framework that bridges the gap
between global path and local trajectory cooperation. At the global level, a
homotopy-aware optimal path planning algorithm is proposed, which fully
leverages the topological structure of the environment. A reference path is
chosen from distinct homotopy classes by considering both its spatial and
temporal properties, leading to improved coordination among agents globally. At
the local level, a model predictive control-based trajectory optimization
method is used to generate dynamically feasible and collision-free
trajectories. Additionally, an online replanning strategy ensures its
adaptability to dynamic environments. Simulations and experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach in mitigating deadlocks. Ablation studies
demonstrate that by incorporating time-aware homotopic properties into the
underlying global paths, our method can significantly reduce deadlocks and
improve the average success rate from 4%-13% to over 90% in randomly generated
dense scenarios.

*Ahmed Abouelazm,Mohammad Mahmoud,Conrad Walter,Oleksandr Shchetsura,Erne Hussong,Helen Gremmelmaier,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a no-code, graphical framework for scenario generation in autonomous driving validation, making it accessible to non-programmers and enhancing testing workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Validating autonomous driving systems is challenging due to the impracticality of extensive real-world testing and the technical barriers of current scenario generation tools.

Method: A no-code, graphical user interface framework relying on a graph-based scenario representation that supports both manual and automated scenario generation.

Result: The framework enables the easy creation, modification, and execution of traffic scenarios without coding knowledge, and supports integration with artificial intelligence for automated scenario generation.

Conclusion: The proposed no-code framework lowers the entry barrier for users, facilitates scalable and cost-effective scenario testing, and enhances accessibility for diverse stakeholders.

Abstract: Autonomous driving promises safer roads, reduced congestion, and improved
mobility, yet validating these systems across diverse conditions remains a
major challenge. Real-world testing is expensive, time-consuming, and sometimes
unsafe, making large-scale validation impractical. In contrast, simulation
environments offer a scalable and cost-effective alternative for rigorous
verification and validation. A critical component of the validation process is
scenario generation, which involves designing and configuring traffic scenarios
to evaluate autonomous systems' responses to various events and uncertainties.
However, existing scenario generation tools often require programming
knowledge, limiting accessibility for non-technical users. To address this
limitation, we present an interactive, no-code framework for scenario
generation. Our framework features a graphical interface that enables users to
create, modify, save, load, and execute scenarios without needing coding
expertise or detailed simulation knowledge. Unlike script-based tools such as
Scenic or ScenarioRunner, our approach lowers the barrier to entry and supports
a broader user base. Central to our framework is a graph-based scenario
representation that facilitates structured management, supports both manual and
automated generation, and enables integration with deep learning-based scenario
and behavior generation methods. In automated mode, the framework can randomly
sample parameters such as actor types, behaviors, and environmental conditions,
allowing the generation of diverse and realistic test datasets. By simplifying
the scenario generation process, this framework supports more efficient testing
workflows and increases the accessibility of simulation-based validation for
researchers, engineers, and policymakers.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel rolling tactile sensor incorporating a neuromorphic camera for rapid, high-resolution industrial surface inspection, surpassing previous methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for large-scale industrial surface inspection are either low in resolution or slow in obtaining measurements, calling for a faster, continuous, and high-resolution solution.

Method: The authors developed a tactile sensor with a rolling mechanism incorporating a neuromorphic camera, using an event-based multi-view stereo approach for 3D reconstruction, combined with a multi-reference Bayesian fusion strategy for accuracy enhancement.

Result: The proposed sensor achieved scanning speeds up to 0.5 m/s with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) below 100 microns, 11 times faster than prior methods. The Bayesian fusion strategy further improved accuracy by reducing the MAE by 25.2% and mitigated curvature errors.

Conclusion: The system offers a highly efficient and accurate solution for industrial surface inspection, outperforming previous tactile sensing methods both in scanning speed and precision, while also demonstrating high-speed feature recognition capabilities.

Abstract: Inspecting large-scale industrial surfaces like aircraft fuselages for
quality control requires capturing their precise 3D surface geometry at high
resolution. Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTSs) offer high local resolution
but require slow 'press-and-lift' measurements stitched for large areas.
Approaches with sliding or roller/belt VBTS designs provide measurements
continuity. However, they face significant challenges respectively: sliding
struggles with friction/wear and both approaches are speed-limited by
conventional camera frame rates and motion blur, making large-area scanning
time consuming. Thus, a rapid, continuous, high-resolution method is needed. We
introduce a novel tactile sensor integrating a neuromorphic camera in a rolling
mechanism to achieve this. Leveraging its high temporal resolution and
robustness to motion blur, our system uses a modified event-based multi-view
stereo approach for 3D reconstruction. We demonstrate state-of-the-art scanning
speeds up to 0.5 m/s, achieving Mean Absolute Error below 100 microns -- 11
times faster than prior continuous tactile sensing methods. A multi-reference
Bayesian fusion strategy enhances accuracy (reducing MAE by 25.2\% compared to
EMVS) and mitigates curvature errors. We also validate high-speed feature
recognition via Braille reading 2.6 times faster than previous approaches.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FP-LGN, a model to ground spatial language for uncertainty-aware fusion in human-robot collaboration. Testing demonstrates its robustness and performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of frameworks that effectively ground spatial language for robots to overcome sensing limitations in collaborative tasks.

Method: FP-LGN uses feature pyramid learning and three-stage curriculum training to model probability and capture aleatoric uncertainty from human spatial language.

Result: FP-LGN matched expert rules in Negative Log-Likelihood and displayed higher robustness with lower variation. Fusion results significantly improved human-robot collaboration.

Conclusion: Using FP-LGN to ground spatial language enables uncertainty-aware fusion, enhancing robot sensing and collaborative task efficiency.

Abstract: Fusing information from human observations can help robots overcome sensing
limitations in collaborative tasks. However, an uncertainty-aware fusion
framework requires a grounded likelihood representing the uncertainty of human
inputs. This paper presents a Feature Pyramid Likelihood Grounding Network
(FP-LGN) that grounds spatial language by learning relevant map image features
and their relationships with spatial relation semantics. The model is trained
as a probability estimator to capture aleatoric uncertainty in human language
using three-stage curriculum learning. Results showed that FP-LGN matched
expert-designed rules in mean Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) and demonstrated
greater robustness with lower standard deviation. Collaborative sensing results
demonstrated that the grounded likelihood successfully enabled
uncertainty-aware fusion of heterogeneous human language observations and robot
sensor measurements, achieving significant improvements in human-robot
collaborative task performance.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates advances in AI for robotics since the 1990s, identifies key challenges, and presents a research roadmap to enhance robot deployment and collaboration in human environments.

Motivation: To explore which AI technologies and methods can effectively address barriers and challenges in robot deployment while ensuring adaptability, safety, and human collaboration.

Method: The paper assesses AI technologies applicable to robotics, highlights necessary adaptations, and provides a research roadmap focused on datasets, tailored algorithms, predictability in human interaction, and explainability.

Result: The study acknowledges challenges in adapting AI to robotics, such as data diversity, human behavior prediction, and explainability, and outlines short- and medium-term research priorities.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the importance of designing robots capable of lifelong learning with guaranteed safety, minimized computational costs, and trust-building measures for successful human-robot interaction.

Abstract: AI technologies, including deep learning, large-language models have gone
from one breakthrough to the other. As a result, we are witnessing growing
excitement in robotics at the prospect of leveraging the potential of AI to
tackle some of the outstanding barriers to the full deployment of robots in our
daily lives. However, action and sensing in the physical world pose greater and
different challenges than analysing data in isolation. As the development and
application of AI in robotic products advances, it is important to reflect on
which technologies, among the vast array of network architectures and learning
models now available in the AI field, are most likely to be successfully
applied to robots; how they can be adapted to specific robot designs, tasks,
environments; which challenges must be overcome. This article offers an
assessment of what AI for robotics has achieved since the 1990s and proposes a
short- and medium-term research roadmap listing challenges and promises. These
range from keeping up-to-date large datasets, representatives of a diversity of
tasks robots may have to perform, and of environments they may encounter, to
designing AI algorithms tailored specifically to robotics problems but generic
enough to apply to a wide range of applications and transfer easily to a
variety of robotic platforms. For robots to collaborate effectively with
humans, they must predict human behavior without relying on bias-based
profiling. Explainability and transparency in AI-driven robot control are not
optional but essential for building trust, preventing misuse, and attributing
responsibility in accidents. We close on what we view as the primary long-term
challenges, that is, to design robots capable of lifelong learning, while
guaranteeing safe deployment and usage, and sustainable computational costs.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CLASP is a novel method for clothes manipulation using semantic keypoints to enable general-purpose tasks like folding, hanging, and flattening for various clothes types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for home service robots capable of general-purpose clothes manipulation, overcoming limitations of task-specific and clothes-specific approaches.

Method: CLASP employs semantic keypoints extracted from RGB-D images to link high-level task planning using vision language models and low-level execution via a skill library.

Result: Simulation studies showed CLASP's superiority over existing methods across diverse tasks and clothes types, with successful real-world application on a dual-arm robot system.

Conclusion: CLASP demonstrates effective generalization and performance in clothes manipulation tasks, bridging perception and action through semantic keypoints.

Abstract: Clothes manipulation, such as folding or hanging, is a critical capability
for home service robots. Despite recent advances, most existing methods remain
limited to specific tasks and clothes types, due to the complex,
high-dimensional geometry of clothes. This paper presents CLothes mAnipulation
with Semantic keyPoints (CLASP), which aims at general-purpose clothes
manipulation over different clothes types, T-shirts, shorts, skirts, long
dresses, ... , as well as different tasks, folding, flattening, hanging, ... .
The core idea of CLASP is semantic keypoints -- e.g., ''left sleeve'', ''right
shoulder'', etc. -- a sparse spatial-semantic representation that is salient
for both perception and action. Semantic keypoints of clothes can be reliably
extracted from RGB-D images and provide an effective intermediate
representation of clothes manipulation policies. CLASP uses semantic keypoints
to bridge high-level task planning and low-level action execution. At the high
level, it exploits vision language models (VLMs) to predict task plans over the
semantic keypoints. At the low level, it executes the plans with the help of a
simple pre-built manipulation skill library. Extensive simulation experiments
show that CLASP outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods on multiple tasks
across diverse clothes types, demonstrating strong performance and
generalization. Further experiments with a Franka dual-arm system on four
distinct tasks -- folding, flattening, hanging, and placing -- confirm CLASP's
performance on a real robot.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of robotic swarms for constructing aleatory architectures from entangled granular materials and investigates the impact of initial substrate conditions on robotic performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore alternative approaches in structure formation using robotic swarms for aleatory architectures, enabling new paradigms by manipulating and forming structures from granular materials.

Method: The study used a robophysical model where robotic platforms autonomously coordinated excavation, transport, and deposition of geometrically cohesive granular materials. Tensile testing was applied to analyze the substrates' mechanical properties.

Result: Robotic performance in transporting material showed up to a 75% variation based on initial substrate compression states. Tensile testing revealed the strong influence of compressive loading on material strength and cohesion.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the critical role of material properties such as packing and entanglement in robotic construction tasks, paving the way for future studies on robotic interaction mechanics with entangled materials.

Abstract: Construction throughout history typically assumes that its blueprints and
building blocks are pre-determined. However, recent work suggests that
alternative approaches can enable new paradigms for structure formation.
Aleatory architectures, or those which rely on the properties of their granular
building blocks rather than pre-planned design or computation, have thus far
relied on human intervention for their creation. We imagine that robotic swarms
could be valuable to create such aleatory structures by manipulating and
forming structures from entangled granular materials. To discover principles by
which robotic systems can effectively manipulate soft matter, we develop a
robophysical model for interaction with geometrically cohesive granular media
composed of u-shape particles. This robotic platform uses environmental signals
to autonomously coordinate excavation, transport, and deposition of material.
We test the effect of substrate initial conditions by characterizing robot
performance in two different material compaction states and observe as much as
a 75% change in transported mass depending on initial substrate compressive
loading. These discrepancies suggest the functional role that material
properties such as packing and cohesion/entanglement play in excavation and
construction. To better understand these material properties, we develop an
apparatus for tensile testing of the geometrically cohesive substrates, which
reveals how entangled material strength responds strongly to initial
compressive loading. These results explain the variation observed in robotic
performance and point to future directions for better understanding robotic
interaction mechanics with entangled materials.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SuperMag, a method using vision-based sensors to enhance the spatial resolution of magnetic-based tactile sensors for high-precision robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Magnetic-based tactile sensors have compact designs and operate at high frequencies but lack spatial resolution due to sparse arrays.

Method: The paper utilizes a conditional variational auto-encoder to reconstruct high-resolution tactile shapes from low-resolution magnetic-based sensor inputs, using synchronized data from co-designed sensors.

Result: The method achieved a 125 Hz sampling frequency and sub-2.5 ms inference times for tactile shape reconstruction.

Conclusion: SuperMag effectively enhances the tactile perception of magnetic-based sensors and has potential applications in precision robotics.

Abstract: Magnetic-based tactile sensors (MBTS) combine the advantages of compact
design and high-frequency operation but suffer from limited spatial resolution
due to their sparse taxel arrays. This paper proposes SuperMag, a tactile shape
reconstruction method that addresses this limitation by leveraging
high-resolution vision-based tactile sensor (VBTS) data to supervise MBTS
super-resolution. Co-designed, open-source VBTS and MBTS with identical contact
modules enable synchronized data collection of high-resolution shapes and
magnetic signals via a symmetric calibration setup. We frame tactile shape
reconstruction as a conditional generative problem, employing a conditional
variational auto-encoder to infer high-resolution shapes from low-resolution
MBTS inputs. The MBTS achieves a sampling frequency of 125 Hz, whereas the
shape reconstruction sustains an inference time within 2.5 ms. This
cross-modality synergy advances tactile perception of the MBTS, potentially
unlocking its new capabilities in high-precision robotic tasks.

*Matin Aghaei,Mohammad Ali Alomrani,Yingxue Zhang,Mahdi Biparva*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study re-evaluates the role of large language models (LLMs) in ObjectGoal Navigation. It finds that geometry-based heuristics, rather than LLM reasoning, contribute significantly to navigation improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify whether improvements in ObjectGoal Navigation are due to LLM reasoning or geometry-based heuristics.

Method: The authors replace advanced LLM-supported features with a geometry-based heuristic (DWFE) and analyze its performance. They also test a lightweight language prior (SHF) to assess its impact.

Result: DWFE significantly improved success and SPL metrics compared to previous baselines. The SHF further refined performance slightly, indicating geometry-based approaches play a major role.

Conclusion: Frontier geometry is the main driver of navigation success, not LLM reasoning. For LLM intelligence claims, additional metric-aware prompts or semantic graphs are needed.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often credited with recent leaps in
ObjectGoal Navigation, yet the extent to which they improve planning remains
unclear. We revisit this question on the HM3D-v1 validation split. First, we
strip InstructNav of its Dynamic Chain-of-Navigation prompt, open-vocabulary
GLEE detector and Intuition saliency map, and replace them with a simple
Distance-Weighted Frontier Explorer (DWFE). This geometry-only heuristic raises
Success from 58.0% to 61.1% and lifts SPL from 20.9% to 36.0% over 2 000
validation episodes, outperforming all previous training-free baselines.
Second, we add a lightweight language prior (SHF); on a 200-episode subset this
yields a further +2% Success and +0.9% SPL while shortening paths by five steps
on average. Qualitative trajectories confirm the trend: InstructNav back-tracks
and times-out, DWFE reaches the goal after a few islands, and SHF follows an
almost straight route. Our results indicate that frontier geometry, not
emergent LLM reasoning, drives most reported gains, and suggest that
metric-aware prompts or offline semantic graphs are necessary before
attributing navigation success to "LLM intelligence."

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid twinning framework that integrates digital and robotic testing for guidance, navigation, and control systems in spacecraft missions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for effective validation of safety-critical GNC systems in complex space environments.

Method: A unified digital-robotic twinning framework comprising three testbeds is proposed to validate multi-modal GNC systems through software- and hardware-in-the-loop testing.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated consistency between digital and robotic twins, showing it is a reliable pipeline for assessing GNC systems in LEO mission scenarios.

Conclusion: The hybrid twinning pipeline is validated as an innovative and realistic approach for verification of spacecraft GNC systems.

Abstract: In spacecraft Rendezvous, Proximity Operations (RPO), and Formation Flying
(FF), the Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC) system is safety-critical and
must meet strict performance requirements. However, validating such systems is
challenging due to the complexity of the space environment, necessitating a

real-world behavior. The key contribution of this paper is a unified,
end-to-end digital and robotic twinning framework that enables software- and
hardware-in-the-loop testing for multi-modal GNC systems. The robotic twin
includes three testbeds at Stanford's Space Rendezvous Laboratory (SLAB): the
GNSS and Radiofrequency Autonomous Navigation Testbed for Distributed Space
Systems (GRAND) to validate RF-based navigation techniques, and the Testbed for
Rendezvous and Optical Navigation (TRON) and Optical Stimulator (OS) to
validate vision-based methods. The test article for this work is an integrated
multi-modal GNC software stack for RPO and FF developed at SLAB. This paper
introduces the hybrid framework and summarizes calibration and error
characterization for the robotic twin. Then, the GNC stack's performance and
robustness is characterized using the integrated digital and robotic twinning
pipeline for a full-range RPO mission scenario in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO). The
results shown in the paper demonstrate consistency between digital and robotic
twins, validating the hybrid twinning pipeline as a reliable framework for
realistic assessment and verification of GNC systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a real-time, integrated musculoskeletal modeling framework using wearable sensors and OpenSimRT to overcome limitations of traditional systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of musculoskeletal modeling such as reliance on costly sensors, complex setups, and lack of integrated tools, hindering widespread adoption.

Method: The authors developed a real-time framework integrating OpenSimRT, ROS, and wearable sensors, tested on various movements combining inertial sensors and pressure insoles.

Result: The framework successfully described inverse kinematics for upper and lower body and estimated ankle dynamics and muscle activations during daily activities.

Conclusion: This framework demonstrates potential to enhance human movement analysis, benefiting rehabilitation, robotics, and exoskeleton design.

Abstract: Musculoskeletal modeling and simulations enable the accurate description and
analysis of the movement of biological systems with applications such as
rehabilitation assessment, prosthesis, and exoskeleton design. However, the
widespread usage of these techniques is limited by costly sensors,
laboratory-based setups, computationally demanding processes, and the use of
diverse software tools that often lack seamless integration. In this work, we
address these limitations by proposing an integrated, real-time framework for
musculoskeletal modeling and simulations that leverages OpenSimRT, the robotics
operating system (ROS), and wearable sensors. As a proof-of-concept, we
demonstrate that this framework can reasonably well describe inverse kinematics
of both lower and upper body using either inertial measurement units or
fiducial markers. Additionally, we show that it can effectively estimate
inverse dynamics of the ankle joint and muscle activations of major lower limb
muscles during daily activities, including walking, squatting and sit to stand,
stand to sit when combined with pressure insoles. We believe this work lays the
groundwork for further studies with more complex real-time and wearable
sensor-based human movement analysis systems and holds potential to advance
technologies in rehabilitation, robotics and exoskeleton designs.

*Yifan Zhang,Dianye Huang,Nassir Navab,Zhongliang Jiang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops a robotic approach using tactile signals to enhance intercostal ultrasound imaging by extracting rib structure data, achieving efficient and accurate scan path generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inter- and intra-operator variability in intercostal ultrasound imaging and overcoming challenges of acoustic noise and constrained acoustic window.

Method: Use tactile cues to generate sparse point clouds of rib structures, interpolate and register it to dense image-based clouds, and introduce tilt angle adjustments for improved visualization.

Result: Achieved high accuracy with Mean Nearest Neighbor Distance (3.41 mm), Hausdorff distance (3.65 mm), and low reconstruction errors (0.69 mm, 2.2 mm).

Conclusion: The method offers a promising approach for improving challenging intercostal ultrasound imaging, enhancing patient-specific scan path mapping and visualization accuracy.

Abstract: Medical ultrasound (US) imaging is widely used in clinical examinations due
to its portability, real-time capability, and radiation-free nature. To address
inter- and intra-operator variability, robotic ultrasound systems have gained
increasing attention. However, their application in challenging intercostal
imaging remains limited due to the lack of an effective scan path generation
method within the constrained acoustic window. To overcome this challenge, we
explore the potential of tactile cues for characterizing subcutaneous rib
structures as an alternative signal for ultrasound segmentation-free bone
surface point cloud extraction. Compared to 2D US images, 1D tactile-related
signals offer higher processing efficiency and are less susceptible to acoustic
noise and artifacts. By leveraging robotic tracking data, a sparse tactile
point cloud is generated through a few scans along the rib, mimicking human
palpation. To robustly map the scanning trajectory into the intercostal space,
the sparse tactile bone location point cloud is first interpolated to form a
denser representation. This refined point cloud is then registered to an
image-based dense bone surface point cloud, enabling accurate scan path mapping
for individual patients. Additionally, to ensure full coverage of the object of
interest, we introduce an automated tilt angle adjustment method to visualize
structures beneath the bone. To validate the proposed method, we conducted
comprehensive experiments on four distinct phantoms. The final scanning
waypoint mapping achieved Mean Nearest Neighbor Distance (MNND) and Hausdorff
distance (HD) errors of 3.41 mm and 3.65 mm, respectively, while the
reconstructed object beneath the bone had errors of 0.69 mm and 2.2 mm compared
to the CT ground truth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to tackle collision avoidance challenges in robotic applications that involve uncertainty due to kinematic constraints and noisy observations.

Method: The proposed method integrates MPPI with probabilistic Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance, using Second-Order Cone Programming for incorporating safety constraints directly.

Result: Through extensive simulations, the approach outperformed state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating high success rates in densely populated environments, and showed practical applicability in Gazebo simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively ensures collision-free navigation under uncertainty, showcasing superior performance and practical applicability.

Abstract: Decentralized multi-agent navigation under uncertainty is a complex task that
arises in numerous robotic applications. It requires collision avoidance
strategies that account for both kinematic constraints, sensing and action
execution noise. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates the
Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) with a probabilistic adaptation of
Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance. Our method ensures safe and efficient
multi-agent navigation by incorporating probabilistic safety constraints
directly into the MPPI sampling process via a Second-Order Cone Programming
formulation. This approach enables agents to operate independently using local
noisy observations while maintaining safety guarantees. We validate our
algorithm through extensive simulations with differential-drive robots and
benchmark it against state-of-the-art methods, including ORCA-DD and B-UAVC.
Results demonstrate that our approach outperforms them while achieving high
success rates, even in densely populated environments. Additionally, validation
in the Gazebo simulator confirms its practical applicability to robotic
platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the difficulties faced in marine robotic operations, including limited visibility and unpredictable underwater conditions, emphasizing the need for advanced autonomy and human oversight.

Method: The study utilizes a RAG-powered large language model, enhanced by knowledge graph data and domain taxonomy, to demonstrate autonomy in multi-agent decision-making and human-robot interaction.

Result: The approach achieves 100% mission validation and behavior completeness, while ablation studies highlight the importance of structured knowledge to mitigate hallucinations in decision-making.

Conclusion: Integrating structured knowledge directly into large language models fosters effective autonomy and enhances human-robot collaboration in complex marine environments.

Abstract: Robotic platforms have become essential for marine operations by providing
regular and continuous access to offshore assets, such as underwater
infrastructure inspection, environmental monitoring, and resource exploration.
However, the complex and dynamic nature of underwater environments,
characterized by limited visibility, unpredictable currents, and communication
constraints, presents significant challenges that demand advanced autonomy
while ensuring operator trust and oversight. Central to addressing these
challenges are knowledge representation and reasoning techniques, particularly
knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, that enable
robots to efficiently structure, retrieve, and interpret complex environmental
data. These capabilities empower robotic agents to reason, adapt, and respond
effectively to changing conditions. The primary goal of this work is to
demonstrate both multi-agent autonomy and shared autonomy, where multiple
robotic agents operate independently while remaining connected to a human
supervisor. We show how a RAG-powered large language model, augmented with
knowledge graph data and domain taxonomy, enables autonomous multi-agent
decision-making and facilitates seamless human-robot interaction, resulting in
100\% mission validation and behavior completeness. Finally, ablation studies
reveal that without structured knowledge from the graph and/or taxonomy, the
LLM is prone to hallucinations, which can compromise decision quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to expand the usability of quadrupedal robots by enabling their front legs to interact with the environment while maintaining locomotion efficiency, aiming to mitigate trade-offs between using legs as manipulators and system complexity from mounted arms.

Method: A risk-adaptive distributional Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework was employed, dynamically adjusting the risk preference during training based on the uncertainty of the return, measured by the coefficient of variation of the return distribution.

Result: The method achieved superior performance over baselines in simulation and was successfully deployed on a Unitree Go2 robot, enabling tasks such as cart pushing, obstacle probing, and payload transport, while demonstrating robustness against challenging dynamics and disturbances.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that introducing bipedalism and adaptive RL mechanisms to quadrupedal robots enhances their versatility and robustness for both simulation and real-world applications.

Abstract: Loco-manipulation of quadrupedal robots has broadened robotic applications,
but using legs as manipulators often compromises locomotion, while mounting
arms complicates the system. To mitigate this issue, we introduce bipedalism
for quadrupedal robots, thus freeing the front legs for versatile interactions
with the environment. We propose a risk-adaptive distributional Reinforcement
Learning (RL) framework designed for quadrupedal robots walking on their hind
legs, balancing worst-case conservativeness with optimal performance in this
inherently unstable task. During training, the adaptive risk preference is
dynamically adjusted based on the uncertainty of the return, measured by the
coefficient of variation of the estimated return distribution. Extensive
experiments in simulation show our method's superior performance over
baselines. Real-world deployment on a Unitree Go2 robot further demonstrates
the versatility of our policy, enabling tasks like cart pushing, obstacle
probing, and payload transport, while showcasing robustness against challenging
dynamics and external disturbances.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the black-box nature of existing deep learning models in autonomous racing, a critical issue for safety and robustness.

Method: MS-NN-steer integrates prior knowledge of nonlinear vehicle dynamics into a neural network architecture for autonomous steering control.

Result: Experimental validation using data from the Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League shows MS-NN-steer achieves better accuracy and robustness, generalizing well with limited training data, and surpasses the performance of the previous winning team’s steering controller.

Conclusion: MS-NN-steer offers an effective, reliable, and interpretable solution for autonomous vehicle steering control in racing applications, with its performance validated on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Autonomous racing has gained increasing attention in recent years, as a safe
environment to accelerate the development of motion planning and control
methods for autonomous driving. Deep learning models, predominantly based on
neural networks (NNs), have demonstrated significant potential in modeling the
vehicle dynamics and in performing various tasks in autonomous driving.
However, their black-box nature is critical in the context of autonomous
racing, where safety and robustness demand a thorough understanding of the
decision-making algorithms. To address this challenge, this paper proposes
MS-NN-steer, a new Model-Structured Neural Network for vehicle steering
control, integrating the prior knowledge of the nonlinear vehicle dynamics into
the neural architecture. The proposed controller is validated using real-world
data from the Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League (A2RL) competition, with
full-scale autonomous race cars. In comparison with general-purpose NNs,
MS-NN-steer is shown to achieve better accuracy and generalization with small
training datasets, while being less sensitive to the weights' initialization.
Also, MS-NN-steer outperforms the steering controller used by the A2RL winning
team. Our implementation is available open-source in a GitHub repository.

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework (BuddyImitation) enabling agents with different morphologies to learn physical interaction behaviors from human demonstrations using an Embedded Interaction Graph (EIG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of enabling agents with varying embodiments to learn complex physical interaction behaviors directly from human demonstrations, overcoming limitations of handcrafted objectives and requiring morphological similarity.

Method: The Embedded Interaction Graph (EIG) is introduced as a compact and transferable representation of interaction dynamics, which is then used as an imitation objective to train agents in physics-based simulations.

Result: The method is successfully demonstrated across a range of morphologically diverse agents (humans, quadrupeds, etc.) and interaction scenarios (sparring, dancing, etc.), showcasing its ability to generate meaningful and feasible interactions.

Conclusion: BuddyImitation shows promise in enabling coordinated interaction behaviors across agents with differing embodiments using cross-embodiment interaction learning.

Abstract: Learning physical interaction skills, such as dancing, handshaking, or
sparring, remains a fundamental challenge for agents operating in human
environments, particularly when the agent's morphology differs significantly
from that of the demonstrator. Existing approaches often rely on handcrafted
objectives or morphological similarity, limiting their capacity for
generalization. Here, we introduce a framework that enables agents with diverse
embodiments to learn wholebbody interaction behaviors directly from human
demonstrations. The framework extracts a compact, transferable representation
of interaction dynamics, called the Embedded Interaction Graph (EIG), which
captures key spatiotemporal relationships between the interacting agents. This
graph is then used as an imitation objective to train control policies in
physics-based simulations, allowing the agent to generate motions that are both
semantically meaningful and physically feasible. We demonstrate BuddyImitation
on multiple agents, such as humans, quadrupedal robots with manipulators, or
mobile manipulators and various interaction scenarios, including sparring,
handshaking, rock-paper-scissors, or dancing. Our results demonstrate a
promising path toward coordinated behaviors across morphologically distinct
characters via cross embodiment interaction learning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for adaptive control in robotics, proposing an LLM-guided adaptive compensator. Results show improved performance over traditional adaptive methods and demonstrate LLMs' generalizability and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the limitations of current research using LLMs in feedback controller design, which often focuses on simplified systems and lacks real-world applicability. It aims to explore the potential of LLMs in adaptive control, a crucial subfield in automatic control.

Method: The authors propose an LLM-guided adaptive compensator framework inspired by model reference adaptive control (MRAC). This framework enables adaptivity by prompting the LLM with differences between unknown and reference systems, allowing the LLM to design a compensator to align the systems' responses. Experiments compare five methods across robots in various environments.

Result: The LLM-guided adaptive compensator outperforms traditional adaptive controllers and simplifies reasoning complexity compared to an LLM-guided adaptive controller. It shows strong generalizability, adaptability, and robustness in both simulated and real environments, supported by Lyapunov-based analysis.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential for LLMs in structured and practical adaptive controller design, transforming it into a reasoning task. The proposed compensator improves performance and reduces complexity, paving the way for broader LLM applications in automatic control.

Abstract: With rapid advances in code generation, reasoning, and problem-solving, Large
Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in robotics. Most existing work
focuses on high-level tasks such as task decomposition. A few studies have
explored the use of LLMs in feedback controller design; however, these efforts
are restricted to overly simplified systems, fixed-structure gain tuning, and
lack real-world validation. To further investigate LLMs in automatic control,
this work targets a key subfield: adaptive control. Inspired by the framework
of model reference adaptive control (MRAC), we propose an LLM-guided adaptive
compensator framework that avoids designing controllers from scratch. Instead,
the LLMs are prompted using the discrepancies between an unknown system and a
reference system to design a compensator that aligns the response of the
unknown system with that of the reference, thereby achieving adaptivity.
Experiments evaluate five methods: LLM-guided adaptive compensator, LLM-guided
adaptive controller, indirect adaptive control, learning-based adaptive
control, and MRAC, on soft and humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world
environments. Results show that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator outperforms
traditional adaptive controllers and significantly reduces reasoning complexity
compared to the LLM-guided adaptive controller. The Lyapunov-based analysis and
reasoning-path inspection demonstrate that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator
enables a more structured design process by transforming mathematical
derivation into a reasoning task, while exhibiting strong generalizability,
adaptability, and robustness. This study opens a new direction for applying
LLMs in the field of automatic control, offering greater deployability and
practicality compared to vision-language models.

TL;DR: Uni-Mapper is a system that robustly merges multi-modal LiDAR maps, addressing challenges from dynamic environments and different sensor types using dynamic object removal and pose graph optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable and robust robot operation across multiple sessions and environments, while overcoming challenges introduced by varying LiDAR types and dynamic changes.

Method: The framework employs dynamic object removal using temporal occupancy inconsistencies, integrates a LiDAR global descriptor for place recognition, and performs centralized anchor-node pose graph optimizations for map alignment.

Result: Uni-Mapper demonstrates superior performance in loop detection across sensor types, accurate map alignment, and robust mapping in dynamic real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Uni-Mapper successfully unifies multi-modal LiDAR maps with high accuracy in dynamic settings, advancing scalable and collaborative robotic operations.

Abstract: The unification of disparate maps is crucial for enabling scalable robot
operation across multiple sessions and collaborative multi-robot scenarios.
However, achieving a unified map robust to sensor modalities and dynamic
environments remains a challenging problem. Variations in LiDAR types and
dynamic elements lead to differences in point cloud distribution and scene
consistency, hindering reliable descriptor generation and loop closure
detection essential for accurate map alignment. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Uni-Mapper, a dynamic-aware 3D point cloud map merging
framework for multi-modal LiDAR systems. It comprises dynamic object removal,
dynamic-aware loop closure, and multi-modal LiDAR map merging modules. A
voxel-wise free space hash map is built in a coarse-to-fine manner to identify
and reject dynamic objects via temporal occupancy inconsistencies. The removal
module is integrated with a LiDAR global descriptor, which encodes preserved
static local features to ensure robust place recognition in dynamic
environments. In the final stage, multiple pose graph optimizations are
conducted for both intra-session and inter-map loop closures. We adopt a
centralized anchor-node strategy to mitigate intra-session drift errors during
map merging. In the final stage, centralized anchor-node-based pose graph
optimization is performed to address intra- and inter-map loop closures for
globally consistent map merging. Our framework is evaluated on diverse
real-world datasets with dynamic objects and heterogeneous LiDARs, showing
superior performance in loop detection across sensor modalities, robust mapping
in dynamic environments, and accurate multi-map alignment over existing
methods. Project Page: https://sparolab.github.io/research/uni_mapper.

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods for detecting navigable surfaces in truss structures to aid autonomous robot navigation, comparing analytical algorithms and deep learning models on 3D point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to reduce costs and hazards in inspecting and maintaining reticular structures like bridges and airports, often requiring human intervention.

Method: The study explores binary segmentation of navigable surfaces using 3D point clouds through two approaches: custom analytical algorithms (e.g., eigendecomposition of planar patches) and advanced deep learning models (PointNet, PointNet++, MinkUNet34C, and PointTransformerV3).

Result: Both methods deliver effective segmentation, with the analytical algorithm offering ease of parameter tuning and comparable performance, while PointTransformerV3 achieves the highest segmentation accuracy at approximately 97% mIoU.

Conclusion: The study underscores the potential of combining analytical and deep learning methods for autonomous navigation in truss environments, balancing computational efficiency and segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Reticular structures form the backbone of major infrastructure like bridges,
pylons, and airports, but their inspection and maintenance are costly and
hazardous, often requiring human intervention. While prior research has focused
on fault detection via images or robotic platform design, the autonomous
navigation of robots within these structures is less explored. This study
addresses that gap by proposing methods to detect navigable surfaces in truss
structures, enhancing the autonomy of climbing robots. The paper introduces
several approaches for binary segmentation of navigable surfaces versus
background from 3D point clouds of metallic trusses. These methods fall into
two categories: analytical algorithms and deep learning models. The analytical
approach features a custom algorithm that segments structures by analyzing the
eigendecomposition of planar patches in the point cloud. In parallel, advanced
deep learning models PointNet, PointNet++, MinkUNet34C, and PointTransformerV3
are trained and evaluated for the same task. Comparative analysis shows that
the analytical algorithm offers easier parameter tuning and performance
comparable to deep learning models, which, while more computationally
intensive, excel in segmentation accuracy. Notably, PointTransformerV3 achieves
a Mean Intersection Over Union (mIoU) of about 97%. The study demonstrates the
promise of both analytical and deep learning methods for improving autonomous
navigation in complex truss environments. The results highlight the trade-offs
between computational efficiency and segmentation performance, providing
valuable guidance for future research and practical applications in autonomous
infrastructure inspection and maintenance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches primarily focus on high-level plan learning from human demonstrations but face limitations due to reliance on pre-defined motion primitives for executing tasks.

Method: The method, FMimic, uses foundation models to learn generalizable skills at fine-grained action levels directly from a small number of human videos.

Result: FMimic delivers strong performance, significantly outperforming other methods in experiments with human videos, high-precision tasks, long-horizon tasks, and real-world manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: FMimic demonstrates the potential of foundation models like Vision Language Models to enhance robotic skill learning, effectively reducing dependency on motion primitives and achieving substantial improvements in real-world applications.

Abstract: Visual imitation learning (VIL) provides an efficient and intuitive strategy
for robotic systems to acquire novel skills. Recent advancements in foundation
models, particularly Vision Language Models (VLMs), have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in visual and linguistic reasoning for VIL tasks.
Despite this progress, existing approaches primarily utilize these models for
learning high-level plans from human demonstrations, relying on pre-defined
motion primitives for executing physical interactions, which remains a major
bottleneck for robotic systems. In this work, we present FMimic, a novel
paradigm that harnesses foundation models to directly learn generalizable
skills at even fine-grained action levels, using only a limited number of human
videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FMimic delivers strong
performance with a single human video, and significantly outperforms all other
methods with five videos. Furthermore, our method exhibits significant
improvements of over 39% and 29% in RLBench multi-task experiments and
real-world manipulation tasks, respectively, and exceeds baselines by more than
34% in high-precision tasks and 47% in long-horizon tasks.

*Vinil Polepalli*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LanternNet is a robotic system using AI for scalable detection and suppression of spotted lanternfly (SLF), showing significant reductions in pest populations and improved tree health during field trials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the limitations of current SLF suppression approaches like pesticides and egg scraping, which are labor-intensive, hazardous, and inefficient for long-term control.

Method: LanternNet employs a central hub with YOLOv8 computer vision for SLF identification, along with three robotic spokes handling pest neutralization, monitoring, and site navigation.

Result: Field tests showed significant decreases in SLF populations, improved tree health indicators, and scalability benefits over traditional pest suppression methods.

Conclusion: LanternNet integrates robotics and AI for effective invasive species management, offering ecological and cost advantages over conventional methods, with potential adaptability to other species.

Abstract: The invasive spotted lanternfly (SLF) poses a significant threat to
agriculture and ecosystems, causing widespread damage. Current control methods,
such as egg scraping, pesticides, and quarantines, prove labor-intensive,
environmentally hazardous, and inadequate for long-term SLF suppression. This
research introduces LanternNet, a novel autonomous robotic Hub-and-Spoke system
designed for scalable detection and suppression of SLF populations. A central,
tree-mimicking hub utilizes a YOLOv8 computer vision model for precise SLF
identification. Three specialized robotic spokes perform targeted tasks: pest
neutralization, environmental monitoring, and navigation/mapping. Field
deployment across multiple infested sites over 5 weeks demonstrated
LanternNet's efficacy. Quantitative analysis revealed significant reductions (p
< 0.01, paired t-tests) in SLF populations and corresponding improvements in
tree health indicators across the majority of test sites. Compared to
conventional methods, LanternNet offers substantial cost advantages and
improved scalability. Furthermore, the system's adaptability for enhanced
autonomy and targeting of other invasive species presents significant potential
for broader ecological impact. LanternNet demonstrates the transformative
potential of integrating robotics and AI for advanced invasive species
management and improved environmental outcomes.

*Mihai Pomarlan,Stefano De Giorgis,Rachel Ringe,Maria M. Hedblom,Nikolaos Tsiogkas*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neurosymbolic modular architecture for robotics, combining neural components, image processing, and symbolic reasoning to enable situational awareness and learning in natural environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address key challenges in situational awareness for artificial agents, such as spatial awareness, object affordance detection, and dynamic adaptability, particularly focusing on identifying and monitoring environment elements relevant to objectives.

Method: A neurosymbolic system integrates neural object recognition, image processing (e.g., optical flow), and symbolic reasoning using embodied cognition and ontologies. This setup facilitates dynamic querying, learning, and reasoning for object parts and capabilities.

Result: The agent can autonomously discover new object concepts, acquire training data, and adapt perception to achieve tasks. Simulations showcase the ability to learn and operationalize object part recognition, like understanding hooks and handles in a support relation.

Conclusion: The proposed system advances situationally-aware robotics by systematically expanding knowledge through observation, combining deep reasoning with symbolic and neural techniques to increase task adaptability and complexity handling.

Abstract: Situationally-aware artificial agents operating with competence in natural
environments face several challenges: spatial awareness, object affordance
detection, dynamic changes and unpredictability. A critical challenge is the
agent's ability to identify and monitor environmental elements pertinent to its
objectives. Our research introduces a neurosymbolic modular architecture for
reactive robotics. Our system combines a neural component performing object
recognition over the environment and image processing techniques such as
optical flow, with symbolic representation and reasoning. The reasoning system
is grounded in the embodied cognition paradigm, via integrating image schematic
knowledge in an ontological structure. The ontology is operatively used to
create queries for the perception system, decide on actions, and infer
entities' capabilities derived from perceptual data. The combination of
reasoning and image processing allows the agent to focus its perception for
normal operation as well as discover new concepts for parts of objects involved
in particular interactions. The discovered concepts allow the robot to
autonomously acquire training data and adjust its subsymbolic perception to
recognize the parts, as well as making planning for more complex tasks feasible
by focusing search on those relevant object parts. We demonstrate our approach
in a simulated world, in which an agent learns to recognize parts of objects
involved in support relations. While the agent has no concept of handle
initially, by observing examples of supported objects hanging from a hook it
learns to recognize the parts involved in establishing support and becomes able
to plan the establishment/destruction of the support relation. This underscores
the agent's capability to expand its knowledge through observation in a
systematic way, and illustrates the potential of combining deep reasoning
[...].

### [506] [Free Energy-Inspired Cognitive Risk Integration for AV Navigation in Pedestrian-Rich Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20850)
*Meiting Dang,Yanping Wu,Yafei Wang,Dezong Zhao,David Flynn,Chongfeng Wei*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops a framework to improve autonomous vehicle-interactions with pedestrians using cognitive modeling based on the Free Energy Principle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in achieving human-like prediction and decision-making when AVs interact with pedestrians in complex, multi-agent environments.

Method: A novel framework integrates cognitive uncertainty and physical risk into pedestrian and AV models. Pedestrians follow a Cognitive-Risk Social Force Model, and AVs utilize a Graph Convolutional Network with Soft Actor-Critic architecture.

Result: Simulation results show enhanced safety, efficiency, and smoothness of AV navigation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework models realistic interaction between AVs and pedestrians, addressing key limitations of prior approaches and improving navigation outcomes.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous vehicle (AV) behavior planning have shown
impressive social interaction capabilities when interacting with other road
users. However, achieving human-like prediction and decision-making in
interactions with vulnerable road users remains a key challenge in complex
multi-agent interactive environments. Existing research focuses primarily on
crowd navigation for small mobile robots, which cannot be directly applied to
AVs due to inherent differences in their decision-making strategies and dynamic
boundaries. Moreover, pedestrians in these multi-agent simulations follow fixed
behavior patterns that cannot dynamically respond to AV actions. To overcome
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework for modeling
interactions between the AV and multiple pedestrians. In this framework, a
cognitive process modeling approach inspired by the Free Energy Principle is
integrated into both the AV and pedestrian models to simulate more realistic
interaction dynamics. Specifically, the proposed pedestrian Cognitive-Risk
Social Force Model adjusts goal-directed and repulsive forces using a fused
measure of cognitive uncertainty and physical risk to produce human-like
trajectories. Meanwhile, the AV leverages this fused risk to construct a
dynamic, risk-aware adjacency matrix for a Graph Convolutional Network within a
Soft Actor-Critic architecture, allowing it to make more reasonable and
informed decisions. Simulation results indicate that our proposed framework
effectively improves safety, efficiency, and smoothness of AV navigation
compared to the state-of-the-art method.

*Marco Faroni,Carlo Odesco,Andrea Zanchettin,Paolo Rocco*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm for robotics tasks like liquid pouring, improving planning reliability and success rates under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately handling complex robotic tasks like liquid pouring is challenging due to epistemic uncertainty and the sim-to-real gap.

Method: The authors present a novel MCTS strategy incorporating model uncertainty estimates to bias actions toward lower predicted uncertainty.

Result: The proposed method shows improved success rates in liquid pouring tasks compared to traditional methods, even with minimal training data.

Conclusion: Integrating model uncertainty into planning algorithms can significantly enhance robustness and decision-making in robotics systems.

Abstract: Physics-based simulations and learning-based models are vital for complex
robotics tasks like deformable object manipulation and liquid handling.
However, these models often struggle with accuracy due to epistemic uncertainty
or the sim-to-real gap. For instance, accurately pouring liquid from one
container to another poses challenges, particularly when models are trained on
limited demonstrations and may perform poorly in novel situations. This paper
proposes an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm designed
to mitigate these inaccuracies. By incorporating estimates of model
uncertainty, the proposed MCTS strategy biases the search towards actions with
lower predicted uncertainty. This approach enhances the reliability of planning
under uncertain conditions. Applied to a liquid pouring task, our method
demonstrates improved success rates even with models trained on minimal data,
outperforming traditional methods and showcasing its potential for robust
decision-making in robotics.

*Elena Merlo,Marta Lagomarsino,Arash Ajoudani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method combining video-based robotic programming with human inputs via natural language to improve execution plans generated by a Large Language Model (LLM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Observational learning for robotics faces inefficiencies in scalability and error correction, especially with single visual demonstrations.

Method: The system enhances robot execution plans derived from RGB video by integrating user feedback and leveraging LLM reasoning to adjust the plans for robustness and accuracy.

Result: Experiments validated the framework's intuitiveness and effectiveness in improving vision-derived robotic plans and correcting errors without needing additional demonstrations.

Conclusion: Integrating human input via natural language and LLM reasoning makes robotic programming more accessible and robust for non-experts, allowing interactive plan refinement and error correction.

Abstract: To facilitate the wider adoption of robotics, accessible programming tools
are required for non-experts. Observational learning enables intuitive human
skills transfer through hands-on demonstrations, but relying solely on visual
input can be inefficient in terms of scalability and failure mitigation,
especially when based on a single demonstration. This paper presents a
human-in-the-loop method for enhancing the robot execution plan, automatically
generated based on a single RGB video, with natural language input to a Large
Language Model (LLM). By including user-specified goals or critical task
aspects and exploiting the LLM common-sense reasoning, the system adjusts the
vision-based plan to prevent potential failures and adapts it based on the
received instructions. Experiments demonstrated the framework intuitiveness and
effectiveness in correcting vision-derived errors and adapting plans without
requiring additional demonstrations. Moreover, interactive plan refinement and
hallucination corrections promoted system robustness.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a vision-based hybrid navigation system for mobile robots combining deep learning and classical planning methods using topological graphs for improved scalability and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end deep learning systems for robot navigation, while flexible, face challenges such as data demands and poor interpretability. The work aims to address these obstacles for practical usability.

Method: A hierarchical system combining model predictive control, traversability estimation, visual place recognition, and pose estimation is proposed. Topological graphs are used for environmental representation.

Result: The approach was successfully tested in extensive real-world experiments, demonstrating its efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid navigation framework offers scalability, interpretability, and practical efficiency over purely data-driven models.

Abstract: This work proposes a novel hybrid approach for vision-only navigation of
mobile robots, which combines advances of both deep learning approaches and
classical model-based planning algorithms. Today, purely data-driven end-to-end
models are dominant solutions to this problem. Despite advantages such as
flexibility and adaptability, the requirement of a large amount of training
data and limited interpretability are the main bottlenecks for their practical
applications. To address these limitations, we propose a hierarchical system
that utilizes recent advances in model predictive control, traversability
estimation, visual place recognition, and pose estimation, employing
topological graphs as a representation of the target environment. Using such a
combination, we provide a scalable system with a higher level of
interpretability compared to end-to-end approaches. Extensive real-world
experiments show the efficiency of the proposed method.

### [510] [AccessGuru: Leveraging LLMs to Detect and Correct Web Accessibility Violations in HTML Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19549)
*Nadeen Fathallah,Daniel Hernández,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AccessGuru uses a novel taxonomy and combines accessibility tools with LLMs to automatically detect and correct various Web accessibility violations, achieving an 84% reduction in violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web pages often fail to meet accessibility standards, excluding users with diverse abilities. Addressing this deficiency requires expertise and manual effort, necessitating automated solutions to promote inclusivity.

Method: A novel taxonomy categorizing violations into Syntactic, Semantic, and Layout types was developed. AccessGuru integrates existing accessibility tools and LLMs, using taxonomy-driven prompting strategies for detection and correction.

Result: AccessGuru achieves up to 84% average decrease in accessibility violation scores, significantly outperforming prior methods which achieved up to 50%.

Conclusion: AccessGuru provides an effective automated solution for detecting and correcting Web accessibility issues, leveraging innovative classifications and combining tools with advanced language models to enhance inclusiveness.

Abstract: The vast majority of Web pages fail to comply with established Web
accessibility guidelines, excluding a range of users with diverse abilities
from interacting with their content. Making Web pages accessible to all users
requires dedicated expertise and additional manual efforts from Web page
providers. To lower their efforts and promote inclusiveness, we aim to
automatically detect and correct Web accessibility violations in HTML code.
While previous work has made progress in detecting certain types of
accessibility violations, the problem of automatically detecting and correcting
accessibility violations remains an open challenge that we address. We
introduce a novel taxonomy classifying Web accessibility violations into three
key categories - Syntactic, Semantic, and Layout. This taxonomy provides a
structured foundation for developing our detection and correction method and
redefining evaluation metrics. We propose a novel method, AccessGuru, which
combines existing accessibility testing tools and Large Language Models (LLMs)
to detect violations and applies taxonomy-driven prompting strategies to
correct all three categories. To evaluate these capabilities, we develop a
benchmark of real-world Web accessibility violations. Our benchmark quantifies
syntactic and layout compliance and judges semantic accuracy through
comparative analysis with human expert corrections. Evaluation against our
benchmark shows that AccessGuru achieves up to 84% average violation score
decrease, significantly outperforming prior methods that achieve at most 50%.

### [511] [LastMerge: A language-agnostic structured tool for code integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19687)
*Joao Pedro Duarte,Paulo Borba,Guilherme Cavalcanti*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces LastMerge, a generic structured merge tool aimed at improving merge accuracy across various programming languages while reducing development effort. It evaluates LastMerge and another tool, Mergiraf, in comparison to language-specific tools. Results show that the generic tools can achieve comparable accuracy and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structured AST-based merge tools offer higher accuracy but are underused due to their language-specific nature and high cost. The authors aim to make structured merging accessible and broadly applicable by creating a configurable and generic structured merge tool.

Method: The study developed a generic structured merge tool named LastMerge and compared its performance against both language-specific (jDime, Spork) and generic tools (Mergiraf). Experiments involved replaying merge scenarios from a dataset to assess runtime, divergences, and merge accuracy.

Result: LastMerge reported 15% fewer false positives than jDime, while Mergiraf missed 42% fewer false negatives than Spork. Additionally, the runtime of the generic tools was similar to that of the language-specific implementations. There was a 10% difference rate between Java-specific and generic tools mostly due to implementation details.

Conclusion: Generic structured merge tools like LastMerge and Mergiraf can achieve comparable results to language-specific tools. They represent a promising alternative, potentially encouraging industry adoption of structured merging.

Abstract: Unstructured line-based merge tools are widely used in practice. Structured
AST-based merge tools show significantly improved merge accuracy, but are
rarely used in practice because they are language specific and costly,
consequently not being available for many programming languages. To improve
merge accuracy for a wide range of languages, we propose LastMerge, a generic
structured merge tool that can be configured through a thin interface that
significantly reduces the effort of supporting structured merge. To understand
the impact that generic structured merge might have on merge accuracy and
performance, we run an experiment with four structured merge tools: two Java
specific tools, jDime and Spork, and their generic counterparts, respectively
LastMerge and Mergiraf. Using each tool, we replay merge scenarios from a
significant dataset, and collect data on runtime, behavioral divergences, and
merge accuracy. Our results show no evidence that generic structured merge
significantly impacts merge accuracy. Although we observe a difference rate of
approximately 10% between the Java specific tools and their generic
counterparts, most of the differences stem from implementation details and
could be avoided. We find that LastMerge reports 15% fewer false positives than
jDime while Mergiraf misses 42% fewer false negatives than Spork. Both generic
tools exhibit comparable runtime performance to the state of the art language
specific implementations. These results suggest that generic structured merge
tools can effectively replace language-specific ones, paving the way for
broader adoption of structured merge in industry.

*Feifei Niu,Junqian Shao,Christoph Mayr-Dorn,Liguo Huang,Wesley K. G. Assunção,Chuanyi Li,Jidong Ge,Alexander Egyed*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper addresses the overlooked effect of code refactoring on just-in-time defect prediction (JIT-DP) and proposes improvements using the Code chAnge Tactics (CAT) analysis, which enhances model performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the largely ignored role of code refactoring in the evaluation and methodology of JIT-DP models, given its potential to introduce biases and hinder prediction accuracy.

Method: The authors developed a Code chAnge Tactics (CAT) analysis approach to identify and categorize the effects of refactoring and its propagation, improving the labeling accuracy of the JIT-Defects4J dataset.

Result: Using CAT analysis, labeling accuracy increased by 13.7%, while integrating refactoring information significantly improved baseline model performance, achieving up to 43.2% improvement in recall and 32.5% in F1-score.

Conclusion: Incorporating code refactoring information in JIT-DP enhances prediction accuracy and mitigates biases, and the proposed CAT method provides a general tool for analyzing refactoring in software maintenance.

Abstract: Just-in-time defect prediction (JIT-DP) aims to predict the likelihood of
code changes resulting in software defects at an early stage. Although code
change metrics and semantic features have enhanced prediction accuracy, prior
research has largely ignored code refactoring during both the evaluation and
methodology phases, despite its prevalence. Refactoring and its propagation
often tangle with bug-fixing and bug-inducing changes within the same commit
and statement. Neglecting refactoring can introduce bias into the learning and
evaluation of JIT-DP models. To address this gap, we investigate the impact of
refactoring and its propagation on six state-of-the-art JIT-DP approaches. We
propose Code chAnge Tactics (CAT) analysis to categorize code refactoring and
its propagation, which improves labeling accuracy in the JIT-Defects4J dataset
by 13.7%. Our experiments reveal that failing to consider refactoring
information in the dataset can diminish the performance of models, particularly
semantic-based models, by 18.6% and 37.3% in F1-score. Additionally, we propose
integrating refactoring information to enhance six baseline approaches,
resulting in overall improvements in recall and F1-score, with increases of up
to 43.2% and 32.5%, respectively. Our research underscores the importance of
incorporating refactoring information in the methodology and evaluation of
JIT-DP. Furthermore, our CAT has broad applicability in analyzing refactoring
and its propagation for software maintenance.

### [513] [LLM-Based Repair of Static Nullability Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20674)
*Nima Karimipour,Michael Pradel,Martin Kellogg,Manu Sridharan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces NullRepair, a tool that utilizes large language models (LLMs) in a structured workflow to address nullability errors in Java projects. It resolves errors effectively while maintaining program correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually resolving nullability errors remaining after static analysis is tedious and error-prone. This motivates the need for an automated and reliable solution that integrates deep understanding of codebase context.

Method: NullRepair integrates LLMs into a structured approach based on a flowchart derived from real-world error analysis. It uses static analysis to define safe/unsafe regions and contextualizes prompts with error-free examples. Edits are iteratively generated, incorporating project-wide context.

Result: NullRepair was evaluated on 12 Java projects and resolved 72% of nullability errors left after applying a state-of-the-art annotation inference. It largely preserved program semantics, with all or nearly all unit tests passing in evaluated projects.

Conclusion: NullRepair provides a robust, automated solution that effectively and safely resolves nullability errors, demonstrating its potential for practical deployment in large Java projects.

Abstract: Modern Java projects increasingly adopt static analysis tools that prevent
null-pointer exceptions by treating nullness as a type property. However,
integrating such tools into large, existing codebases remains a significant
challenge. While annotation inference can eliminate many errors automatically,
a subset of residual errors -- typically a mix of real bugs and false positives
-- often persist and can only be resolved via code changes. Manually addressing
these errors is tedious and error-prone. Large language models (LLMs) offer a
promising path toward automating these repairs, but naively-prompted LLMs often
generate incorrect, contextually-inappropriate edits. Resolving a nullability
error demands a deep understanding of how a symbol is used across the codebase,
often spanning methods, classes, and packages. We present NullRepair, a system
that integrates LLMs into a structured workflow for resolving the errors from a
nullability checker. NullRepair's decision process follows a flowchart derived
from manual analysis of 200 real-world errors. It leverages static analysis to
identify safe and unsafe usage regions of symbols, using error-free usage
examples to contextualize model prompts. Patches are generated through an
iterative interaction with the LLM that incorporates project-wide context and
decision logic. Our evaluation on 12 real-world Java projects shows that
NullRepair resolves an average of 72% of the errors that remain after applying
a state-of-the-art annotation inference technique. Unlike a naively-prompted
LLM, NullRepair also largely preserves program semantics, with all unit tests
passing in 10/12 projects after applying every edit proposed by NullRepair, and
98% or more tests passing in the remaining two projects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of modern software systems requires an integrated approach to address reliability alongside safety and security concerns.

Method: The authors analyze industry metrics for reliability prediction, identify threats to software reliability, and develop a threat estimation framework combining safety and security dimensions.

Result: The integration of reliability metrics with safety and security considerations is shown to enhance system robustness.

Conclusion: The study offers actionable guidelines to refine reliability prediction models and address multifaceted challenges within software safety and security contexts.

Abstract: Reliability prediction is crucial for ensuring the safety and security of
software systems, especially in the context of industry practices. While
various metrics and measurements are employed to assess software reliability,
the complexity of modern systems necessitates a deeper understanding of how
these metrics interact with security and safety concerns. This paper explores
the interplay between software reliability, safety, and security, offering a
comprehensive analysis of key metrics and measurement techniques used in the
industry for reliability prediction. We identify critical threats to software
reliability and provide a threat estimation framework that incorporates both
safety and security aspects. Our findings suggest that integrating reliability
metrics with safety and security considerations can enhance the robustness of
software systems. Furthermore, we propose a set of actionable guidelines for
practitioners to improve their reliability prediction models while
simultaneously addressing the security and safety challenges of contemporary
software applications.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper focuses on introducing and exploring Ethically Sourced Code Generation (ES-CodeGen) by reviewing literature and surveying practitioners to establish a taxonomy and dimensions associated with ethical practices in AI-based code generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ethical concerns (like unclear licensing and privacy) in the development and deployment of code generation models.

Method: The authors performed a two-phase literature review (803 papers examined, 71 identified as relevant) and surveyed 32 practitioners to build and refine a taxonomy for ES-CodeGen.

Result: The research identified 11 dimensions of ES-CodeGen, with an added emphasis on code quality, based on practitioner feedback. They also outlined the consequences, artifacts, and stages relevant to ES-CodeGen.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of addressing overlooked social dimensions and ethical issues, and it demonstrates the potential of surveys to enhance practitioners' understanding of ES-CodeGen.

Abstract: Several code generation models have been proposed to help reduce time and
effort in solving software-related tasks. To ensure responsible AI, there are
growing interests over various ethical issues (e.g., unclear licensing,
privacy, fairness, and environment impact). These studies have the overarching
goal of ensuring ethically sourced generation, which has gained growing
attentions in speech synthesis and image generation. In this paper, we
introduce the novel notion of Ethically Sourced Code Generation (ES-CodeGen) to
refer to managing all processes involved in code generation model development
from data collection to post-deployment via ethical and sustainable practices.
To build a taxonomy of ES-CodeGen, we perform a two-phase literature review
where we read 803 papers across various domains and specific to AI-based code
generation. We identified 71 relevant papers with 10 initial dimensions of
ES-CodeGen. To refine our dimensions and gain insights on consequences of
ES-CodeGen, we surveyed 32 practitioners, which include six developers who
submitted GitHub issues to opt-out from the Stack dataset (these impacted users
have real-world experience of ethically sourcing issues in code generation
models). The results lead to 11 dimensions of ES-CodeGen with a new dimension
on code quality as practitioners have noted its importance. We also identified
consequences, artifacts, and stages relevant to ES-CodeGen. Our post-survey
reflection showed that most practitioners tend to ignore social-related
dimensions despite their importance. Most practitioners either agreed or
strongly agreed that our survey help improve their understanding of ES-CodeGen.
Our study calls for attentions of various ethical issues towards ES-CodeGen.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces FreeLog, a method for zero-label cross-system log anomaly detection, which performs as well as methods requiring labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of detecting log anomalies with no labeled data in target systems, avoiding the cold-start issue.

Method: Propose FreeLog, a system-agnostic representation meta-learning method that operates without the need for any labeled target logs.

Result: FreeLog achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods, even without using labeled data, in experiments on three datasets.

Conclusion: FreeLog advances cross-system log anomaly detection by solving the zero-label challenge and maintaining robust performance.

Abstract: Log anomaly detection plays a critical role in ensuring the stability and
reliability of software systems. However, existing approaches rely on large
amounts of labeled log data, which poses significant challenges in real-world
applications. To address this issue, cross-system transfer has been identified
as a key research direction. State-of-the-art cross-system approaches achieve
promising performance with only a few labels from the target system. However,
their reliance on labeled target logs makes them susceptible to the cold-start
problem when labeled logs are insufficient. To overcome this limitation, we
explore a novel yet underexplored setting: zero-label cross-system log anomaly
detection, where the target system logs are entirely unlabeled. To this end, we
propose FreeLog, a system-agnostic representation meta-learning method that
eliminates the need for labeled target system logs, enabling cross-system log
anomaly detection under zero-label conditions. Experimental results on three
public log datasets demonstrate that FreeLog achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art methods that rely on a small amount of labeled data from the
target system.

Motivation: To enable enterprises, including SMEs, to adapt to digital transformation by facilitating a shift to process-oriented production models.

Method: A structured, guided method transforming text-based knowledge into diagrammatic workflows, requiring no prior expertise in Knowledge Engineering.

Result: Simplified and shared business process design through an accessible, stakeholder-inclusive approach.

Conclusion: The proposed method democratizes business process design, enhancing accessibility and collaboration for enterprises adapting to digital transformation.

Abstract: Enterprises are currently undergoing profound transformations due to the

shift is also important for small and medium-sized enterprises. A key
innovation frontier is the adoption of process-oriented production models. This
paper presents a knowledge-based method to support business experts in
designing business processes. The method requires no prior expertise in
Knowledge Engineering and guides designers through a structured sequence of
steps to produce a diagrammatic workflow of the target process. The
construction of the knowledge base starts from simple, text-based, knowledge
artefacts and then progresses towards more structured, formal representations.
The approach has been conceived to allow a shared approach for all stakeholders
and actors who participate in the BP design.

requiring collaboration among individuals with diverse expertise. We propose
AgentMesh, a Python-based framework that uses multiple cooperating LLM-powered
agents to automate software development tasks. In AgentMesh, specialized agents
- a Planner, Coder, Debugger, and Reviewer - work in concert to transform a
high-level requirement into fully realized code. The Planner agent first
decomposes user requests into concrete subtasks; the Coder agent implements
each subtask in code; the Debugger agent tests and fixes the code; and the
Reviewer agent validates the final output for correctness and quality. We
describe the architecture and design of these agents and their communication,
and provide implementation details including prompt strategies and workflow
orchestration. A case study illustrates AgentMesh handling a non-trivial
development request via sequential task planning, code generation, iterative
debugging, and final code review. We discuss how dividing responsibilities
among cooperative agents leverages the strengths of large language models while
mitigating single-agent limitations. Finally, we examine current limitations -
such as error propagation and context scaling - and outline future work toward
more robust, scalable multi-agent AI systems for software engineering
automation.

### [519] [CrossPL: Evaluating Large Language Models on Cross Programming Language Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19904)
*Zhanhang Xiong,Dongxia Wang,Yuekang Li,Xinyuan An,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents CrossPL, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate large language models' (LLMs) ability to generate cross-programming-language (CPL) interoperable code using inter-process communication (IPC). Results show current LLMs struggle with these tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the underexplored challenge of evaluating and improving LLMs' ability to generate accurate CPL-interoperable code, which is critical for building multi-language software systems.

Method: The authors created the CrossPL benchmark by analyzing multi-language GitHub repositories using finite state machines (FSMs) and employing an LLM-based pipeline to extract CPL code snippets, generate tasks, and validate correctness. They evaluated 20 LLMs using this benchmark.

Result: The evaluation revealed that even state-of-the-art language models struggle significantly in generating correct CPL-interoperable code for the tasks included in CrossPL, highlighting a critical gap in current LLM capabilities.

Conclusion: CrossPL serves as a comprehensive benchmark, revealing significant limitations in LLMs’ abilities for CPL tasks and emphasizing the need for targeted research to address this issue.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in software
engineering workflows, a critical capability remains underexplored: generating
correct code that enables cross-programming-language (CPL) interoperability.
This skill is essential for building complex systems that integrate components
written in multiple languages via mechanisms like inter-process communication
(IPC). To bridge this gap, we present CrossPL, the first benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate LLMs' ability to generate CPL-interoperating code.
CrossPL comprises 1,982 tasks centered around IPC, covering six widely-used
programming languages and seven representative CPL techniques. We construct
this benchmark by (i) analyzing 19,169 multi-language GitHub repositories using
156 hand-crafted finite state machines (FSMs), and (ii) developing an LLM-based
pipeline that automatically extracts CPL code snippets, generates task
instructions, and validates functional correctness. We evaluate 14
state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs and 6 code-oriented LLMs released in the
past three years on CrossPL via FSM-based validation. Results reveal that even
the best-performing models struggle with CPL scenarios, underscoring the need
for more targeted research in this space. Our benchmark and code are available

### [520] [The Impact of Fine-tuning Large Language Models on Automated Program Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19909)
*Roman Macháček,Anastasiia Grishina,Max Hort,Leon Moonen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study explores fine-tuning techniques for adapting pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to Automated Program Repair (APR) tasks and evaluates their impact on six LLMs using three benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating how different fine-tuning methods affect the performance of LLMs in Automated Program Repair tasks, while balancing computational costs and effectiveness.

Method: Empirical experiments on six state-of-the-art pre-trained LLMs tested across three APR benchmarks using three fine-tuning strategies: no fine-tuning, full fine-tuning, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) like LoRA and IA3.

Result: Full fine-tuning often led to decreased performance due to overfitting and data distribution issues, whereas parameter-efficient techniques like LoRA and IA3 improved performance and reduced the trainable parameters.

Conclusion: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods provide a promising way to enhance APR capabilities of LLMs while avoiding issues associated with full fine-tuning, such as overfitting.

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) uses various tools and techniques to help
developers achieve functional and error-free code faster. In recent years,
Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity as components in APR tool
chains because of their performance and flexibility. However, training such
models requires a significant amount of resources. Fine-tuning techniques have
been developed to adapt pre-trained LLMs to specific tasks, such as APR, and
enhance their performance at far lower computational costs than training from
scratch. In this study, we empirically investigate the impact of various
fine-tuning techniques on the performance of LLMs used for APR. Our experiments
provide insights into the performance of a selection of state-of-the-art LLMs
pre-trained on code. The evaluation is done on three popular APR benchmarks
(i.e., QuixBugs, Defects4J and HumanEval-Java) and considers six different LLMs
with varying parameter sizes (resp. CodeGen, CodeT5, StarCoder, DeepSeekCoder,
Bloom, and CodeLlama-2). We consider three training regimens: no fine-tuning,
full fine-tuning, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using LoRA and
IA3. We observe that full fine-tuning techniques decrease the benchmarking
performance of various models due to different data distributions and
overfitting. By using parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, we restrict
models in the amount of trainable parameters and achieve better results.

### [521] [Prometheus: Unified Knowledge Graphs for Issue Resolution in Multilingual Codebases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19942)
*Zimin Chen,Yue Pan,Siyu Lu,Jiayi Xu,Claire Le Goues,Martin Monperrus,He Ye*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Prometheus introduces a multi-agent system that utilizes knowledge graphs to enhance issue resolution across multi-language repositories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LM agents are limited to Python-only issues and don't work well in real-world or multi-language repository scenarios.

Method: Prometheus transforms repositories into knowledge graphs using Neo4j, built on encoded files, ASTs, and texts, combined with the DeepSeek-V3 model for resolving issues.

Result: Prometheus shows effectiveness across seven programming languages and resolves unique issues in real-world GitHub repositories, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: Prometheus advances issue resolution capabilities for multi-language repositories and real-world applications, laying groundwork for further development in this space.

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents, such as SWE-agent and OpenHands, have made
progress toward automated issue resolution. However, existing approaches are
often limited to Python-only issues and rely on pre-constructed containers in
SWE-bench with reproduced issues, restricting their applicability to real-world
and work for multi-language repositories. We present Prometheus, designed to
resolve real-world issues beyond benchmark settings. Prometheus is a
multi-agent system that transforms an entire code repository into a unified
knowledge graph to guide context retrieval for issue resolution. Prometheus
encodes files, abstract syntax trees, and natural language text into a graph of
typed nodes and five general edge types to support multiple programming
languages. Prometheus uses Neo4j for graph persistence, enabling scalable and
structured reasoning over large codebases. Integrated by the DeepSeek-V3 model,
Prometheus resolves 28.67% and 13.7% of issues on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench
Multilingual, respectively, with an average API cost of $0.23 and $0.38 per
issue. Prometheus resolves 10 unique issues not addressed by prior work and is
the first to demonstrate effectiveness across seven programming languages.
Moreover, it shows the ability to resolve real-world GitHub issues in the
LangChain and OpenHands repositories. We have open-sourced Prometheus at:

### [522] [PDLogger: Automated Logging Framework for Practical Software Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19951)
*Shengcheng Duan,Yihua Xu,Sheng Zhang,Shen Wang,Yue Duan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces PDLogger, a method for generating complete and high-quality log statements for software programs using a three-phase process and a large language model. It significantly outperforms previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing logging techniques, which focus on isolated sub-tasks and produce incomplete logs, thereby making logging less effective in practice.

Method: PDLogger's process has three phases: 1) Predicting candidate log positions using structured prompts with a large language model. 2) Generating full log statements by integrating precise program slicing and expanded variable extraction. 3) Refining the logs through level correction and context-sensitive deduplication.

Result: PDLogger demonstrated improvements over prior systems in multiple metrics, including substantial gains in position precision (139.0%), F1 score (69.2%), and message quality (65.7%), showcasing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: PDLogger provides a robust and general solution for practical, multi-log scenarios, significantly advancing automated log generation through its end-to-end approach and achieving superior results across several evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Logging is indispensable for maintaining the reliability and diagnosability
of modern software, yet developers still struggle to decide where and how to
log effectively. Existing automated logging techniques focus on isolated
sub-tasks - predicting a single log position, level, or message - and therefore
cannot produce complete, high-quality log statements that reflect real-world
practice in which multiple logs often appear inside one method. They also
neglect deeper semantic dependencies among methods and consider only a narrow
set of candidate variables, leading to superficial or incomplete logs. In this
paper, we present PDLogger, the first end-to-end log generation technique
expressly designed for practical, multi-log scenarios. PDLogger operates in
three phases. (1) Log position prediction: block-type-aware structured prompts
guide a large language model (LLM) to suggest candidate positions across all
control-flow blocks of a method. (2) Log generation: backward program slicing
supplies precise inter-procedural control and data-dependency context, while an
expanded variable extractor captures both member and external function
expressions; the enriched prompt enables the LLM to emit a full log statement
(position, level, message, variables). (3) Log refinement: level correction and
context-sensitive deduplication prune false positives and redundant logs. We
evaluate PDLogger on 3,113 log statements drawn from two widely used Java
projects. Compared with the strongest prior systems, PDLogger improves
log-position precision by 139.0 percent, F1 by 69.2 percent, level accuracy by
82.3 percent, variable precision by 131.8 percent, and message quality
(BERTScore) by 65.7 percent. The framework consistently performs well with
different mainstream LLMs, demonstrating robustness and generality. PDLogger's
implementation is available as open source to foster future research and
adoption.

### [523] [The Effect of Pointer Analysis on Semantic Conflict Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20081)
*Matheus Barbosa,Paulo Borba,Rodrigo Bonifácio,Victor Lira,Galileu Santos*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Current merge tools don't detect semantic conflicts effectively. Researchers investigated how pointer analysis might reduce false positives in semantic conflict static analyses but found tradeoffs in recall and F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of current merge tools in detecting semantic conflicts and to explore whether pointer analysis could reduce false positives in static semantic conflict detections.

Method: Conducted an empirical study by implementing semantic conflict detection analyses with and without pointer analysis, comparing their results on two datasets in terms of accuracy and computational performance.

Result: Pointer analysis reduced timeouts and false positives but increased false negatives, leading to a drop in recall and F1-score.

Conclusion: Hybrid analysis techniques should be explored to balance the tradeoffs posed by pointer analysis in semantic conflict detection.

Abstract: Current merge tools don't detect semantic conflicts, which occur when changes
from different developers are textually integrated but semantically interfere
with each other. Although researchers have proposed static analyses for
detecting semantic conflicts, these analyses suffer from significant false
positive rates. To understand whether such false positives could be reduced by
using pointer analysis in the implementation of semantic conflict static
analyses, we conduct an empirical study. We implement the same analysis with
and without pointer analysis, run them on two datasets, observe how often they
differ, and compare their accuracy and computational performance. Although
pointer analysis is known to improve precision in static analysis, we find that
its effect on semantic conflict detection can be drastic: we observe a
significant reduction in timeouts and false positives, but also a significant
increase in false negatives, with prohibitive drops in recall and F1-score.
These results suggest that, in the context of semantic conflict detection, we
should explore hybrid analysis techniques, combining aspects of both
implementations we compare in our study.

### [524] [From First Use to Final Commit: Studying the Evolution of Multi-CI Service Adoption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20095)
*Nitika Chopra,Taher A. Ghaleb*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores the adoption and transition patterns of Continuous Integration (CI) services by analyzing 18,924 Java projects on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how projects adopt and transition between multiple CI services over time, addressing a knowledge gap in multi-CI adoption.

Method: A historical analysis of CI service adoption in Java projects hosted on GitHub, covering a period from 2008 to 2024.

Result: Approximately one-in-five projects use multiple CI services, often during migration across services.

Conclusion: This research provides insights into multi-CI adoption, suggesting the need for strategies and tools to support CI service selection, coordination, and migration.

Abstract: Continuous Integration (CI) services, such as GitHub Actions and Travis CI,
are widely adopted in open-source development to automate testing and
deployment. Though existing research often examines individual services in
isolation, it remains unclear how projects adopt and transition between
multiple services over time. To understand how CI adoption is evolving across
services, we present a preliminary study analyzing the historical CI adoption
of 18,924 Java projects hosted on GitHub between January 2008 and December
2024, adopting at least one of eight CI services, namely Travis CI, AppVeyor,
CircleCI, Azure Pipelines, GitHub Actions, Bitbucket, GitLab CI, and Cirrus CI.
Specifically, we investigate: (1) how frequently CI services are co-adopted or
replaced, and (2) how maintenance activity varies across different services.
Our analysis shows that the use of multiple CI services within the same project
is a recurring pattern observed in nearly one in five projects, often
reflecting migration across CI services. Our study is among the first to
examine multi-CI adoption in practice, offering new insights for future
research and highlighting the need for strategies and tools to support service
selection, coordination, and migration in evolving CI environments.

*Xin Yin,Chao Ni,Liushan Chen,Xiaohu Yang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates training strategies like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for aligning large language models with code preferences, introducing an Adaptive Preference Optimization (APO) model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address uncertainty around the optimal training strategies for aligning large language models with varying code preferences.

Method: The study combines theoretical analysis and empirical experiments to compare SFT, SFT followed by DPO, and introduces APO as a dynamic training strategy.

Result: Experiments on six code preference tasks validate that APO outperforms traditional methods like SFT and SFT+DPO, providing adaptive advantages.

Conclusion: APO proves to be a superior strategy for aligning LLMs with code preferences, offering theoretical guidance and practical tools for deployment in software tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in
automating software development tasks. While recent advances leverage
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
models with human preferences, the optimal training strategy remains unclear
across diverse code preference scenarios. This paper systematically
investigates the roles of SFT and DPO in aligning LLMs with different code
preferences. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, we
hypothesize that SFT excels in scenarios with objectively verifiable optimal
solutions, while applying SFT followed by DPO (S&D) enables models to explore
superior solutions in scenarios without objectively verifiable optimal
solutions. Based on the analysis and experimental evidence, we propose Adaptive
Preference Optimization (APO), a dynamic integration approach that adaptively
amplifies preferred responses, suppresses dispreferred ones, and encourages
exploration of potentially superior solutions during training. Extensive
experiments across six representative code preference tasks validate our
theoretical hypotheses and demonstrate that APO consistently matches or
surpasses the performance of existing SFT and S&D strategies. Our work provides
both theoretical foundations and practical guidance for selecting appropriate
training strategies in different code preference alignment scenarios.

### [526] [From Prompt to Pipeline: Large Language Models for Scientific Workflow Development in Bioinformatics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20122)
*Khairul Alam,Banani Roy*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and DeepSeek-V3 can facilitate bioinformatics workflow generation in Scientific Workflow Systems (SWSs) such as Galaxy and Nextflow, focusing on their accuracy, usability, and effective prompting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many bioinformatics workflows are complex, making it challenging for domain experts without programming skills to create and understand them. This study explores whether LLMs can assist in lowering this barrier and improve workflow accessibility.

Method: The authors evaluated LLMs on tasks like SNP analysis, RNA-seq, DNA methylation, and data retrieval across Galaxy (graphical) and Nextflow (script-based) platforms. Their outputs were compared to community-curated benchmarks and assessed by expert reviewers. Prompting strategies were also systematically tested for effectiveness.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Flash performed the best for Galaxy workflows, while DeepSeek-V3 excelled in Nextflow. Role-based and chain-of-thought prompts notably improved workflow completeness and correctness, with each model showing specific strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: LLMs show significant promise in facilitating the creation of bioinformatics workflows, making these tools more accessible and reproducible for experts without programming skills. Effective prompt engineering further enhances their capabilities.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of bioinformatics data analysis has made Scientific
Workflow Systems (SWSs) like Galaxy and Nextflow essential for enabling
scalable, reproducible, and automated workflows. However, creating and
understanding these workflows remains challenging, particularly for domain
experts without programming expertise. This study investigates whether modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and DeepSeek-V3, can
support the generation of accurate, complete, and usable bioinformatics
workflows, and examines which prompting strategies most effectively guide this
process. We evaluate these models using diverse tasks such as SNP analysis,
RNA-seq, DNA methylation, and data retrieval, spanning both graphical (Galaxy)
and script-based (Nextflow) platforms. Expert reviewers assess the generated
workflows against community-curated baselines from the Galaxy Training Network
and nf-core repositories. The results show that Gemini 2.5 Flash excels in
generating Galaxy workflows, while DeepSeek-V3 performs strongly in Nextflow.
Prompting strategies significantly impact quality, with role-based and
chain-of-thought prompts improving completeness and correctness. While GPT-4o
benefits from structured inputs, DeepSeek-V3 offers rich technical detail,
albeit with some verbosity. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of
LLMs to lower the barrier for workflow development, improve reproducibility,
and democratize access to computational tools in bioinformatics, especially
when combined with thoughtful prompt engineering.

### [527] [Relating System Safety and Machine Learnt Model Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20135)
*Ganesh Pai*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the unclear relationship between system safety objectives and model performance requirements for machine learning components. It proposes a method using an emergency braking system example to derive safety-related performance targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a clear relationship between the safety objectives of aeronautical systems and the performance requirements of machine learning models.

Method: The method involves abstracting the machine learning component's behavior and then deriving minimum safety-related performance requirements and metrics based on safety objectives.

Result: The paper presents an initial method for deriving quantitative performance targets for both the machine learning component and its deep neural network to meet safety assessment goals.

Conclusion: The method is shown to be valid through rationale, while clarifying relevant assumptions, applicability constraints, and verification implications.

Abstract: The prediction quality of machine learnt models and the functionality they
ultimately enable (e.g., object detection), is typically evaluated using a
variety of quantitative metrics that are specified in the associated model
performance requirements. When integrating such models into aeronautical
applications, a top-down safety assessment process must influence both the
model performance metrics selected, and their acceptable range of values.
Often, however, the relationship of system safety objectives to model
performance requirements and the associated metrics is unclear. Using an
example of an aircraft emergency braking system containing a machine learnt
component (MLC) responsible for object detection and alerting, this paper first
describes a simple abstraction of the required MLC behavior. Then, based on
that abstraction, an initial method is given to derive the minimum
safety-related performance requirements, the associated metrics, and their
targets for the both MLC and its underlying deep neural network, such that they
meet the quantitative safety objectives obtained from the safety assessment
process. We give rationale as to why the proposed method should be considered
valid, also clarifying the assumptions made, the constraints on applicability,
and the implications for verification.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study prioritizes motivators driving ethical AI development using an MLR, ISM, MICMAC, and Fuzzy TOPSIS framework to identify and rank key factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the essential need for ethically sound AI systems and prevent unintended consequences by understanding and prioritizing key motivators of responsible AI development.

Method: The study utilized a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR), surveys, Interpretive Structure Modeling (ISM), MICMAC analysis, and Fuzzy TOPSIS to identify and classify key motivators for ethical AI.

Result: Twenty motivators were identified and categorized into eight groups, with Human Resource and Coordination standing out as highly influential. MICMAC and Fuzzy TOPSIS highlighted independent and critical factors like team diversity, AI governance, and data privacy.

Conclusion: Organizations should align strategies with identified motivators to effectively integrate ethical principles into their AI governance, policies, and development frameworks.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents transformative opportunities for
industries and society, but its responsible development is essential to prevent
unintended consequences. Ethically sound AI systems demand strategic planning,
strong governance, and an understanding of the key drivers that promote
responsible practices. This study aims to identify and prioritize the
motivators that drive the ethical development of AI systems. A Multivocal
Literature Review (MLR) and a questionnaire-based survey were conducted to
capture current practices in ethical AI. We applied Interpretive Structure
Modeling (ISM) to explore the relationships between motivator categories,
followed by MICMAC analysis to classify them by their driving and dependence
power. Fuzzy TOPSIS was used to rank these motivators by importance. Twenty key
motivators were identified and grouped into eight categories: Human Resource,
Knowledge Integration, Coordination, Project Administration, Standards,
Technology Factor, Stakeholders, and Strategy & Matrices. ISM results showed
that 'Human Resource' and 'Coordination' heavily influence other factors.
MICMAC analysis placed categories like Human Resource (CA1), Coordination
(CA3), Stakeholders (CA7), and Strategy & Matrices (CA8) in the independent
cluster, indicating high driving but low dependence power. Fuzzy TOPSIS ranked
motivators such as promoting team diversity, establishing AI governance bodies,
appointing oversight leaders, and ensuring data privacy as most critical. To
support ethical AI adoption, organizations should align their strategies with
these motivators and integrate them into their policies, governance models, and
development frameworks.

### [529] [Beyond Binary Moderation: Identifying Fine-Grained Sexist and Misogynistic Behavior on GitHub with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20358)
*Tanni Dev,Sayma Sultana,Amiangshu Bosu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-class classification framework using instruction-tuned LLMs to detect 12 types of sexist and misogynistic comments on GitHub, achieving significant improvements over existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the limitation of current moderation tools that rely on simplistic methods such as keyword filtering or binary classifiers, which fail to effectively detect nuanced and context-dependent sexist and misogynistic behaviors in technical communities like GitHub.

Method: The authors developed a multi-class classification framework based on instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs). They systematically refined prompts over 20 iterations and evaluated the model using a dataset of 1,440 labeled GitHub comments categorized into 12 sexism/misogyny types. Performance metrics included precision, recall, F1-score, and MCC.

Result: The optimized framework using GPT-4o with the 19th prompt iteration achieved an MCC of 0.501, significantly outperforming baseline models. However, it faced challenges in reliably interpreting nuanced and highly context-dependent comments.

Conclusion: Using well-crafted prompts with unambiguous definitions and structured outputs enhances the detection of sexism/misogyny on platforms like GitHub. This can lead to more effective moderation efforts and improved inclusivity in developer communities.

Abstract: Background: Sexist and misogynistic behavior significantly hinders inclusion
in technical communities like GitHub, causing developers, especially
minorities, to leave due to subtle biases and microaggressions. Current
moderation tools primarily rely on keyword filtering or binary classifiers,
limiting their ability to detect nuanced harm effectively.
  Aims: This study introduces a fine-grained, multi-class classification
framework that leverages instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to
identify twelve distinct categories of sexist and misogynistic comments on
GitHub.
  Method: We utilized an instruction-tuned LLM-based framework with systematic
prompt refinement across 20 iterations, evaluated on 1,440 labeled GitHub
comments across twelve sexism/misogyny categories. Model performances were
rigorously compared using precision, recall, F1-score, and the Matthews
Correlation Coefficient (MCC).
  Results: Our optimized approach (GPT-4o with Prompt 19) achieved an MCC of
0.501, significantly outperforming baseline approaches. While this model had
low false positives, it struggled to interpret nuanced, context-dependent
sexism and misogyny reliably.
  Conclusion: Well-designed prompts with clear definitions and structured
outputs significantly improve the accuracy and interpretability of sexism
detection, enabling precise and practical moderation on developer platforms
like GitHub.

### [530] [CIgrate: Automating CI Service Migration with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20402)
*Md Nazmul Hossain,Taher A. Ghaleb*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve Continuous Integration (CI) configuration migrations, which are currently limited by low-accuracy rule-based tools like CIMig.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing CI migration tools, particularly their susceptibility to errors and inefficiency, by leveraging the proven capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation and transformation.

Method: The proposed framework, CIgrate, utilizes LLMs for automating CI configuration migration. It will explore two setups: (a) zero-shot/few-shot prompting and (b) fine-tuning LLMs on a dataset of migration examples. The performance of CIgrate will be compared to the rule-based CIMig, with additional developer feedback.

Result: The research will clarify the accuracy and usability of LLM-generated CI configurations in comparison to CIMig, offering a new solution to automated CI migration.

Conclusion: If successful, CIgrate will represent a viable, possibly superior alternative to existing rule-based approaches by using LLMs, contributing significant advancements in software configuration automation and evolution.

Abstract: Continuous Integration (CI) configurations often need to be migrated between
services (e.g., Travis CI to GitHub Actions) as projects evolve, due to changes
in service capabilities, usage limits, or service deprecation. Previous studies
reported that migration across CI services is a recurring need in open-source
development. However, manual migration can be time-consuming and error-prone.
The state-of-the-art approach, CIMig, addresses this challenge by analyzing
past migration examples to create service-specific rules and produce equivalent
configurations across CI services. However, its relatively low accuracy raises
concerns about the overall feasibility of automated CI migration using
rule-based techniques alone. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation and transformation tasks,
suggesting potential to improve the automation, usability, and generalizability
of CI configuration migration. This registered report presents a study in which
we aim to assess whether CI migration can be improved using LLMs. To this end,
we propose CIgrate, an LLM-based framework for automatically migrating CI
configurations. We plan to evaluate the performance of CIgrate compared to
CIMig as a baseline, in different setups (a) zero-shot/few-shot prompting of
LLMs for configuration migration and (b) fine-tuning an LLM on a dataset of
already established CI service migrations. We will also seek developer feedback
on the quality and usability of the generated configurations. We formulate
research questions focusing on the accuracy of LLM-generated migrations versus
ground truth and the output of CIMig. The expected contributions include the
first LLM-powered approach for CI service migration, a comparative evaluation
of its effectiveness compared to rule-based approaches, and insight into
leveraging LLMs to support software configuration evolution.

TL;DR: The paper studies the experience of software testing professionals and highlights the creativity and adaptability involved in testing work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the perception that software testing is a repetitive, low-skill activity.

Method: Conducted a study with software testing professionals to understand the challenges they face during their tasks.

Result: Testing tasks involving creativity, learning, and time pressure are motivating, but excessive demands or lack of challenge can lead to frustration.

Conclusion: Balancing task complexity is critical to sustaining motivation, emphasizing that software testing is intellectually engaging.

Abstract: As software systems continue to grow in complexity, testing has become a
fundamental part of ensuring the quality and reliability of software products.
Yet, software testing is still often perceived, both in industry and academia,
as a repetitive, low-skill activity. This perception fails to recognize the
creativity, problem-solving, and adaptability required in testing work. Tasks
such as designing complex test cases, automating testing processes, and
handling shifting requirements illustrate the challenges testing professionals
regularly face. To better understand these experiences, we conducted a study
with software testing professionals to explore the nature of challenging tasks
in software testing and how they affect these professionals. Our findings show
that tasks involving creativity, ongoing learning, and time pressure are often
seen as motivating and rewarding. On the other hand, a lack of challenge or
overwhelming demands can lead to frustration and disengagement. These findings
demonstrate the importance of balancing task complexity to sustain motivation
and present software testing as a dynamic and intellectually engaging field.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how state-of-the-art code generation models handle unclear task descriptions and finds significant performance degradation due to ambiguous or contradictory requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world scenarios where task descriptions may be unclear, incomplete, or contradictory.

Method: The researchers extended the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks by introducing guided mutations to create flawed task descriptions and evaluated multiple LLMs of varying sizes and architectures on these altered datasets.

Result: The study reveals that even minor imperfections in task descriptions can cause significant drops in functional correctness, with larger LLMs showing more resilience than smaller ones but still being significantly affected.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the need to develop LLMs that are robust to imperfect task requirements, suggesting improvements in training strategies, evaluation benchmarks, and deployment practices for more reliable applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in code
generation tasks under idealized conditions, where task descriptions are clear
and precise. However, in practice, task descriptions frequently exhibit
ambiguity, incompleteness, or internal contradictions. In this paper, we
present the first empirical study examining the robustness of state-of-the-art
code generation models when faced with such unclear task descriptions. We
extend the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks by systematically introducing
realistic task descriptions flaws through guided mutation strategies, producing
a dataset that mirrors the messiness of informal developer instructions. We
evaluate multiple LLMs of varying sizes and architectures, analyzing their
functional correctness and failure modes across task descriptions categories.
Our findings reveal that even minor imperfections in task description phrasing
can cause significant performance degradation, with contradictory task
descriptions resulting in numerous logical errors. Moreover, while larger
models tend to be more resilient than smaller variants, they are not immune to
the challenges posed by unclear requirements. We further analyze semantic error
patterns and identify correlations between description clarity, model behavior,
and error types. Our results underscore the critical need for developing LLMs
that are not only powerful but also robust to the imperfections inherent in
natural user tasks, highlighting important considerations for improving model
training strategies, designing more realistic evaluation benchmarks, and
ensuring reliable deployment in practical software development environments.

### [533] [Distinguishing Quantum Software Bugs from Hardware Noise: A Statistical Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20475)
*Ahmik Virani,Devraj,Anirudh Suresh,Lei Zhang,M V Panduranga Rao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a statistical approach to distinguish between software bugs and hardware noise in quantum computing during the NISQ era.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing in the NISQ era involves challenges in pinpointing the causes of errors, which can either stem from quantum software bugs or hardware noise. Current methods from classical computing cannot address these issues effectively.

Method: The authors propose a statistical approach based on probabilistic metrics to differentiate between software bugs and hardware noise, tested using established quantum algorithms like Grover's, Deutsch-Jozsa, and Simon's.

Result: Experimental validation shows that the proposed method is both effective and practical, aiding in identifying and classifying unexpected behavior in quantum programs.

Conclusion: The study equips quantum software developers with a robust tool for diagnosing errors, improving reliability in quantum software development and execution.

Abstract: Quantum computing in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era presents
significant challenges in differentiating quantum software bugs from hardware
noise. Traditional debugging techniques from classical software engineering
cannot directly resolve this issue due to the inherently stochastic nature of
quantum computation mixed with noises from NISQ computers. To address this gap,
we propose a statistical approach leveraging probabilistic metrics to
differentiate between quantum software bugs and hardware noise. We evaluate our
methodology empirically using well-known quantum algorithms, including Grover's
algorithm, Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, and Simon's algorithm. Experimental results
demonstrate the efficacy and practical applicability of our approach, providing
quantum software developers with a reliable analytical tool to identify and
classify unexpected behavior in quantum programs.

*Howell Xia,Jonah Gluck,Sevval Simsek,David Sastre Medina,David Starobinski*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: VDGraph provides a graph-based approach to merge SBOM and SCA data, improving understanding of vulnerabilities in software dependency chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern software dependencies and vulnerabilities are challenging to manage due to their complexity.

Method: Introduces VDGraph, a knowledge graph-based method, consolidating SBOM and SCA outputs, and evaluates this approach on Java projects.

Result: VDGraph identifies risk points with high severity vulnerabilities and reveals patterns in vulnerability emergence along dependency paths.

Conclusion: VDGraph enhances visibility into vulnerability propagation within complex dependencies and enables scalable automated analysis.

Abstract: The high complexity of modern software supply chains necessitates tools such
as Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) to manage component dependencies, and
Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to identify vulnerabilities. While
there exists limited integration between SBOMs and SCA tools, a unified view of
complex dependency-vulnerability relationships remains elusive. In this paper,
we introduce VDGraph, a novel knowledge graph-based methodology for integrating
vulnerability and dependency data into a holistic view. VDGraph consolidates
SBOM and SCA outputs into a graph representation of software projects'
dependencies and vulnerabilities. We provide a formal description and analysis
of the theoretical properties of VDGraph and present solutions to manage
possible conflicts between the SBOM and SCA data. We further introduce and
evaluate a practical, proof-of-concept implementation of VDGraph using two
popular SBOM and SCA tools, namely CycloneDX Maven plugin and Google's
OSV-Scanner. We apply VDGraph on 21 popular Java projects. Through the
formulation of appropriate queries on the graphs, we uncover the existence of
concentrated risk points (i.e., vulnerable components of high severity
reachable through numerous dependency paths). We further show that
vulnerabilities predominantly emerge at a depth of three dependency levels or
higher, indicating that direct or secondary dependencies exhibit lower
vulnerability density and tend to be more secure. Thus, VDGraph contributes a
graph-theoretic methodology that improves visibility into how vulnerabilities
propagate through complex, transitive dependencies. Moreover, our
implementation, which combines open SBOM and SCA standards with Neo4j, lays a
foundation for scalable and automated analysis across real-world projects.

*Guanyu Chen,Haoyue Jiao,Shuyang Hou,Ziqi Liu,Lutong Xie,Shaowen Wu,Huayi Wu,Xuefeng Guan,Zhipeng Gui*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoJSEval, a multimodal evaluation framework for assessing large language models’ (LLMs) geospatial code generation abilities in JavaScript environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing adoption of LLMs for code generation in geospatial contexts demands systematic evaluation methodologies, highlighting challenges like semantic understanding and code synthesis in JavaScript-based geospatial tasks.

Method: GeoJSEval consists of a standardized test suite (GeoJSEval-Bench), a code submission engine, and an evaluation module to comprehensively assess LLMs across diverse metrics and mechanisms.

Result: The evaluation framework tested 18 state-of-the-art LLMs, uncovering substantial performance disparities in aspects like spatial semantic understanding and code reliability.

Conclusion: GeoJSEval establishes a foundational methodology with strong extensibility for standardizing the evaluation and optimization of geospatial code generation models in practical scenarios.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in code
generation tasks, geospatial code generation has emerged as a critical frontier
in the integration of artificial intelligence and geoscientific analysis. This
trend underscores the urgent need for systematic evaluation methodologies to
assess LLMs generation capabilities in geospatial contexts. In particular,
geospatial computation and visualization tasks in JavaScript environments rely
heavily on orchestrating diverse frontend libraries and ecosystems, placing
elevated demands on a model's semantic understanding and code synthesis
abilities. To address this challenge, we propose GeoJSEval--the first
multimodal, function-level automatic evaluation framework for LLMs in
JavaScript-based geospatial code generation. GeoJSEval comprises three core
components: a standardized test suite (GeoJSEval-Bench), a code submission
engine, and an evaluation module. It includes 432 function-level tasks and
2,071 structured test cases spanning five widely used JavaScript geospatial
libraries and 25 mainstream geospatial data types. GeoJSEval enables
multidimensional quantitative evaluation across metrics such as accuracy,
output stability, execution efficiency, resource consumption, and error type
distribution, and integrates boundary testing mechanisms to enhance robustness
and coverage. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 18 state-of-the-art LLMs
using GeoJSEval, revealing significant performance disparities and bottlenecks
in spatial semantic understanding, code reliability, and function invocation
accuracy. GeoJSEval provides a foundational methodology, evaluation resource,
and practical toolkit for the standardized assessment and optimization of
geospatial code generation models, with strong extensibility and applicability
in real-world scenarios.

### [536] [Intention-Driven Generation of Project-Specific Test Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20619)
*Binhang Qi,Yun Lin,Xinyi Weng,Yuhuan Huang,Chenyan Liu,Hailong Sun,Jin Song Dong*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces IntentionTest, a framework for generating project-specific software tests guided by validation intention rather than just code coverage. Tested on 13 open-source projects, the method outperformed baselines in semantic correctness and test success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test generation techniques overly rely on maximizing code coverage, ignoring developers' validation intentions and project-specific knowledge, which causes tests to fail code review and practical integration.

Method: IntentionTest uses validation intention presented as structured descriptions to guide test generation. It retrieves referable tests and transforms the problem into editing test code to match the intended validations, ensuring correctness and reusability.

Result: Tests generated by IntentionTest demonstrate significantly better semantic correctness, higher mutation scores (39.03% improvement), greater coverage overlap with ground truth (40.14%), and 21.30% more successful passing tests compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: IntentionTest addresses limitations in traditional test generation by leveraging validation intentions, improving practical adaptability and effectiveness for real-world projects.

Abstract: Test cases are valuable assets for maintaining software quality. While
numerous automated techniques have been proposed for generating tests (either
by maximizing code coverage or by translating focal code into test code),
practical tests are seldom driven by coverage alone. In real projects, each
test reflects a developer's validation intention for a specific behaviour and
embodies rich, project-specific knowledge: which specific APIs to call and what
assertions truly matter. Without considering such knowledge, tests can hardly
pass code review and be integrated into the software product.
  In this work, we propose IntentionTest, which generates project-specific
tests with validation intention as a structured description. Our design is
motivated by two insights: (1) a description of validation intention, compared
to coverage and focal code, carries more crucial information about what to
test; and (2) practical tests exhibit high code duplication, indicating that
domain knowledge is highly reusable for writing new tests. Given a focal code
and a description of validation intention (in the form of either an informal
comment or a formal test plan), IntentionTest retrieves a referable test in the
project to guide test generation. Moreover, IntentionTest reduces the test
generation problem into an editing problem on the test code regarding the
validation intention. It generates a test including both test prefix and
oracle, which aims to be executable and semantically correct.
  We evaluate IntentionTest against state-of-the-art baselines on 4,146 test
cases from 13 open-source projects. Specifically, compared to ChatTester,
IntentionTest can (1) generate significantly more semantically correct tests,
improving common mutation scores by 39.03% and coverage overlap with
ground-truth tests by 40.14%; (2) generate 21.30% more successful passing
tests.

### [537] [Client--Library Compatibility Testing with API Interaction Snapshots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20814)
*Gustave Monce,Thomas Degueule,Jean-Rémy Falleri,Romain Robbes*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a tool, Gilesi, to detect behavioral breaking changes (BBCs) in libraries, using snapshots of client-library API interactions to ensure compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers rely on third-party libraries which may introduce runtime-breaking changes undetectable by conventional regression tests.

Method: The approach records API interactions during client tests, creating snapshots that are later compared to identify runtime mismatches caused by library updates.

Result: The Gilesi framework successfully detects BBCs in experimental tests involving libraries with artificially introduced breaking changes.

Conclusion: Client-library compatibility can be enhanced by supplementing test assertions with detailed snapshots, providing better detection of subtle behavior-breaking changes.

Abstract: Modern software development heavily relies on third-party libraries to speed
up development and enhance quality. As libraries evolve, they may break the
tacit contract established with their clients by introducing behavioral
breaking changes (BBCs) that alter run-time behavior and silently break client
applications without being detected at compile time. Traditional regression
tests on the client side often fail to detect such BBCs, either due to limited
library coverage or weak assertions that do not sufficiently exercise the
library's expected behavior. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach
to client--library compatibility testing that leverages existing client tests
in a novel way. Instead of relying on developer-written assertions, we propose
recording the actual interactions at the API boundary during the execution of
client tests (protocol, input and output values, exceptions, etc.). These
sequences of API interactions are stored as snapshots which capture the exact
contract expected by a client at a specific point in time. As the library
evolves, we compare the original and new snapshots to identify perturbations in
the contract, flag potential BBCs, and notify clients. We implement this
technique in our prototype tool Gilesi, a Java framework that automatically
instruments library APIs, records snapshots, and compares them. Through a
preliminary case study on several client--library pairs with artificially
seeded BBCs, we show that Gilesi reliably detects BBCs missed by client test
suites.

### [538] [Search-Based Fuzzing For RESTful APIs That Use MongoDB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20848)
*Hernan Ghianni,Man Zhang,Juan P. Galeotti,Andrea Arcuri*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces novel techniques to improve search-based test generation for RESTful APIs interacting with NoSQL databases like MongoDB, achieving up to 18% higher code coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Testing RESTful APIs involving database states is challenging, and existing methods have limited ability to consider NoSQL database interactions effectively.

Method: The approach involves dynamic database state analysis via code instrumentation and injecting NoSQL data directly from test cases using the EvoMaster tool.

Result: The proposed techniques increased code coverage by up to 18% in experiments with six RESTful APIs and outperformed four black-box fuzzers.

Conclusion: The methods notably improve the efficacy of white-box testing for RESTful APIs, especially when involving NoSQL databases, proving their significance for real-world applications.

Abstract: In RESTful APIs, interactions with a database are a common and crucial
aspect. When generating whitebox tests, it is essential to consider the
database's state (i.e., the data contained in the database) to achieve higher
code coverage and uncover more hidden faults. This article presents novel
techniques to enhance search-based software test generation for RESTful APIs
interacting with NoSQL databases. Specifically, we target the popular MongoDB
database, by dynamically analyzing (via automated code instrumentation) the
state of the database during the test generation process. Additionally, to
achieve better results, our novel approach allows inserting NoSQL data directly
from test cases. This is particularly beneficial when generating the correct
sequence of events to set the NoSQL database in an appropriate state is
challenging or time-consuming. This method is also advantageous for testing
read-only microservices. Our novel techniques are implemented as an extension
of EvoMaster, the only open-source tool for white-box fuzzing RESTful APIs.
Experiments conducted on six RESTful APIs demonstrated significant improvements
in code coverage, with increases of up to 18% compared to existing white-box
approaches. To better highlight the improvements of our novel techniques,
comparisons are also carried out with four state-of-the-art black-box fuzzers.

### [539] [Enhancing Project-Specific Code Completion by Inferring Internal API Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20888)
*Le Deng,Xiaoxue Ren,Chao Ni,Ming Liang,David Lo,Zhongxin Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method to improve project-specific code completion by leveraging internal API information without relying on imports. A benchmark named ProjBench is also introduced to evaluate methods for code completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art code completion methods struggle to incorporate internal API information, especially when APIs aren't explicitly imported. Accurate project-specific code completion requires effective integration of such context.

Method: The authors infer internal API information by creating usage examples and semantic descriptions to extend API representation. A knowledge base is constructed for LLMs to generate completions, and a benchmark called ProjBench is developed for evaluation.

Result: The proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods, improving code exact match by 22.72% and identifier exact match by 18.31%. Integration with baselines boosted code match by 47.80% and identifier match by 35.55%.

Conclusion: This method offers a more effective way to leverage internal API information for code completion and sets a new benchmark standard (ProjBench) for evaluating performance.

Abstract: Project-specific code completion is a critical task that leverages context
from a project to generate accurate code. State-of-the-art methods use
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) and
project information for code completion. However, they often struggle to
incorporate internal API information, which is crucial for accuracy, especially
when APIs are not explicitly imported in the file.
  To address this, we propose a method to infer internal API information
without relying on imports. Our method extends the representation of APIs by
constructing usage examples and semantic descriptions, building a knowledge
base for LLMs to generate relevant completions. We also introduce ProjBench, a
benchmark that avoids leaked imports and consists of large-scale real-world
projects.
  Experiments on ProjBench and CrossCodeEval show that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, improving code exact match by
22.72% and identifier exact match by 18.31%. Additionally, integrating our
method with existing baselines boosts code match by 47.80% and identifier match
by 35.55%.

### [540] [Repairing vulnerabilities without invisible hands. A differentiated replication study on LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20977)
*Maria Camporese,Fabio Massacci*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study investigates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Automated Vulnerability Repair (AVR) by testing their robustness under conditions of imperfect fault localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to uncover whether the performance of LLMs in AVR is primarily due to their intrinsic capabilities or if external factors, like training-data leakage or specific fault localization, amplify their success.

Method: The study deliberately introduces errors by shifting the fault location away from the ground truth and uses a two-step process: an LLM generates a patch, a second LLM reviews it, and the results are validated through testing and manual audits.

Result: The pipeline evaluates patches under these conditions using Vul4J and VJTrans benchmarks, validating their correctness through automated and manual methods, and estimating error rates.

Conclusion: The findings aim to determine if LLMs' performance is reliant on context-dependent conditions or if they can generalize over erroneous inputs.

Abstract: Background: Automated Vulnerability Repair (AVR) is a fast-growing branch of
program repair. Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs)
outperform traditional techniques, extending their success beyond code
generation and fault detection.
  Hypothesis: These gains may be driven by hidden factors -- "invisible hands"
such as training-data leakage or perfect fault localization -- that let an LLM
reproduce human-authored fixes for the same code.
  Objective: We replicate prior AVR studies under controlled conditions by
deliberately adding errors to the reported vulnerability location in the
prompt. If LLMs merely regurgitate memorized fixes, both small and large
localization errors should yield the same number of correct patches, because
any offset should divert the model from the original fix.
  Method: Our pipeline repairs vulnerabilities from the Vul4J and VJTrans
benchmarks after shifting the fault location by n lines from the ground truth.
A first LLM generates a patch, a second LLM reviews it, and we validate the
result with regression and proof-of-vulnerability tests. Finally, we manually
audit a sample of patches and estimate the error rate with the
Agresti-Coull-Wilson method.

*Tianyong Yao,Victoria Booth*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper investigates how external light schedules and consistent routines influence nighttime waking in young children, using a mathematical model incorporating circadian rhythm, sleep drive, and light exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and manage the high prevalence of nighttime waking in young children, which disrupts their well-being and family functioning.

Method: The study uses the Homeostatic-Circadian-Light (HCL) model to analyze data from 2-3.5-year-olds, identifying parameter ranges that correlate with susceptibility to nighttime waking.

Result: It finds that low daytime light, excessive bright-light exposure, and irregular schedules, especially on weekends, worsen nighttime sleep disturbances.

Conclusion: Consistent daily routines and regulated exposure to light are essential for improving sleep health in young children, offering actionable insights for parenting practices.

Abstract: Sleep disturbances, particularly nighttime waking, are highly prevalent in
young children and can significantly disrupt not only the child's well-being
but also family functioning. Behavioral and environmental strategies, including
the regulation of light exposure, are typically recommended treatments for
nighttime waking. Using the Homeostatic-Circadian-Light (HCL) mathematical
model for sleep timing based on the interaction of the circadian rhythm, the
homeostatic sleep drive and external light, we analyze how external light
schedules can influence the occurrence of nighttime waking in young children.
We fit the model to data for sleep homeostasis and sleep behavior in 2 - 3.5
year olds and identified subsets of parameter ranges that fit the data but
indicated a susceptibility to nighttime waking. This suggests that as children
develop they may exhibit more or less propensity to awaken during the night.
Notably, parameter sets exhibiting earlier sleep timing were more susceptible
to nighttime waking. For a model parameter set susceptible to, but not
exhibiting, nighttime waking, we analyze how external light schedules affect
sleep patterns. We find that low daytime light levels can induce nighttime
sleep disruptions and extended bright-light exposure also promotes nighttime
waking. Further results suggest that consistent daily routines are essential;
irregular schedules, particularly during weekends, markedly worsen the
consolidation of nighttime sleep. Specifically, weekend delays in morning
lights-on and evening lights-off times result in nighttime sleep disruptions
and can influence sleep timing during the week. These results highlight how
external light, daily rhythms, and parenting routines interact to shape
childrens' sleep health, providing a useful framework for improving sleep
management practices.

*Hyun-Jun Jeon,Hansol Choi,Oh-Sang Kwon*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study introduces a generative adversarial inference (GAI) network that learns sensory representations and inference strategies directly from data, reproducing human-like perceptual biases based on sensory uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to explain how human perceptual biases, which flip based on uncertainty, could emerge through learning, rather than relying on handcrafted priors or fixed encoders.

Method: The GAI network employs joint reconstruction and adversarial training on data like Gabor stimuli to simultaneously learn sensory codes and inference strategies, without explicit prior or likelihood assumptions.

Result: The GAI model reproduces the transition from perceptual prior attraction to repulsion, recovers Fisher information profiles from efficient coding theory, and better captures human bias reversals compared to other learning alternatives.

Conclusion: This work provides a neurally plausible, end-to-end account of human perceptual bias by unifying efficient coding theory and deep learning within a single adversarial framework.

Abstract: Human perceptual estimates exhibit a striking reversal in bias depending on
uncertainty: they shift toward prior expectations under high sensory
uncertainty, but away from them when internal noise is dominant. While Bayesian
inference combined with efficient coding can explain this dual bias, existing
models rely on handcrafted priors or fixed encoders, offering no account of how
such representations and inferences could emerge through learning. We introduce
a Generative Adversarial Inference (GAI) network that simultaneously learns
sensory representations and inference strategies directly from data, without
assuming explicit likelihoods or priors. Through joint reconstruction and
adversarial training, the model learns a representation that approximates an
efficient code consistent with information-theoretic predictions. Trained on
Gabor stimuli with varying signal-to-noise ratios, GAI spontaneously reproduces
the full transition from prior attraction to repulsion, and recovers the Fisher
information profile predicted by efficient coding theory. It also captures the
characteristic bias reversal observed in human perception more robustly than
supervised or variational alternatives. These results show that a single
adversarially trained network can jointly acquire an efficient sensory code and
support Bayesian-consistent behavior, providing a neurally plausible,
end-to-end account of perceptual bias that unifies normative theory and deep
learning.

*Dengyi Zhao,Zhiheng Zhou,Guiying Yan,Dongxiao Yu,Xingqi Qi*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework, HOI-Brain, that utilizes signed higher-order interactions and topological features in fMRI data to improve brain disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current graph-based deep learning models, which largely ignore signed higher-order interactions and hinder a full understanding of complex brain communication.

Method: The authors developed a three-part computational pipeline: co-fluctuation assessment using Multiplication of Temporal Derivatives; encoding interactions in signed weighted simplicial complexes; and employing Persistent Homology theory with a multi-channel brain Transformer for feature integration.

Result: The proposed framework successfully diagnosed Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s syndrome, and autism spectrum disorder, aligning with established neuroscience literature.

Conclusion: HOI-Brain is a robust and interpretable framework for diagnosing brain diseases, offering biologically meaningful insights into brain communication pathways.

Abstract: Accurately characterizing higher-order interactions of brain regions and
extracting interpretable organizational patterns from Functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging data is crucial for brain disease diagnosis. Current
graph-based deep learning models primarily focus on pairwise or triadic
patterns while neglecting signed higher-order interactions, limiting
comprehensive understanding of brain-wide communication. We propose HOI-Brain,
a novel computational framework leveraging signed higher-order interactions and
organizational patterns in fMRI data for brain disease diagnosis. First, we
introduce a co-fluctuation measure based on Multiplication of Temporal
Derivatives to detect higher-order interactions with temporal resolution. We
then distinguish positive and negative synergistic interactions, encoding them
in signed weighted simplicial complexes to reveal brain communication insights.
Using Persistent Homology theory, we apply two filtration processes to these
complexes to extract signed higher-dimensional neural organizations
spatiotemporally. Finally, we propose a multi-channel brain Transformer to
integrate heterogeneous topological features. Experiments on Alzheimer' s
disease, Parkinson' s syndrome, and autism spectrum disorder datasets
demonstrate our framework' s superiority, effectiveness, and interpretability.
The identified key brain regions and higher-order patterns align with
neuroscience literature, providing meaningful biological insights.

*Mikkel Schöttner Sieler,Thomas A. W. Bolton,Jagruti Patel,Patric Hagmann*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study compares nine feature subtypes derived from resting-state fMRI recordings for predicting behavioral variables, identifying functional connectivity (FC) as the best predictor for cognition, age, and sex.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve predictions of behavioral and demographic variables using neuroimaging, which could lead to biomarkers for mental and neurological disorders.

Method: The study analyzes data from 979 subjects using features extracted from resting-state fMRI, including functional connectivity (FC) and graph-based signal processing (GSP), and tests predictions against various behavioral and demographic targets.

Result: Functional connectivity (FC) outperformed other features in predicting cognition, age, and sex. Variability-based and graph signal processing features also showed promise.

Conclusion: FC is validated as a robust predictor for behavioral features, yet other feature types like GSP and variability-based measures show potential, especially for sex prediction. The trade-off between sample size and scan time is critical.

Abstract: Predicting behavioral variables from neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to allow the development of
neuroimaging biomarkers of mental and neurological disorders. A crucial
processing step to this aim is the extraction of suitable features. These can
differ in how well they predict the target of interest, and how this prediction
scales with sample size and scan time. Here, we compare nine feature subtypes
extracted from resting-state functional MRI recordings for behavior prediction,
ranging from regional measures of functional activity to functional
connectivity (FC) and metrics derived with graph signal processing (GSP), a
principled approach for the extraction of structure-informed functional
features. We study 979 subjects from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult
dataset, predicting summary scores for mental health, cognition, processing
speed, and substance use, as well as age and sex. The scaling properties of the
features are investigated for different combinations of sample size and scan
time. FC comes out as the best feature for predicting cognition, age, and sex.
Graph power spectral density is the second best for predicting cognition and
age, while for sex, variability-based features show potential as well. When
predicting sex, the low-pass graph filtered coupled FC slightly outperforms the
simple FC variant. None of the other targets were predicted significantly. The
scaling results point to higher performance reserves for the better-performing
features. They also indicate that it is important to balance sample size and
scan time when acquiring data for prediction studies. The results confirm FC as
a robust feature for behavior prediction, but also show the potential of GSP
and variability-based measures. We discuss the implications for future
prediction studies in terms of strategies for acquisition and sample
composition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in heuristic-based symbolic regression approaches, such as their reliance on arbitrary criteria and lack of performance guarantees, by proposing a more principled probabilistic framework.

Method: The paper employs principles of information theory and statistical physics to define model plausibility, moving away from heuristic strategies and advocating for model ensembles over single models.

Result: The probabilistic approach establishes strong theoretical underpinnings, offering performance guarantees and insights into model ensemble usage, outperforming traditional heuristic methods.

Conclusion: A probabilistic approach to symbolic regression provides a principled and robust alternative to heuristics, improving both theoretical rigor and practical outcomes in learning mathematical models from data.

Abstract: Symbolic regression automates the process of learning closed-form
mathematical models from data. Standard approaches to symbolic regression, as
well as newer deep learning approaches, rely on heuristic model selection
criteria, heuristic regularization, and heuristic exploration of model space.
Here, we discuss the probabilistic approach to symbolic regression, an
alternative to such heuristic approaches with direct connections to information
theory and statistical physics. We show how the probabilistic approach
establishes model plausibility from basic considerations and explicit
approximations, and how it provides guarantees of performance that heuristic
approaches lack. We also discuss how the probabilistic approach compels us to
consider model ensembles, as opposed to single models.

*Leo Guo,Adwait Inamdar,Willem D. van Driel,GuoQi Zhang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive Bayesian optimization framework using Gaussian process regression to tackle computationally expensive problems, highlighting its effectiveness in improving efficiency in solder joint reliability issues with reduced computational budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the computational challenges associated with optimizing solder joint reliability under thermomechanical loading by leveraging the efficiency of surrogate models and adaptive Bayesian optimization.

Method: The authors propose an adaptive heuristic framework for Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression that adjusts hyperparameters throughout the optimization iterations. They validate this against synthetic minimization problems and apply it to a practical engineering case of minimizing non-linear creep strain under thermal loads.

Result: Adaptive Bayesian optimization outperforms regular methods by achieving similar or better optimization results while cutting the computational budget in half. It demonstrates an average improvement of 3% in efficiency.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of the adaptive Bayesian framework in reducing computational overhead while delivering better optimization results, particularly in applications like solder joint reliability. The reproducibility is promoted through open-source availability of the data-driven implementation.

Abstract: Solder joint reliability related to failures due to thermomechanical loading
is a critically important yet physically complex engineering problem. As a
result, simulated behavior is oftentimes computationally expensive. In an
increasingly data-driven world, the usage of efficient data-driven design
schemes is a popular choice. Among them, Bayesian optimization (BO) with
Gaussian process regression is one of the most important representatives. The
authors argue that computational savings can be obtained from exploiting
thorough surrogate modeling and selecting a design candidate based on multiple
acquisition functions. This is feasible due to the relatively low computational
cost, compared to the expensive simulation objective. This paper addresses the
shortcomings in the adjacent literature by providing and implementing a novel
heuristic framework to perform BO with adaptive hyperparameters across the
various optimization iterations. Adaptive BO is subsequently compared to
regular BO when faced with synthetic objective minimization problems. The
results show the efficiency of adaptive BO when compared any worst-performing
regular Bayesian schemes. As an engineering use case, the solder joint
reliability problem is tackled by minimizing the accumulated non-linear creep
strain under a cyclic thermal load. Results show that adaptive BO outperforms
regular BO by 3% on average at any given computational budget threshold,
critically saving half of the computational expense budget. This practical
result underlines the methodological potential of the adaptive Bayesian
data-driven methodology to achieve better results and cut optimization-related
expenses. Lastly, in order to promote the reproducibility of the results, the
data-driven implementations are made available on an open-source basis.

### [547] [Bag of Coins: A Statistical Probe into Neural Confidence Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19774)
*Agnideep Aich,Ashit Baran Aich,Md Monzur Murshed,Sameera Hewage,Bruce Wade*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Bag-of-Coins (BoC) test, a novel method for assessing the internal consistency of neural network confidence scores, and demonstrates its efficacy on Vision Transformers (ViTs) while identifying discrepancies in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern neural networks often provide poorly calibrated confidence scores, which hinder their reliability in critical applications. Existing calibration methods fail to explore internal consistency, highlighting the need for a new approach.

Method: The Bag-of-Coins (BoC) test is implemented as a non-parametric statistical probe that reframes confidence estimation as a frequentist hypothesis test, examining whether a model's top-ranked class outperforms random competitors at a rate consistent with its softmax probability.

Result: On Vision Transformers, BoC achieves near-perfect calibration with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.0212, significantly outperforming temperature-scaled baselines. On CNNs like ResNet, BoC reveals inconsistencies between predictions and internal logit structures.

Conclusion: BoC serves as both a state-of-the-art calibration method for certain architectures and a diagnostic tool for exposing how different neural network types represent uncertainty, advancing the understanding of model confidence in modern deep learning.

Abstract: Modern neural networks, despite their high accuracy, often produce poorly
calibrated confidence scores, limiting their reliability in high-stakes
applications. Existing calibration methods typically post-process model outputs
without interrogating the internal consistency of the predictions themselves.
In this work, we introduce a novel, non-parametric statistical probe, the
Bag-of-Coins (BoC) test, that examines the internal consistency of a
classifier's logits. The BoC test reframes confidence estimation as a
frequentist hypothesis test: does the model's top-ranked class win 1-v-1
contests against random competitors at a rate consistent with its own stated
softmax probability? When applied to modern deep learning architectures, this
simple probe reveals a fundamental dichotomy. On Vision Transformers (ViTs),
the BoC output serves as a state-of-the-art confidence score, achieving
near-perfect calibration with an ECE of 0.0212, an 88% improvement over a
temperature-scaled baseline. Conversely, on Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) like ResNet, the probe reveals a deep inconsistency between the model's
predictions and its internal logit structure, a property missed by traditional
metrics. We posit that BoC is not merely a calibration method, but a new
diagnostic tool for understanding and exposing the differing ways that popular
architectures represent uncertainty.

### [548] [Sparse-mode Dynamic Mode Decomposition for Disambiguating Local and Global Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19787)
*Sara M. Ichinaga,Steven L. Brunton,Aleksandr Y. Aravkin,J. Nathan Kutz*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Sparse-mode DMD is a novel extension of optimized DMD that uses sparsity-promoting regularization to approximate spatially localized modes from spatiotemporal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current optimized DMD methods sometimes fail to distinguish between spatially localized and global modes, which limits effectiveness in applications requiring differentiation of discrete and continuous spectra.

Method: The paper introduces a sparsity-promoting regularization technique within the optimized DMD framework to isolate spatially localized modes. Synthetic and real-world systems are analyzed as test cases.

Result: Sparse-mode DMD successfully identifies spatially localized modes while maintaining noise robustness, allowing for the differentiation of discrete and continuous spectra in various settings.

Conclusion: The sparse-mode DMD enhances DMD's capability to extract localized structures, offering a robust and effective tool for analyzing diverse datasets and spectrums in an unsupervised and automated manner.

Abstract: The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a data-driven approach that extracts
the dominant features from spatiotemporal data. In this work, we introduce
sparse-mode DMD, a new variant of the optimized DMD framework that specifically
leverages sparsity-promoting regularization in order to approximate DMD modes
which have localized spatial structure. The algorithm maintains the
noise-robust properties of optimized DMD while disambiguating between modes
which are spatially local versus global in nature. In many applications, such
modes are associated with discrete and continuous spectra respectively, thus
allowing the algorithm to explicitly construct, in an unsupervised manner, the
distinct portions of the spectrum. We demonstrate this by analyzing synthetic
and real-world systems, including examples from optical waveguides, quantum
mechanics, and sea surface temperature data.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The study compares various models to predict Parkinson's Disease (PD) progression using voice biomarkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To utilize voice biomarkers for non-invasive tracking of Parkinson's Disease progression and UPDRS scores, addressing challenges like complex and nonlinear longitudinal data.

Method: The study benchmarks Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) against two advanced neural-hybrid approaches: GNMM and NME, utilizing the Oxford Parkinson's telemonitoring voice dataset for evaluation.

Result: The models' performance is analyzed by predicting Total UPDRS scores, providing insights into their practical use in PD research and clinical contexts.

Conclusion: Advanced hybrid neural-network-based models show promise in tracking PD progression, offering valuable tools for telemonitoring applications.

Abstract: Predicting Parkinson's Disease (PD) progression is crucial, and voice
biomarkers offer a non-invasive method for tracking symptom severity (UPDRS
scores) through telemonitoring. Analyzing this longitudinal data is challenging
due to within-subject correlations and complex, nonlinear patient-specific
progression patterns. This study benchmarks LMMs against two advanced hybrid
approaches: the Generalized Neural Network Mixed Model (GNMM) (Mandel 2021),
which embeds a neural network within a GLMM structure, and the Neural Mixed
Effects (NME) model (Wortwein 2023), allowing nonlinear subject-specific
parameters throughout the network. Using the Oxford Parkinson's telemonitoring
voice dataset, we evaluate these models' performance in predicting Total UPDRS
to offer practical guidance for PD research and clinical applications.

*Xintao Xia,Linjun Zhang,Zhanrui Cai*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper focuses on enhancing privacy-preserving machine learning by analyzing the asymptotic properties of randomized subsampling in DP-SGD and proposing valid methods for confidence intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of statistical inference methods tailored for randomized subsampling in Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD).

Method: The authors establish asymptotic properties for SGD under randomized subsampling, extend these to DP-SGD, and propose two methods (plug-in method and random scaling method) for valid confidence intervals.

Result: The proposed confidence intervals achieve nominal coverage rates without compromising privacy, as supported by extensive numerical analysis.

Conclusion: This work provides theoretical and practical advancements in understanding and constructing valid statistical inference for DP-SGD while preserving privacy.

Abstract: Privacy preservation in machine learning, particularly through Differentially
Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), is critical for sensitive data
analysis. However, existing statistical inference methods for SGD predominantly
focus on cyclic subsampling, while DP-SGD requires randomized subsampling. This
paper first bridges this gap by establishing the asymptotic properties of SGD
under the randomized rule and extending these results to DP-SGD. For the output
of DP-SGD, we show that the asymptotic variance decomposes into statistical,
sampling, and privacy-induced components. Two methods are proposed for
constructing valid confidence intervals: the plug-in method and the random
scaling method. We also perform extensive numerical analysis, which shows that
the proposed confidence intervals achieve nominal coverage rates while
maintaining privacy.

### [551] [Multivariate Conformal Prediction via Conformalized Gaussian Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20941)
*Sacha Braun,Eugène Berta,Michael I. Jordan,Francis Bach*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a computationally efficient method for enhanced conditional coverage in conformal prediction by introducing a Gaussian-based score that reduces sampling complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conditional coverage in conformal prediction is crucial but challenging due to expensive computational requirements and unattainable exactness without overly restrictive assumptions.

Method: The paper utilizes Gaussian-based scores to replace empirical CDF-based scores, offering closed-form expressions that improve computational efficiency. Extensions include handling missing output values, refining prediction sets with partial data, and creating predictions in transformed output spaces.

Result: Empirical studies demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better conditional coverage approximation in multivariate settings compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The Gaussian-based conformal prediction method not only enhances computational practicality but also improves performance in capturing heteroskedasticity and other multivariate dependencies.

Abstract: While achieving exact conditional coverage in conformal prediction is
unattainable without making strong, untestable regularity assumptions, the
promise of conformal prediction hinges on finding approximations to conditional
guarantees that are realizable in practice. A promising direction for obtaining
conditional dependence for conformal sets--in particular capturing
heteroskedasticity--is through estimating the conditional density
$\mathbb{P}_{Y|X}$ and conformalizing its level sets. Previous work in this
vein has focused on nonconformity scores based on the empirical cumulative
distribution function (CDF). Such scores are, however, computationally costly,
typically requiring expensive sampling methods. To avoid the need for sampling,
we observe that the CDF-based score reduces to a Mahalanobis distance in the
case of Gaussian scores, yielding a closed-form expression that can be directly
conformalized. Moreover, the use of a Gaussian-based score opens the door to a
number of extensions of the basic conformal method; in particular, we show how
to construct conformal sets with missing output values, refine conformal sets
as partial information about $Y$ becomes available, and construct conformal
sets on transformations of the output space. Finally, empirical results
indicate that our approach produces conformal sets that more closely
approximate conditional coverage in multivariate settings compared to
alternative methods.

### [552] [Locally Adaptive Conformal Inference for Operator Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20975)
*Trevor Harris,Yan Liu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for uncertainty quantification in neural operator models, ensuring statistically guaranteed predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural operator models have improved predictive accuracy and scalability but lack mechanisms for quantifying predictive uncertainty.

Method: The paper proposes Local Spectral Conformal Inference (LSCI), employing projection-based scoring and localized conformal inference to generate prediction sets with statistical coverage guarantees.

Result: LSCI achieves adaptive and statistically valid uncertainty quantification, demonstrated across synthetic and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: LSCI enhances predictive uncertainty estimation for neural operators, addressing a critical gap in operator modeling frameworks.

Abstract: Operator models are regression algorithms for functional data and have become
a key tool for emulating large-scale dynamical systems. Recent advances in deep
neural operators have dramatically improved the accuracy and scalability of
operator modeling, but lack an inherent notion of predictive uncertainty. We
introduce Local Spectral Conformal Inference (LSCI), a new framework for
locally adaptive, distribution-free uncertainty quantification for neural
operator models. LSCI uses projection-based depth scoring and localized
conformal inference to generate function-valued prediction sets with
statistical guarantees. We prove approximate finite-sample marginal coverage
under local exchangeability, and demonstrate significant gains in adaptivity
and coverage across synthetic and real-world operator learning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge in accurately classifying lung nodules as benign or malignant using CT images, enhancing automation and reliability in lung cancer screening.

Method: The authors developed a stacked model using three pretrained backbones (EfficientNet V2 S, MobileViT XXS, DenseNet201) with a custom classification head, integrating two-stage attention mechanisms, a lightweight meta-learner, and techniques like dynamic focal loss, MixUp, and test-time augmentation.

Result: On the LIDC-IDRI dataset, the model demonstrated 98.09% accuracy, 0.9961 AUC, and notable improvements in sensitivity (98.73%) and specificity (98.96%), reducing error rates by 35% compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a highly accurate and robust automated tool for assisting radiologists in lung nodule classification and lung cancer screening, validated by its performance on challenging cases.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of binary lung nodule classification
(benign vs malignant) using CT images by proposing a multi-level attention
stacked ensemble of deep neural networks. Three pretrained backbones --
EfficientNet V2 S, MobileViT XXS, and DenseNet201 -- are each adapted with a
custom classification head tailored to 96 x 96 pixel inputs. A two-stage
attention mechanism learns both model-wise and class-wise importance scores
from concatenated logits, and a lightweight meta-learner refines the final
prediction. To mitigate class imbalance and improve generalization, we employ
dynamic focal loss with empirically calculated class weights, MixUp
augmentation during training, and test-time augmentation at inference.
Experiments on the LIDC-IDRI dataset demonstrate exceptional performance,
achieving 98.09 accuracy and 0.9961 AUC, representing a 35 percent reduction in
error rate compared to state-of-the-art methods. The model exhibits balanced
performance across sensitivity (98.73) and specificity (98.96), with
particularly strong results on challenging cases where radiologist disagreement
was high. Statistical significance testing confirms the robustness of these
improvements across multiple experimental runs. Our approach can serve as a
robust, automated aid for radiologists in lung cancer screening.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This study developed a machine learning model using preoperative data and CT imaging to predict recurrence risk in colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) patients post-surgery, achieving an AUC of 0.723 for 3-month predictions while addressing the risk of data leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional clinical models are suboptimal in predicting postoperative recurrence risk in CRLM patients, necessitating more accurate and reliable methods for better clinical decision-making.

Method: A machine learning model was developed using preoperative baseline clinical parameters and radiomic features from contrast-enhanced CT imaging, focusing on predicting recurrence at 3, 6, and 12 months post-surgery. Data leakage risks were explicitly mitigated.

Result: The 3-month model achieved an AUC of 0.723 in cross-validation and outperformed generic "treat-all" or "treat-none" strategies in decision curve analysis, demonstrating its clinical utility.

Conclusion: The study created a clinically applicable and robust predictive model for early CRLM recurrence. It also highlighted the critical issue of data leakage in prognostic modeling and presented a framework to enhance model reliability for real-world use.

Abstract: Prognostic evaluation in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM)
remains challenging due to suboptimal accuracy of conventional clinical models.
This study developed and validated a robust machine learning model for
predicting postoperative recurrence risk. Preliminary ensemble models achieved
exceptionally high performance (AUC $>$ 0.98) but incorporated postoperative
features, introducing data leakage risks. To enhance clinical applicability, we
restricted input variables to preoperative baseline clinical parameters and
radiomic features from contrast-enhanced CT imaging, specifically targeting
recurrence prediction at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The 3-month
recurrence prediction model demonstrated optimal performance with an AUC of
0.723 in cross-validation. Decision curve analysis revealed that across
threshold probabilities of 0.55-0.95, the model consistently provided greater
net benefit than "treat-all" or "treat-none" strategies, supporting its utility
in postoperative surveillance and therapeutic decision-making. This study
successfully developed a robust predictive model for early CRLM recurrence with
confirmed clinical utility. Importantly, it highlights the critical risk of
data leakage in clinical prognostic modeling and proposes a rigorous framework
to mitigate this issue, enhancing model reliability and translational value in
real-world settings.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpecBPP, a self-supervised learning method for hyperspectral imagery (HSI) that achieves state-of-the-art results in Soil Organic Carbon estimation, leveraging spectral band ordering as a pretext task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the popularity of self-supervised learning in vision and language, its potential has not been fully explored in hyperspectral imagery, which has unique sequential spectral structures.

Method: The authors propose SpecBPP, a self-supervised method that uses spectral band permutation prediction. It challenges models to reorder shuffled spectral segments via a curriculum-based training strategy for increasing permutation difficulty.

Result: SpecBPP outperformed baselines such as MAE and JEPA on Soil Organic Carbon estimation with EnMAP satellite data, achieving $R^2$ of 0.9456, RMSE of 1.1053%, and RPD of 4.19.

Conclusion: SpecBPP demonstrates that spectral order prediction is an effective pretext task, showcasing the potential of self-supervised learning for hyperspectral imagery and enabling advancements in scientific representation learning for remote sensing.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has revolutionized representation learning in vision
and language, but remains underexplored for hyperspectral imagery (HSI), where
the sequential structure of spectral bands offers unique opportunities. In this
work, we propose Spectral Band Permutation Prediction (SpecBPP), a novel
self-supervised learning framework that leverages the inherent spectral
continuity in HSI. Instead of reconstructing masked bands, SpecBPP challenges a
model to recover the correct order of shuffled spectral segments, encouraging
global spectral understanding. We implement a curriculum-based training
strategy that progressively increases permutation difficulty to manage the
factorial complexity of the permutation space. Applied to Soil Organic Carbon
(SOC) estimation using EnMAP satellite data, our method achieves
state-of-the-art results, outperforming both masked autoencoder (MAE) and
joint-embedding predictive (JEPA) baselines. Fine-tuned on limited labeled
samples, our model yields an $R^2$ of 0.9456, RMSE of 1.1053%, and RPD of 4.19,
significantly surpassing traditional and self-supervised benchmarks. Our
results demonstrate that spectral order prediction is a powerful pretext task
for hyperspectral understanding, opening new avenues for scientific
representation learning in remote sensing and beyond.

Conclusion: Handcrafted features enhance deep representations, achieving competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art methods while remaining computationally efficient for clinical settings.

Abstract: Automated breast cancer classification from mammography remains a significant
challenge due to subtle distinctions between benign and malignant tissue. In
this work, we present a hybrid framework combining deep convolutional features
from a ResNet-50 backbone with handcrafted descriptors and transformer-based

ResNet-50 and DINOv2 features improves AUC to 79.6% (setup d1), with a peak
recall of 80.5% (setup d1) and highest F1 score of 67.4% (setup d1). Our
experiments show that handcrafted features not only complement deep
representations but also enhance performance beyond transformer-based
embeddings. This hybrid fusion approach achieves results comparable to
state-of-the-art methods while maintaining architectural simplicity and
computational efficiency, making it a practical and effective solution for
clinical decision support.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the domain shift problem in multi-source CT-scan classification using preprocessing methods for input-space standardization, demonstrating their effectiveness in improving cross-source generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts impair cross-source generalization in multi-source CT-scan classification, necessitating robust preprocessing methods to standardize input data and mitigate inter-source variance.

Method: The study combines Spatial-Slice Feature Learning (SSFL++) and Kernel-Density-based Slice Sampling (KDS) for spatial and temporal standardization of input data. This alignment reduces inter-source variance, helping neural networks generalize better across domains.

Result: The proposed preprocessing pipeline demonstrated consistent performance improvements across various network architectures, with experimental validation showing clear benefits from the methods used.

Conclusion: Input-space standardization using SSFL++ and KDS is a robust and practical solution for improving cross-source generalization in multi-institutional medical imaging, as evidenced by competitive challenge results.

Abstract: Multi-source CT-scan classification suffers from domain shifts that impair
cross-source generalization. While preprocessing pipelines combining
Spatial-Slice Feature Learning (SSFL++) and Kernel-Density-based Slice Sampling
(KDS) have shown empirical success, the mechanisms underlying their domain
robustness remain underexplored. This study analyzes how this input-space
standardization manages the trade-off between local discriminability and
cross-source generalization. The SSFL++ and KDS pipeline performs spatial and
temporal standardization to reduce inter-source variance, effectively mapping
disparate inputs into a consistent target space. This preemptive alignment
mitigates domain shift and simplifies the learning task for network
optimization. Experimental validation demonstrates consistent improvements
across architectures, proving the benefits stem from the preprocessing itself.
The approach's effectiveness was validated by securing first place in a
competitive challenge, supporting input-space standardization as a robust and
practical solution for multi-institutional medical imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of medical image data and class imbalance limits deep learning model effectiveness for early diagnosis of diseases like skin lesions.

Method: The method involves fine-tuning Stable Diffusion-2.0 using LoRA and optimizing multi-objective loss functions to produce synthetic skin lesion images and masks based on textual descriptions.

Result: The hybrid dataset combining real and synthetic images significantly improved classification and segmentation metrics such as accuracy (by 8%-15%), F1-score, Dice coefficient, and IoU.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable solution to medical imaging challenges, enhancing diagnosis reliability for rare diseases.

Abstract: Medical image analysis plays a pivotal role in the early diagnosis of
diseases such as skin lesions. However, the scarcity of data and the class
imbalance significantly hinder the performance of deep learning models. We
propose a novel method that leverages the pretrained Stable Diffusion-2.0 model
to generate high-quality synthetic skin lesion images and corresponding
segmentation masks. This approach augments training datasets for classification
and segmentation tasks. We adapt Stable Diffusion-2.0 through domain-specific
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and joint optimization of
multi-objective loss functions, enabling the model to simultaneously generate
clinically relevant images and segmentation masks conditioned on textual
descriptions in a single step. Experimental results show that the generated
images, validated by FID scores, closely resemble real images in quality. A
hybrid dataset combining real and synthetic data markedly enhances the
performance of classification and segmentation models, achieving substantial
improvements in accuracy and F1-score of 8% to 15%, with additional positive
gains in other key metrics such as the Dice coefficient and IoU. Our approach
offers a scalable solution to address the challenges of medical imaging data,
contributing to improved accuracy and reliability in diagnosing rare diseases.

### [559] [Implicit Spatiotemporal Bandwidth Enhancement Filter by Sine-activated Deep Learning Model for Fast 3D Photoacoustic Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20575)
*I Gede Eka Sulistyawan,Takuro Ishii,Riku Suzuki,Yoshifumi Saijo*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a sine-activated deep learning model for improving 3D photoacoustic tomography by restoring broadband data in limited and bandlimited sensors, and demonstrates its effectiveness with qualitative and quantitative results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical constraints in 3D photoacoustic tomography, such as limited sensor density and bandlimited sampling rates, degrade image quality by losing structural details, motivating the need for novel approaches to recover sensor density and spatiotemporal bandwidth.

Method: The authors introduce a deep learning model with sine activation to restore broadband photoacoustic signals and simulate random spherical absorbers for training to prioritize bandwidth learning rather than dataset memorization.

Result: The proposed sine-activated model improved image quality across evaluations, enhancing vascular structures and minimizing artifacts, with quantitative benefits including higher contrast-to-noise ratios, full bandwidth restoration at -12 dB, and minimal structural similarity loss.

Conclusion: The sine-activated deep learning model effectively addresses limitations in 3D-PAT by enhancing high-frequency content and enabling faster imaging at 2 volumes-per-second, making it suitable for practical and dynamic applications.

Abstract: 3D photoacoustic tomography (3D-PAT) using high-frequency hemispherical
transducers offers near-omnidirectional reception and enhanced sensitivity to
the finer structural details encoded in the high-frequency components of the
broadband photoacoustic (PA) signal. However, practical constraints such as
limited number of channels with bandlimited sampling rate often result in
sparse and bandlimited sensors that degrade image quality. To address this, we
revisit the 2D deep learning (DL) approach applied directly to sensor-wise PA
radio-frequency (PARF) data. Specifically, we introduce sine activation into
the DL model to restore the broadband nature of PARF signals given the observed
band-limited and high-frequency PARF data. Given the scarcity of 3D training
data, we employ simplified training strategies by simulating random spherical
absorbers. This combination of sine-activated model and randomized training is
designed to emphasize bandwidth learning over dataset memorization. Our model
was evaluated on a leaf skeleton phantom, a micro-CT-verified 3D spiral phantom
and in-vivo human palm vasculature. The results showed that the proposed
training mechanism on sine-activated model was well-generalized across the
different tests by effectively increasing the sensor density and recovering the
spatiotemporal bandwidth. Qualitatively, the sine-activated model uniquely
enhanced high-frequency content that produces clearer vascular structure with
fewer artefacts. Quantitatively, the sine-activated model exhibits full
bandwidth at -12 dB spectrum and significantly higher contrast-to-noise ratio
with minimal loss of structural similarity index. Lastly, we optimized our
approach to enable fast enhanced 3D-PAT at 2 volumes-per-second for better
practical imaging of a free-moving targets.

*Davide Piccinini,Diego Valsesia,Enrico Magli*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Deep Pushbroom Super-Resolution (DPSR), a neural network for onboard satellite hyperspectral image super-resolution with real-time processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance spatial resolution of hyperspectral satellite images while enabling real-time onboard processing with lightweight methods.

Method: DPSR processes hyperspectral images line-by-line using a causal memory mechanism, optimized for low-power hardware to match real-time satellite acquisition speeds.

Result: DPSR achieves competitive or superior super-resolution image quality compared to state-of-the-art methods, with reduced computational complexity.

Conclusion: DPSR provides an efficient and effective solution for real-time onboard image enhancement, advancing practical deployment on satellite platforms.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imagers on satellites obtain the fine spectral signatures
essential for distinguishing one material from another at the expense of
limited spatial resolution. Enhancing the latter is thus a desirable
preprocessing step in order to further improve the detection capabilities
offered by hyperspectral images on downstream tasks. At the same time, there is
a growing interest towards deploying inference methods directly onboard of
satellites, which calls for lightweight image super-resolution methods that can
be run on the payload in real time. In this paper, we present a novel neural
network design, called Deep Pushbroom Super-Resolution (DPSR) that matches the
pushbroom acquisition of hyperspectral sensors by processing an image line by
line in the along-track direction with a causal memory mechanism to exploit
previously acquired lines. This design greatly limits memory requirements and
computational complexity, achieving onboard real-time performance, i.e., the
ability to super-resolve a line in the time it takes to acquire the next one,
on low-power hardware. Experiments show that the quality of the super-resolved
images is competitive or even outperforms state-of-the-art methods that are
significantly more complex.

### [561] [Do Not Mimic My Voice: Speaker Identity Unlearning for Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20140)
*Taesoo Kim,Jinju Kim,Dongchan Kim,Jong Hwan Ko,Gyeong-Moon Park*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper tackles the problem of removing unwanted speaker identities from Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech models by introducing unlearning frameworks, especially Teacher-Guided Unlearning (TGU), that ensure the model forgets designated voices while maintaining synthesis quality for others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address privacy and ethical concerns related to Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech systems, which can replicate voices from minimal audio cues, including the lack of methods to remove unwanted speaker identities from pre-trained models.

Method: Proposes unlearning frameworks, primarily Teacher-Guided Unlearning (TGU), which incorporates randomness and a novel evaluation metric called speaker-Zero Retrain Forgetting (spk-ZRF) to ensure pre-trained models forget designated speaker identities effectively.

Result: Experiments show that TGU effectively prevents the replication of unlearned voices while ensuring high-quality speech synthesis for other speakers.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully address speaker identity unlearning in Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech systems, offering a tool to remove unwanted voices from pre-trained models while preserving utility for other applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech (ZS-TTS) technology has
enabled high-fidelity voice synthesis from minimal audio cues, raising
significant privacy and ethical concerns. Despite the threats to voice privacy,
research to selectively remove the knowledge to replicate unwanted individual
voices from pre-trained model parameters has not been explored. In this paper,
we address the new challenge of speaker identity unlearning for ZS-TTS systems.
To meet this goal, we propose the first machine unlearning frameworks for
ZS-TTS, especially Teacher-Guided Unlearning (TGU), designed to ensure the
model forgets designated speaker identities while retaining its ability to
generate accurate speech for other speakers. Our proposed methods incorporate
randomness to prevent consistent replication of forget speakers' voices,
assuring unlearned identities remain untraceable. Additionally, we propose a
new evaluation metric, speaker-Zero Retrain Forgetting (spk-ZRF). This assesses
the model's ability to disregard prompts associated with forgotten speakers,
effectively neutralizing its knowledge of these voices. The experiments
conducted on the state-of-the-art model demonstrate that TGU prevents the model
from replicating forget speakers' voices while maintaining high quality for
other speakers. The demo is available at https://speechunlearn.github.io/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of computational inefficiency and limited accessibility in current music AI systems, making them suitable for real-time and resource-limited scenarios.

Method: A novel soft alignment attention mechanism was developed to capture multi-scale musical structures within the compressed latent space of a pre-trained variational autoencoder.

Result: The model achieved a 220x reduction in parameters and a 52x faster inference speed compared to state-of-the-art systems, outperforming OpenAI Jukebox in production quality and content unity.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight architecture makes AI-assisted music creation feasible on consumer hardware, broadening accessibility and enabling real-time interactive applications.

Abstract: We present a lightweight latent diffusion model for vocal-conditioned musical
accompaniment generation that addresses critical limitations in existing music
AI systems. Our approach introduces a novel soft alignment attention mechanism
that adaptively combines local and global temporal dependencies based on
diffusion timesteps, enabling efficient capture of multi-scale musical
structure. Operating in the compressed latent space of a pre-trained
variational autoencoder, the model achieves a 220 times parameter reduction
compared to state-of-the-art systems while delivering 52 times faster
inference. Experimental evaluation demonstrates competitive performance with
only 15M parameters, outperforming OpenAI Jukebox in production quality and
content unity while maintaining reasonable musical coherence. The
ultra-lightweight architecture enables real-time deployment on consumer
hardware, making AI-assisted music creation accessible for interactive
applications and resource-constrained environments.

*James Taylor,Wolfgang Mack*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Examines few-shot methods to improve audio classification accuracy over zero-shot methods by replacing noisy text embeddings with class-clustered audio embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in zero-shot audio classification, particularly the challenge of finding optimal, noise-free text descriptors for diverse audio classes.

Method: Investigates few-shot approaches where audio embeddings are grouped by class and used to replace noisy text embeddings in classification tasks.

Result: Few-shot methods are shown to generally achieve better classification accuracy than zero-shot methods.

Conclusion: Few-shot classification offers a viable improvement for audio classification tasks, suggesting its potential as an alternative to zero-shot methods.

Abstract: State-of-the-art audio classification often employs a zero-shot approach,
which involves comparing audio embeddings with embeddings from text describing
the respective audio class. These embeddings are usually generated by neural
networks trained through contrastive learning to align audio and text
representations. Identifying the optimal text description for an audio class is
challenging, particularly when the class comprises a wide variety of sounds.
This paper examines few-shot methods designed to improve classification
accuracy beyond the zero-shot approach. Specifically, audio embeddings are
grouped by class and processed to replace the inherently noisy text embeddings.
Our results demonstrate that few-shot classification typically outperforms the
zero-shot baseline.

*Nouhaila Fraihi,Ouassim Karrakchou,Mounir Ghogho*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces CNN-TSA, an integrated deep learning approach combining CNN with Temporal Self-Attention and Frequency Band Selection (FBS) for improved respiratory sound classification, achieving state-of-the-art results with reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing deep learning models in respiratory sound classification, where CNN models capture local features but struggle with global context, and transformer models handle long-range dependencies but are computationally intensive.

Method: The authors propose CNN-TSA, combining lightweight self-attention into a CNN backbone, and introduce a Frequency Band Selection (FBS) module to suppress non-informative frequency regions. They also develop age-specific models to enhance performance across diverse patient groups.

Result: CNN-TSA achieves new benchmarks on SPRSound datasets and state-of-the-art performance on ICBHI dataset, reducing computational costs by up to 50%, and FBS enhances transformer models further to set new records on ICBHI.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that CNN-TSA with FBS enables accurate and efficient respiratory sound analysis suitable for deployment in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Accurate classification of respiratory sounds requires deep learning models
that effectively capture fine-grained acoustic features and long-range temporal
dependencies. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are well-suited for
extracting local time-frequency patterns but are limited in modeling global
context. In contrast, transformer-based models can capture long-range
dependencies, albeit with higher computational demands. To address these
limitations, we propose a compact CNN-Temporal Self-Attention (CNN-TSA) network
that integrates lightweight self-attention into an efficient CNN backbone.
Central to our approach is a Frequency Band Selection (FBS) module that
suppresses noisy and non-informative frequency regions, substantially improving
accuracy and reducing FLOPs by up to 50%. We also introduce age-specific models
to enhance robustness across diverse patient groups. Evaluated on the
SPRSound-2022/2023 and ICBHI-2017 lung sound datasets, CNN-TSA with FBS sets
new benchmarks on SPRSound and achieves state-of-the-art performance on ICBHI,
all with a significantly smaller computational footprint. Furthermore,
integrating FBS into an existing transformer baseline yields a new record on
ICBHI, confirming FBS as an effective drop-in enhancement. These results
demonstrate that our framework enables reliable, real-time respiratory sound
analysis suitable for deployment in resource-constrained settings.

*Renhang Liu,Chia-Yu Hung,Navonil Majumder,Taylor Gautreaux,Amir Ali Bagherzadeh,Chuan Li,Dorien Herremans,Soujanya Poria*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces the JAM model, which aims to improve lyrics-to-song generation with word-level control and refined song quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current lyrics-to-song models lack fine-grained word-level control needed for professional workflows.

Method: The authors use flow-matching for word-level timing control and Direct Preference Optimization for improved song quality.

Result: JAM achieves word-level timing control and performs better in music-specific attributes compared to existing models.

Conclusion: JAM enhances creative audio generation, establishes evaluation benchmarks, and improves user alignment for lyrics-to-song modeling.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow-matching models have revolutionized automatic
text-to-audio generation in recent times. These models are increasingly capable
of generating high quality and faithful audio outputs capturing to speech and
acoustic events. However, there is still much room for improvement in creative
audio generation that primarily involves music and songs. Recent open
lyrics-to-song models, such as, DiffRhythm, ACE-Step, and LeVo, have set an
acceptable standard in automatic song generation for recreational use. However,
these models lack fine-grained word-level controllability often desired by
musicians in their workflows. To the best of our knowledge, our
flow-matching-based JAM is the first effort toward endowing word-level timing
and duration control in song generation, allowing fine-grained vocal control.
To enhance the quality of generated songs to better align with human
preferences, we implement aesthetic alignment through Direct Preference
Optimization, which iteratively refines the model using a synthetic dataset,
eliminating the need or manual data annotations. Furthermore, we aim to
standardize the evaluation of such lyrics-to-song models through our public
evaluation dataset JAME. We show that JAM outperforms the existing models in
terms of the music-specific attributes.

*Yonghyun Kim,Wayne Chi,Anastasios N. Angelopoulos,Wei-Lin Chiang,Koichi Saito,Shinji Watanabe,Yuki Mitsufuji,Chris Donahue*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Music Arena is an open platform allowing live human preference evaluation of text-to-music models through real-world user interactions and detailed feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current human preference evaluations in text-to-music systems are costly, inconsistent, and lack publicly available data, hindering progress and collaboration in the field.

Method: Music Arena facilitates text-to-music evaluation using real-world prompts, system comparisons, and collected listening data and feedback via a platform incorporating music-specific features like LLM-based routing and privacy-conscious data release policies.

Result: The platform compiles user preferences into a leaderboard, enabling standardized evaluation, renewable preference data collection, and enhanced transparency in the evaluation process.

Conclusion: Music Arena addresses critical gaps in text-to-music model evaluation standards, offering scalable, transparent, and music-specific solutions usable throughout the AI research community.

Abstract: We present Music Arena, an open platform for scalable human preference
evaluation of text-to-music (TTM) models. Soliciting human preferences via
listening studies is the gold standard for evaluation in TTM, but these studies
are expensive to conduct and difficult to compare, as study protocols may
differ across systems. Moreover, human preferences might help researchers align
their TTM systems or improve automatic evaluation metrics, but an open and
renewable source of preferences does not currently exist. We aim to fill these
gaps by offering *live* evaluation for TTM. In Music Arena, real-world users
input text prompts of their choosing and compare outputs from two TTM systems,
and their preferences are used to compile a leaderboard. While Music Arena
follows recent evaluation trends in other AI domains, we also design it with
key features tailored to music: an LLM-based routing system to navigate the
heterogeneous type signatures of TTM systems, and the collection of *detailed*
preferences including listening data and natural language feedback. We also
propose a rolling data release policy with user privacy guarantees, providing a
renewable source of preference data and increasing platform transparency.
Through its standardized evaluation protocol, transparent data access policies,
and music-specific features, Music Arena not only addresses key challenges in
the TTM ecosystem but also demonstrates how live evaluation can be thoughtfully
adapted to unique characteristics of specific AI domains.

*Junxian Wu,Weitao You,Heda Zuo,Dengming Zhang,Pei Chen,Lingyun Sun*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel video-to-music (V2M) generation framework that addresses limitations in control and alignment by integrating multiple time-varying conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current V2M methods generate music in a black-box style with limited control and often fail to meet user expectations.

Method: A two-stage training strategy is employed: Stage 1 focuses on feature alignment with a fine-grained feature selection module and progressive temporal alignment attention; Stage 2 integrates multi-condition inputs with a dynamic conditional fusion module and control-guided decoding.

Result: Experiments confirm that the proposed framework improves control and alignment with user expectations, outperforming current V2M methods both subjectively and objectively.

Conclusion: The method enhances the quality and controllability of V2M generation, addressing the black-box nature of previous techniques and offering improved user satisfaction.

Abstract: Music enhances video narratives and emotions, driving demand for automatic
video-to-music (V2M) generation. However, existing V2M methods relying solely
on visual features or supplementary textual inputs generate music in a
black-box manner, often failing to meet user expectations. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel multi-condition guided V2M generation framework
that incorporates multiple time-varying conditions for enhanced control over
music generation. Our method uses a two-stage training strategy that enables
learning of V2M fundamentals and audiovisual temporal synchronization while
meeting users' needs for multi-condition control. In the first stage, we
introduce a fine-grained feature selection module and a progressive temporal
alignment attention mechanism to ensure flexible feature alignment. For the
second stage, we develop a dynamic conditional fusion module and a
control-guided decoder module to integrate multiple conditions and accurately
guide the music composition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing V2M pipelines in both subjective and objective
evaluations, significantly enhancing control and alignment with user
expectations.

*MohammadHossein Bateni,Laxman Dhulipala,Willem Fletcher,Kishen N Gowda,D Ellis Hershkowitz,Rajesh Jayaram,Jakub Łącki*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper presents efficient parallel algorithms for approximate Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) in low dimensions with certain non-monotone linkage functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parallel algorithms for approximate HAC are limited to monotone linkage functions, leaving a gap for non-monotone functions like centroid and Ward's distance, which are widely used but lack parallel processing methods.

Method: The researchers introduced NC algorithms for $(1+ε)$-approximate HAC using a novel structural result, which ensures a poly(log n) hierarchy height for the considered linkage functions in low dimensions.

Result: The proposed algorithms efficiently compute approximate HAC for non-monotone linkages in low dimensions. Moreover, it is shown that parallel algorithms for arbitrary dimensional HAC with these linkage functions are CC-hard, implying their unlikelihood.

Conclusion: The study fills a critical gap in parallel HAC algorithms for non-monotone linkage functions in low dimensions, while also establishing computational limits in higher dimensions.

Abstract: Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) is an extensively studied and
widely used method for hierarchical clustering in $\mathbb{R}^k$ based on
repeatedly merging the closest pair of clusters according to an input linkage
function $d$. Highly parallel (i.e., NC) algorithms are known for
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate HAC (where near-minimum rather than minimum pairs
are merged) for certain linkage functions that monotonically increase as merges
are performed. However, no such algorithms are known for many important but
non-monotone linkage functions such as centroid and Ward's linkage.
  In this work, we show that a general class of non-monotone linkage functions
-- which include centroid and Ward's distance -- admit efficient NC algorithms
for $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate HAC in low dimensions. Our algorithms are based
on a structural result which may be of independent interest: the height of the
hierarchy resulting from any constant-approximate HAC on $n$ points for this
class of linkage functions is at most $\operatorname{poly}(\log n)$ as long as
$k = O(\log \log n / \log \log \log n)$. Complementing our upper bounds, we
show that NC algorithms for HAC with these linkage functions in
\emph{arbitrary} dimensions are unlikely to exist by showing that HAC is
CC-hard when $d$ is centroid distance and $k = n$.

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework called Iterative Pretraining for Interatomic Potentials (IPIP) to improve machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) by combining iterative refinement and a forgetting mechanism. Results show significant performance gains in accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLIPs require large labeled datasets and general-purpose pretraining models often fail to specialize, causing inefficiencies in highly specific physical science simulations.

Method: IPIP iteratively improves MLIP models using a forgetting mechanism to avoid suboptimal convergence, leveraging lightweight architectures for better system-specific accuracy.

Result: The IPIP framework reduces prediction error by more than 80% and achieves up to 4x speedup in simulations for the Mo-S-O system.

Conclusion: IPIP offers a specialized, efficient, and accurate alternative to general-purpose pretraining models, addressing limitations in current approaches and enhancing molecular dynamics simulations.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable efficient molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations with ab initio accuracy and have been applied across
various domains in physical science. However, their performance often relies on
large-scale labeled training data. While existing pretraining strategies can
improve model performance, they often suffer from a mismatch between the
objectives of pretraining and downstream tasks or rely on extensive labeled
datasets and increasingly complex architectures to achieve broad
generalization. To address these challenges, we propose Iterative Pretraining
for Interatomic Potentials (IPIP), a framework designed to iteratively improve
the predictive performance of MLIP models. IPIP incorporates a forgetting
mechanism to prevent iterative training from converging to suboptimal local
minima. Unlike general-purpose foundation models, which frequently underperform
on specialized tasks due to a trade-off between generality and system-specific
accuracy, IPIP achieves higher accuracy and efficiency using lightweight
architectures. Compared to general-purpose force fields, this approach achieves
over 80% reduction in prediction error and up to 4x speedup in the challenging
Mo-S-O system, enabling fast and accurate simulations.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper introduces ACCESS-AV, a Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) localization system for Autonomous Delivery Vehicles (ADVs) utilizing 5G infrastructure to improve energy efficiency and reduce costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing use of ADVs in 5G-enabled smart factories necessitates optimizing the compute-intensive localization module for energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

Method: ACCESS-AV leverages existing 5G Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs) for localization, using an optimized Angle-of-Arrival (AoA)-based MUSIC algorithm. The framework employs an adaptive strategy to balance energy consumption and localization accuracy based on environmental factors.

Result: The proposed system delivers a 43.09% reduction in energy consumption compared to conventional AoA methods and achieves sub-30 cm localization accuracy while lowering infrastructure and operational costs.

Conclusion: ACCESS-AV offers a viable and sustainable solution for ADV localization in smart factories, emphasizing energy efficiency, accuracy, and cost reduction through opportunistic use of 5G infrastructure.

Abstract: Autonomous Delivery Vehicles (ADVs) are increasingly used for transporting
goods in 5G network-enabled smart factories, with the compute-intensive
localization module presenting a significant opportunity for optimization. We
propose ACCESS-AV, an energy-efficient Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)
localization framework that leverages existing 5G infrastructure in smart
factory environments. By opportunistically accessing the periodically broadcast
5G Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs) for localization, ACCESS-AV obviates
the need for dedicated Roadside Units (RSUs) or additional onboard sensors to
achieve energy efficiency as well as cost reduction. We implement an
Angle-of-Arrival (AoA)-based estimation method using the Multiple Signal
Classification (MUSIC) algorithm, optimized for resource-constrained ADV
platforms through an adaptive communication-computation strategy that
dynamically balances energy consumption with localization accuracy based on
environmental conditions such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and vehicle
velocity. Experimental results demonstrate that ACCESS-AV achieves an average
energy reduction of 43.09% compared to non-adaptive systems employing AoA
algorithms such as vanilla MUSIC, ESPRIT, and Root-MUSIC. It maintains sub-30
cm localization accuracy while also delivering substantial reductions in
infrastructure and operational costs, establishing its viability for
sustainable smart factory environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a vision-based cooperative localization system for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) to ensure reliable positioning in urban areas with unreliable GNSS signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring precise localization for CAVs in GNSS-compromised urban environments, particularly in occlusion-heavy scenarios.

Method: A decentralized observer is developed that integrates onboard cameras, V2X communication, and relative measurements between vehicles and landmarks to accurately estimate vehicle poses.

Result: The approach is evaluated using experiments with real miniature connected vehicles and large-scale simulations, proving its scalability and confirming theoretical guarantees for pose estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed decentralized observer enables accurate and robust localization for CAVs even in complex and occlusion-heavy environments, ensuring safer operation in urban settings.

Abstract: Accurate and robust localization is critical for the safe operation of
Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), especially in complex urban
environments where Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are
unreliable. This paper presents a novel vision-based cooperative localization
algorithm that leverages onboard cameras and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
communication to enable CAVs to estimate their poses, even in occlusion-heavy
scenarios such as busy intersections. In particular, we propose a novel
decentralized observer for a group of connected agents that includes landmark
agents (static or moving) in the environment with known positions and vehicle
agents that need to estimate their poses (both positions and orientations).
Assuming that (i) there are at least three landmark agents in the environment,
(ii) each vehicle agent can measure its own angular and translational
velocities as well as relative bearings to at least three neighboring landmarks
or vehicles, and (iii) neighboring vehicles can communicate their pose
estimates, each vehicle can estimate its own pose using the proposed
decentralized observer. We prove that the origin of the estimation error is
locally exponentially stable under the proposed observer, provided that the
minimal observability conditions are satisfied. Moreover, we evaluate the
proposed approach through experiments with real 1/10th-scale connected vehicles
and large-scale simulations, demonstrating its scalability and validating the
theoretical guarantees in practical scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper compares behavioral cloning (BC) and reinforcement learning (RL) methodologies for training guidance and control networks (G&CNETs) in spacecraft trajectory optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of direct comparisons between BC and RL in G&CNET training literature and explore their efficiencies in deterministic and stochastic scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces a novel RL training framework with tailored mechanisms like decoupled action/control frequencies and reward redistribution. Systematic evaluations between BC and RL approaches are conducted.

Result: BC-trained G&CNETs excel in replicating expert policy behavior under deterministic environments but are limited by dataset quality. RL-trained G&CNETs exhibit adaptability in stochastic conditions and can uncover globally optimal strategies beyond suboptimal expert demonstrations.

Conclusion: BC is ideal for deterministic settings with high-quality datasets, while RL shows superior flexibility and the potential to optimize beyond expert demonstrations, especially under stochastic conditions.

Abstract: Guidance & control networks (G&CNETs) provide a promising alternative to
on-board guidance and control (G&C) architectures for spacecraft, offering a
differentiable, end-to-end representation of the guidance and control
architecture. When training G&CNETs, two predominant paradigms emerge:
behavioural cloning (BC), which mimics optimal trajectories, and reinforcement
learning (RL), which learns optimal behaviour through trials and errors.
Although both approaches have been adopted in G&CNET related literature, direct
comparisons are notably absent. To address this, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of BC and RL specifically for training G&CNETs on continuous-thrust
spacecraft trajectory optimisation tasks. We introduce a novel RL training
framework tailored to G&CNETs, incorporating decoupled action and control
frequencies alongside reward redistribution strategies to stabilise training
and to provide a fair comparison. Our results show that BC-trained G&CNETs
excel at closely replicating expert policy behaviour, and thus the optimal
control structure of a deterministic environment, but can be negatively
constrained by the quality and coverage of the training dataset. In contrast
RL-trained G&CNETs, beyond demonstrating a superior adaptability to stochastic
conditions, can also discover solutions that improve upon suboptimal expert
demonstrations, sometimes revealing globally optimal strategies that eluded the
generation of training samples.

*Wei Lu,Daniel L. Chen,Christian B. Hansen*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: This paper examines how large language models (LLMs) behave in economic games, finding significant behavioral deviations from humans and proposing a fine-tuning approach to align models with specific economic preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs participate more autonomously in critical decisions, there is a need to understand and guide their strategic behaviors, which have substantial economic and moral consequences.

Method: The paper evaluates LLMs in economic games, contrasts their behaviors with human strategies, and introduces a supervised fine-tuning technique using synthetic datasets to align models with specific preference structures based on homo economicus and homo moralis frameworks.

Result: The fine-tuning successfully shifts LLM behavior toward corresponding economic agent preferences and demonstrates its impact in moral dilemmas and competitive market pricing.

Conclusion: This work offers a systematic, replicable, and resource-efficient method to align LLM behaviors with economic and moral principles, thereby enhancing their utility in socially and economically sensitive applications.

Abstract: Understanding how large language model (LLM) agents behave in strategic
interactions is essential as these systems increasingly participate
autonomously in economically and morally consequential decisions. We evaluate
LLM preferences using canonical economic games, finding substantial deviations
from human behavior. Models like GPT-4o show excessive cooperation and limited
incentive sensitivity, while reasoning models, such as o3-mini, align more
consistently with payoff-maximizing strategies. We propose a supervised
fine-tuning pipeline that uses synthetic datasets derived from economic
reasoning to align LLM agents with economic preferences, focusing on two
stylized preference structures. In the first, utility depends only on
individual payoffs (homo economicus), while utility also depends on a notion of
Kantian universalizability in the second preference structure (homo moralis).
We find that fine-tuning based on small datasets shifts LLM agent behavior
toward the corresponding economic agent. We further assess the fine-tuned
agents' behavior in two applications: Moral dilemmas involving autonomous
vehicles and algorithmic pricing in competitive markets. These examples
illustrate how different normative objectives embedded via realizations from
structured preference structures can influence market and moral outcomes. This
work contributes a replicable, cost-efficient, and economically grounded
pipeline to align AI preferences using moral-economic principles.

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: This paper develops an identifiable framework considering non-convex uncertainty in stochastic calculus, introducing $\\theta$-BSDE, a novel class of backward stochastic differential equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stochastic calculus frameworks are inadequate to address non-convex uncertainty, creating identifiability challenges.

Method: The paper introduces $\\theta$-BSDE with a driver determined by pointwise maximization over potentially non-convex sets, leveraging Lipschitz conditions and fixed-point arguments for well-posedness.

Result: Establishes well-posedness, shows pathwise maximizer uniqueness under Malliavin calculus assumptions, and connects the valuation operator to fully nonlinear PDEs.

Conclusion: The framework overcomes canonical theory's limitations, enabling dynamically consistent expectations under non-convex uncertainty with links to PDE theory.

Abstract: The canonical theory of stochastic calculus under ambiguity, founded on
sub-additivity, is insensitive to non-convex uncertainty structures, leading to
an identifiability impasse. This paper develops a mathematical framework for an
identifiable calculus sensitive to non-convex geometry. We introduce the
$\theta$-BSDE, a class of backward stochastic differential equations where the
driver is determined by a pointwise maximization over a primitive, possibly
non-convex, uncertainty set. The system's tractability is predicated not on
convexity, but on a global analytic hypothesis: the existence of a unique and
globally Lipschitz maximizer map for the driver function. Under this
hypothesis, which carves out a tractable class of models, we establish
well-posedness via a fixed-point argument. For a distinct, geometrically
regular class of models, we prove a result of independent interest: under
non-degeneracy conditions from Malliavin calculus, the maximizer is unique
along any solution path, ensuring the model's internal consistency. We clarify
the fundamental logical gap between this pathwise property and the global
regularity required by our existence proof. The resulting valuation operator
defines a dynamically consistent expectation, and we establish its connection
to fully nonlinear PDEs via a Feynman-Kac formula.

### [575] [A note on the Artstein-Avidan-Milman's generalized Legendre transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20577)
*Frank Nielsen*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper builds on prior work to show that generalized Legendre transforms correspond to ordinary Legendre transforms applied to affine-deformed functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between generalized and ordinary Legendre transforms in the context of convex functions and affine deformations.

Method: The authors prove that generalized Legendre transforms relate directly to ordinary Legendre transforms of affine-deformed functions and discuss implications in information geometry.

Result: Generalized convex conjugates are proven to be convex conjugates of specific affine-deformed functions.

Conclusion: The results connect the generalized Legendre transform with the framework of information geometry, emphasizing the role of affine deformations.

Abstract: Artstein-Avidan and Milman [Annals of mathematics (2009), (169):661-674]
characterized invertible reverse-ordering transforms on the space of
lower-semi-continuous extended real-valued convex functions as affine
deformations of the ordinary Legendre transform. In this note, we prove that
all those generalized Legendre transforms on functions correspond to the
ordinary Legendre transform on dually corresponding affine-deformed functions.
That is, generalized convex conjugates are convex conjugates of affine-deformed
functions. We conclude this note by sketching how this result can be
interpreted from the lens of information geometry.

### [576] [Handoff Design in User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks Using DRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20966)
*Hussein A. Ammar,Raviraj Adve,Shahram Shahbazpanahi,Gary Boudreau,Israfil Bahceci*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper discusses using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a continuous action space to manage handoffs (HOs) in user-centric massive MIMO networks, reducing overhead and maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address frequent handoff overhead challenges in user-centric massive MIMO networks caused by user mobility.

Method: A DRL-based approach using the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm with two observation variants: mobility direction-assisted (DA) and history-assisted (HA).

Result: Simulation results indicate improved scalability, minimized HO overhead through optimized timing, and real-time operation capability (<0.4 ms response time).

Conclusion: The DRL-based solution efficiently manages handoffs, balancing performance and overhead while maintaining real-time responsiveness.

Abstract: In the user-centric cell-free massive MIMO (UC-mMIMO) network scheme, user
mobility necessitates updating the set of serving access points to maintain the
user-centric clustering. Such updates are typically performed through handoff
(HO) operations; however, frequent HOs lead to overheads associated with the
allocation and release of resources. This paper presents a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL)-based solution to predict and manage these connections for
mobile users. Our solution employs the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, with
continuous action space representation, to train a deep neural network to serve
as the HO policy. We present a novel proposition for a reward function that
integrates a HO penalty in order to balance the attainable rate and the
associated overhead related to HOs. We develop two variants of our system; the
first one uses mobility direction-assisted (DA) observations that are based on
the user movement pattern, while the second one uses history-assisted (HA)
observations that are based on the history of the large-scale fading (LSF).
Simulation results show that our DRL-based continuous action space approach is
more scalable than discrete space counterpart, and that our derived HO policy
automatically learns to gather HOs in specific time slots to minimize the
overhead of initiating HOs. Our solution can also operate in real time with a
response time less than 0.4 ms.

### [577] [Accelerating Deterministic Global Optimization via GPU-parallel Interval Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20769)
*Hongzhen Zhang,Tim Kerkenhoff,Neil Kichler,Manuel Dahmen,Alexander Mitsos,Uwe Naumann,Dominik Bongartz*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a GPU-parallelized spatial Branch and Bound (B&B) algorithm that substantially speeds up nonconvex problem solving compared to CPU-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational expense of global optimization for nonconvex problems using Branch and Bound algorithms through improved hardware utilization, with a focus on GPU parallelization.

Method: Spatial B&B is enhanced with GPU parallelism using Mean Value Form for calculating interval bounds across partitioned subdomains. Implementation includes CUDA kernel and CUDA graph approaches.

Result: The proposed GPU method achieves three orders of magnitude speedup in computation compared to CPU-based methods, with tighter bounds requiring fewer B&B iterations, and performs competitively compared to traditional solvers.

Conclusion: GPU-accelerated spatial B&B techniques show substantial promise in improving the efficiency of global optimization for nonconvex problems.

Abstract: Spatial Branch and Bound (B&B) algorithms are widely used for solving
nonconvex problems to global optimality, yet they remain computationally
expensive. Though some works have been carried out to speed up B&B via CPU
parallelization, GPU parallelization is much less explored. In this work, we
investigate the design of a spatial B&B algorithm that involves an
interval-based GPU-parallel lower bounding solver: The domain of each B&B node
is temporarily partitioned into numerous subdomains, then massive GPU
parallelism is leveraged to compute interval bounds of the objective function
and constraints on each subdomain, using the Mean Value Form. The resulting
bounds are tighter than those achieved via regular interval arithmetic without
partitioning, but they remain fast to compute. We implement the method into our
open-source solver MAiNGO via CUDA in two manners: wrapping all GPU tasks
within one kernel function, or distributing the GPU tasks onto a CUDA graph.
Numerical experiments show that using more subdomains leads to significantly
tighter lower bounds and thus less B&B iterations. Regarding wall clock time,
the proposed spatial B&B framework achieves a speedup of three orders of
magnitude compared to applying interval arithmetic on the CPU without domain
partitioning. Among the two implementations, the one developed with CUDA graph
enables higher efficiency. Moreover, in some case studies, the proposed method
delivers competitive or better performance compared to MAiNGO's default solver
which is based on McCormick relaxations. These results highlight the potential
of GPU-accelerated bounding techniques to accelerate B&B algorithms.

### [578] [Ultracoarse Equilibria and Ordinal-Folding Dynamics in Operator-Algebraic Models of Infinite Multi-Agent Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19694)
*Faruk Alpay,Hamdi Alakkad,Bugra Kilictas,Taylan Alpay*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a mathematical framework for infinite games with continuum agents, providing convergence conditions, a unique equilibrium, and tools for analyzing large systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a rigorous operator algebraic framework for infinite games and provide insights into strategy evolution, convergence, and applications in large-scale systems like multi-agent economies and language models.

Method: The authors use von Neumann algebras to model collective strategy evolution and introduce a reflective regret operator, driving strategy distributions toward equilibrium. They also define an ordinal folding index to measure dynamics' complexity.

Result: The framework proves convergence to a unique equilibrium under mild assumptions, characterizes envy-free allocations, and establishes rigidity results. It also connects regret flow properties to real-world stability phenomena in large models.

Conclusion: This theory advances mathematical tools for multi-agent systems, bridging functional analysis and game theory, and offers practical insights into equilibrium behavior and system stability.

Abstract: We develop an operator algebraic framework for infinite games with a
continuum of agents and prove that regret based learning dynamics governed by a
noncommutative continuity equation converge to a unique quantal response
equilibrium under mild regularity assumptions. The framework unifies functional
analysis, coarse geometry and game theory by assigning to every game a von
Neumann algebra that represents collective strategy evolution. A reflective
regret operator within this algebra drives the flow of strategy distributions
and its fixed point characterises equilibrium. We introduce the ordinal folding
index, a computable ordinal valued metric that measures the self referential
depth of the dynamics, and show that it bounds the transfinite time needed for
convergence, collapsing to zero on coarsely amenable networks. The theory
yields new invariant subalgebra rigidity results, establishes existence and
uniqueness of envy free and maximin share allocations in continuum economies,
and links analytic properties of regret flows with empirical stability
phenomena in large language models. These contributions supply a rigorous
mathematical foundation for large scale multi agent systems and demonstrate the
utility of ordinal metrics for equilibrium selection.

### [579] [Nonconvex Optimization Framework for Group-Sparse Feedback Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control. II: Non-Penalty Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19895)
*Lechen Feng,Xun Li,Yuan-Hua Ni*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper addresses the sparse feedback LQ problem (SF-LQ) and distributed fixed-topology LQ (DFT-LQ), avoiding penalty method drawbacks by reformulating the problem and analyzing the ADMM for direct solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to improve the resolution of the SF-LQ and DFT-LQ problems, addressing limitations of penalty approaches like parameter tuning difficulties and spurious solutions.

Method: The authors reformulate the problem using an epi-composition perspective, analyze the ADMM for convergence, and incorporate subgradient descent with Difference-of-Convex relaxation when required.

Result: The study demonstrates that these methods facilitate direct design of group-sparse feedback gains with theoretical guarantees, avoiding common limitations of penalty-based approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide a more robust alternative for solving SF-LQ and DFT-LQ problems, bypassing restrictive approximations and achieving theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: This work is a companion paper of [8], where the distributed linear-quadratic
problem with fixed communication topology (DFT-LQ) and the sparse feedback LQ
problem (SF-LQ) are formulated into a nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization
problem with affine constraints. Moreover, a penalty approach is considered in
\cite{feng-part1}, and the PALM (proximal alternating linearized minimization)
algorithm is studied with convergence and complexity analysis. In this paper,
we aim to address the inherent drawbacks of the penalty approach, such as the
challenge of tuning the penalty parameter and the risk of introducing spurious
stationary points. Specifically, we first reformulate the SF-LQ problem and the
DFT-LQ problem from an epi-composition function perspective, aiming to solve
the constrained problem directly. Then, from a theoretical viewpoint, we
revisit the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and establish
its convergence to the set of cluster points under certain assumptions. When
these assumptions do not hold, we can effectively utilize alternative
approaches combining subgradient descent with Difference-of-Convex relaxation
methods. In summary, our results enable the direct design of group-sparse
feedback gains with theoretical guarantees, without resorting to convex
surrogates, restrictive structural assumptions, or penalty formulations that
incorporate constraints into the cost function.

### [580] [Mean-Field Langevin Diffusions with Density-dependent Temperature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20958)
*Yu-Jui Huang,Zachariah Malik*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Langevin diffusion method with density-dependent temperature, forming a unique mean-field stochastic differential equation (SDE). It provides mathematical results on the existence, uniqueness, and long-term behavior of this system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle challenges in non-convex optimization by introducing location-based random perturbations that adapt dynamically to the landscape of the function being minimized.

Method: Introduced Langevin dynamics regulated by its own density, leading to a Nemytskii-type mean-field SDE. Used Wasserstein calculus to prove uniqueness of the Fokker-Planck equation and Trevisan's superposition principle for constructing SDE solutions.

Result: The method forms a unique weak solution of SDEs, and the induced density converges to an invariant distribution over time, described via the Lambert $W$ function.

Conclusion: The approach offers a mathematically sound framework for enhancing Langevin diffusion in non-convex optimization, with robust theoretical guarantees on long-term density behavior.

Abstract: In the context of non-convex optimization, we let the temperature of a
Langevin diffusion to depend on the diffusion's own density function. The
rationale is that the induced density reveals to some extent the landscape
imposed by the non-convex function to be minimized, such that a
density-dependent temperature can provide location-wise random perturbation
that may better react to, for instance, the location and depth of local
minimizers. As the Langevin dynamics is now self-regulated by its own density,
it forms a mean-field stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the Nemytskii
type, distinct from the standard McKean-Vlasov equations. Relying on
Wasserstein subdifferential calculus, we first show that the corresponding
(nonlinear) Fokker-Planck equation has a unique solution. Next, a weak solution
to the SDE is constructed from the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation, by
Trevisan's superposition principle. As time goes to infinity, we further show
that the density induced by the SDE converges to an invariant distribution,
which admits an explicit formula in terms of the Lambert $W$ function.

*Brady K. Zhou,Jason J. Hu,Jane K. J. Lee,Z. Hong Zhou,Demetri Terzopoulos*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This review examines how AI, particularly deep learning, enhances cryoEM and cryoET workflows, improving tasks like noise reduction, particle picking, and atomic model building.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address longstanding challenges in cryogenic electron microscopy pipelines, such as low signal-to-noise ratios and orientation artifacts, through integration of advanced AI methods.

Method: AI tools, including convolutional neural networks, U-Net architectures, and large language models, are deployed for automated tasks across the cryoEM and cryoET pipelines, such as denoising, artifact correction, and model building.

Result: AI approaches enabled near-atomic resolution reconstructions, automated pipelines with minimal manual intervention, and successful structure determination for complex biological systems.

Conclusion: Deep learning integration into cryoEM and cryoET workflows enhances efficiency, scalability, and accessibility in structural biology, paving the way for novel insights into macromolecular architecture.

Abstract: The past decade's "cryoEM revolution" has produced exponential growth in
high-resolution structural data through advances in cryogenic electron
microscopy (cryoEM) and tomography (cryoET). Deep learning integration into
structural proteomics workflows addresses longstanding challenges including low
signal-to-noise ratios, preferred orientation artifacts, and missing-wedge
problems that historically limited efficiency and scalability. This review
examines AI applications across the entire cryoEM pipeline, from automated
particle picking using convolutional neural networks (Topaz, crYOLO,
CryoSegNet) to computational solutions for preferred orientation bias
(spIsoNet, cryoPROS) and advanced denoising algorithms (Topaz-Denoise). In
cryoET, tools like IsoNet employ U-Net architectures for simultaneous
missing-wedge correction and noise reduction, while TomoNet streamlines
subtomogram averaging through AI-driven particle detection. The workflow
culminates with automated atomic model building using sophisticated tools like
ModelAngelo, DeepTracer, and CryoREAD that translate density maps into
interpretable biological structures. These AI-enhanced approaches have achieved
near-atomic resolution reconstructions with minimal manual intervention,
resolved previously intractable datasets suffering from severe orientation
bias, and enabled successful application to diverse biological systems from HIV
virus-like particles to in situ ribosomal complexes. As deep learning evolves,
particularly with large language models and vision transformers, the future
promises sophisticated automation and accessibility in structural biology,
potentially revolutionizing our understanding of macromolecular architecture
and function.

### [582] [Enhancing Materials Discovery with Valence Constrained Design in Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19799)
*Mouyang Cheng,Weiliang Luo,Hao Tang,Bowen Yu,Yongqiang Cheng,Weiwei Xie,Ju Li,Heather J. Kulik,Mingda Li*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The paper introduces CrysVCD, a deep generative framework with chemical valence constraints for generating crystal structures efficiently and with high stability metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many current diffusion-based generative models for material design fail to account for critical chemical constraints, such as oxidation state balance, resulting in chemically invalid outputs.

Method: CrysVCD incorporates a transformer-based language model for generating valence-correct compositions and a diffusion model for crystal structure generation. It enforces valence constraints within the design process for chemical validity and efficiency.

Result: CrysVCD achieves high chemical validity by reducing computational costs in valence checking and demonstrates 85% thermodynamic stability and 68% phonon stability. It also successfully generates functional materials with desired properties.

Conclusion: CrysVCD offers a reliable and modular tool for chemically valid material discovery, with wide applications in functional material design through its integration into existing generative pipelines.

Abstract: Diffusion-based deep generative models have emerged as powerful tools for
inverse materials design. Yet, many existing approaches overlook essential
chemical constraints such as oxidation state balance, which can lead to
chemically invalid structures. Here we introduce CrysVCD (Crystal generator
with Valence-Constrained Design), a modular framework that integrates chemical
rules directly into the generative process. CrysVCD first employs a
transformer-based elemental language model to generate valence-balanced
compositions, followed by a diffusion model to generate crystal structures. The
valence constraint enables orders-of-magnitude more efficient chemical valence
checking, compared to pure data-driven approaches with post-screening. When
fine-tuned on stability metrics, CrysVCD achieves 85% thermodynamic stability
and 68% phonon stability. Moreover, CrysVCD supports conditional generation of
functional materials, enabling discovery of candidates such as high thermal
conductivity semiconductors and high-$\kappa$ dielectric compounds. Designed as
a general-purpose plugin, CrysVCD can be integrated into diverse generative
pipeline to promote chemical validity, offering a reliable, scientifically
grounded path for materials discovery.

*Jesco Talies,Eric Breitbarth,David Melching*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework called attention-guided training, which uses explainable AI and domain-specific feedback to enhance generalization and faithful model explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of ensuring trustworthiness and robustness in deep learning models, particularly in critical scientific applications.

Method: The proposed framework uses explainable AI techniques combined with domain-specific priors and quantitative evaluation to guide model attention during training.

Result: The framework improves generalization and provides more physically meaningful model explanations, validated on semantic crack tip segmentation in digital image correlation data.

Conclusion: Attention-guided training effectively aligns model focus with physically relevant regions, enhancing both its performance and explanation fidelity.

Abstract: Ensuring the trustworthiness and robustness of deep learning models remains a
fundamental challenge, particularly in high-stakes scientific applications. In
this study, we present a framework called attention-guided training that
combines explainable artificial intelligence techniques with quantitative
evaluation and domain-specific priors to guide model attention. We demonstrate
that domain specific feedback on model explanations during training can enhance
the model's generalization capabilities. We validate our approach on the task
of semantic crack tip segmentation in digital image correlation data which is a
key application in the fracture mechanical characterization of materials. By
aligning model attention with physically meaningful stress fields, such as
those described by Williams' analytical solution, attention-guided training
ensures that the model focuses on physically relevant regions. This finally
leads to improved generalization and more faithful explanations.

*Yannis Smaragdakis,Neville Grech,Sifis Lagouvardos,Konstantinos Triantafyllou,Ilias Tsatiris,Yannis Bollanos,Tony Rocco Valentine*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper discusses techniques for automatically detecting high-value vulnerabilities in smart contracts, having achieved over $3 million in bug bounties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the belief that automated techniques are only suitable for detecting minor vulnerabilities in blockchain systems and demonstrate their effectiveness in identifying high-value vulnerabilities.

Method: Combines high-completeness static analysis with domain knowledge, the latter being inferred either manually by experts or automatically using statistical analysis on a large corpus of deployed contracts.

Result: The techniques have successfully identified high-value vulnerabilities, leading to 10 disclosed bugs worth over $3M and hundreds of other bugs in under-audit or pre-deployment code.

Conclusion: High-value vulnerabilities can be detected automatically by prioritizing strategies with low false-negative rates, even at the cost of high false-positive rates, as long as the flagged cases deliver meaningful insights.

Abstract: A widespread belief in the blockchain security community is that automated
techniques are only good for detecting shallow bugs, typically of small value.
In this paper, we present the techniques and insights that have led us to
repeatable success in automatically discovering high-value smart contract
vulnerabilities. Our vulnerability disclosures have yielded 10 bug bounties,
for a total of over $3M, over high-profile deployed code, as well as hundreds
of bugs detected in pre-deployment or under-audit code.
  We argue that the elements of this surprising success are a) a very
high-completeness static analysis approach that manages to maintain acceptable
precision; b) domain knowledge, provided by experts or captured via statistical
inference. We present novel techniques for automatically inferring domain
knowledge from statistical analysis of a large corpus of deployed contracts, as
well as discuss insights on the ideal precision and warning rate of a promising
vulnerability detector. In contrast to academic literature in program analysis,
which routinely expects false-positive rates below 50% for publishable results,
we posit that a useful analysis for high-value real-world vulnerabilities will
likely flag very few programs (under 1%) and will do so with a high
false-positive rate (e.g., 95%, meaning that only one-of-twenty human
inspections will yield an exploitable vulnerability).

*Nicola Croce,Tobin South*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper highlights security vulnerabilities in the Model Context Protocol (MCP), demonstrating how basic programming skills can be used to exploit trust between AI agents and external services for malicious purposes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the security flaws in MCP that allow unsophisticated threat actors to exploit the protocol for malicious activities, particularly impacting sensitive financial data.

Method: The authors used a proof-of-concept malicious weather MCP server to demonstrate how legitimate banking tools can be exploited to steal financial data, emphasizing the simplicity of execution and the minimal resources required.

Result: The authors revealed significant security gaps in MCP systems, showing that the trust model facilitates trivial cross-server attacks, emphasizing the low technical barrier for exploitation.

Conclusion: Current MCP implementations are vulnerable to trivial cross-server attacks. Immediate mitigations and protocol improvements are necessary to secure the MCP ecosystem and prevent exploitation by unsophisticated adversaries.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) represents a significant advancement in
AI-tool integration, enabling seamless communication between AI agents and
external services. However, this connectivity introduces novel attack vectors
that remain largely unexplored. This paper demonstrates how unsophisticated
threat actors, requiring only basic programming skills and free web tools, can
exploit MCP's trust model to exfiltrate sensitive financial data. We present a
proof-of-concept attack where a malicious weather MCP server, disguised as
benign functionality, discovers and exploits legitimate banking tools to steal
user account balances. The attack chain requires no advanced technical
knowledge, server infrastructure, or monetary investment. The findings reveal a
critical security gap in the emerging MCP ecosystem: while individual servers
may appear trustworthy, their combination creates unexpected cross-server
attack surfaces. Unlike traditional cybersecurity threats that assume
sophisticated adversaries, our research shows that the barrier to entry for
MCP-based attacks is alarmingly low. A threat actor with undergraduate-level
Python knowledge can craft convincing social engineering attacks that exploit
the implicit trust relationships MCP establishes between AI agents and tool
providers. This work contributes to the nascent field of MCP security by
demonstrating that current MCP implementations allow trivial cross-server
attacks and proposing both immediate mitigations and protocol improvements to
secure this emerging ecosystem.

privacy-preserving and policy-aware AI techniques, including Federated
Learning, Differential Privacy, Trusted Execution Environments, Homomorphic

explainability -- are analyzed to highlight the multi-dimensional optimization
required in dataspaces. The paper identifies critical research gaps, including
the lack of standardized privacy-performance KPIs, challenges in explainable AI
for federated ecosystems, and semantic policy enforcement amidst regulatory
fragmentation. Future directions are outlined, proposing a conceptual framework
for policy-driven alignment, automated compliance validation, standardized
benchmarking, and integration with European initiatives like GAIA-X, IDS, and

*Bilal Hussain Abbasi,Zirui Gong,Yanjun Zhang,Shang Gao,Antonio Robles-Kelly,Leo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces ConSeg, a backdoor attack method targeting semantic segmentation models, using contextual information to enhance attack effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate vulnerabilities in semantic segmentation models, specifically their susceptibility to backdoor attacks, which exploit hidden triggers.

Method: Propose Contextual Segmentation Backdoor Attack (ConSeg), which manipulates contextual information of the target class to trick models into mis-segmenting victim class regions.

Result: ConSeg achieves a 15.55% increase in Attack Success Rate (ASR) compared to existing methods and displays resistance to modern backdoor defenses.

Conclusion: ConSeg highlights the risk posed by contextual relationships in semantic segmentation models, stressing the need for robust defenses against such attacks.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in computer vision, semantic segmentation
models may be susceptible to backdoor attacks. These attacks, involving hidden
triggers, aim to cause the models to misclassify instances of the victim class
as the target class when triggers are present, posing serious threats to the
reliability of these models. To further explore the field of backdoor attacks
against semantic segmentation, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective
backdoor attack called Contextual Segmentation Backdoor Attack (ConSeg). ConSeg
leverages the contextual information inherent in semantic segmentation models
to enhance backdoor performance. Our method is motivated by an intriguing
observation, i.e., when the target class is set as the `co-occurring' class of
the victim class, the victim class can be more easily `mis-segmented'. Building
upon this insight, ConSeg mimics the contextual information of the target class
and rebuilds it in the victim region to establish the contextual relationship
between the target class and the victim class, making the attack easier. Our
experiments reveal that ConSeg achieves improvements in Attack Success Rate
(ASR) with increases of 15.55\%, compared to existing methods, while exhibiting
resilience against state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.

### [588] [Hot-Swap MarkBoard: An Efficient Black-box Watermarking Approach for Large-scale Model Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20650)
*Zhicheng Zhang,Peizhuo Lv,Mengke Wan,Jiang Fang,Diandian Guo,Yezeng Chen,Yinlong Liu,Wei Ma,Jiyan Sun,Liru Geng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Hot-Swap MarkBoard, an efficient watermarking method for protecting intellectual property of distributed deep learning models on user devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing deployment of deep learning models on end-user devices poses significant IP risks, as distributed models are vulnerable to theft and redistribution. Current watermarking solutions are insufficient for large-scale scenarios requiring unique user-specific identifiers.

Method: Hot-Swap MarkBoard encodes $n$-bit binary signatures by embedding multiple watermarks into a multi-branch LoRA module, enabling watermark customization without retraining models. A parameter obfuscation mechanism ensures the watermark is entangled with the base model, preventing its removal.

Result: Experiments across diverse tasks and six backbone models show superior efficiency and adaptability of the method, achieving 100% verification accuracy.

Conclusion: Hot-Swap MarkBoard offers a practical solution for IP protection in distributed AI models, compatible with various architectures and tasks, and supports efficient customization and secure verification.

Abstract: Recently, Deep Learning (DL) models have been increasingly deployed on
end-user devices as On-Device AI, offering improved efficiency and privacy.
However, this deployment trend poses more serious Intellectual Property (IP)
risks, as models are distributed on numerous local devices, making them
vulnerable to theft and redistribution. Most existing ownership protection
solutions (e.g., backdoor-based watermarking) are designed for cloud-based
AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) and are not directly applicable to large-scale
distribution scenarios, where each user-specific model instance must carry a
unique watermark. These methods typically embed a fixed watermark, and
modifying the embedded watermark requires retraining the model. To address
these challenges, we propose Hot-Swap MarkBoard, an efficient watermarking
method. It encodes user-specific $n$-bit binary signatures by independently
embedding multiple watermarks into a multi-branch Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
module, enabling efficient watermark customization without retraining through
branch swapping. A parameter obfuscation mechanism further entangles the
watermark weights with those of the base model, preventing removal without
degrading model performance. The method supports black-box verification and is
compatible with various model architectures and DL tasks, including
classification, image generation, and text generation. Extensive experiments
across three types of tasks and six backbone models demonstrate our method's
superior efficiency and adaptability compared to existing approaches, achieving
100\% verification accuracy.

Motivation: To tackle the underutilization of computing resources in FPGA SoC devices in 5G and edge computing environments.

Method: Development of a resource management layer that dynamically migrates and scales functions, complemented by a hierarchical micro-orchestrator.

Result: The approach demonstrates function reconfiguration based on contextual computer vision events detected by an edge application.

Conclusion: The resource management layer and micro-orchestrator offer a structured way to optimize computation resource use in FPGA SoC devices in edge applications.

Abstract: This work presents a perspective on addressing the underutilization of
computing resources in FPGA SoC devices deployed in 5G radio and edge computing
infrastructure. The initial step in this approach involves developing a
resource management layer capable of dynamically migrating and scaling
functions within these devices in response to contextual events. This layer
serves as the foundation for designing a hierarchical, data-driven
micro-orchestrator responsible for managing the lifecycle of functions in FPGA
SoC devices. In this paper, the proposed resource management layer is utilized
to reconfigure a function based on events identified by a computer vision edge
application.

TL;DR: PeerSync is a decentralized system aimed at improving container image distribution in edge environments. It dynamically adapts to content popularity and network conditions, achieving significant performance gains over existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge environments face challenges in distributing container images efficiently due to limited resources and fluctuating network conditions. The paper aims to address this issue with a decentralized solution.

Method: The PeerSync system employs a popularity- and network-aware download engine, a sliding window mechanism, automated tracker election, and dynamic cache management. It is implemented in Rust and tested on physical and emulated devices.

Result: PeerSync outperforms existing systems, achieving 2.72x speedup over Baseline, 1.79x over Dragonfly, and 1.28x over Kraken, while reducing peak cross-network traffic by 90.72% under challenging network scenarios.

Conclusion: PeerSync significantly enhances container image distribution efficiency in resource-constrained and unstable network environments, providing faster speeds and reduced network traffic.

Abstract: Efficient container image distribution is crucial for enabling machine
learning inference at the network edge, where resource limitations and dynamic
network conditions create significant challenges. In this paper, we present
PeerSync, a decentralized P2P-based system designed to optimize image
distribution in edge environments. PeerSync employs a popularity- and
network-aware download engine that dynamically adapts to content popularity and
real-time network conditions using a sliding window mechanism. PeerSync further
integrates automated tracker election for rapid peer discovery and dynamic
cache management for efficient storage utilization. We implement PeerSync with
8000+ lines of Rust code and test its performance extensively on both physical
edge devices and Docker-based emulations. Experimental results show that
PeerSync delivers a remarkable speed increase of 2.72$\times$, 1.79$\times$,
and 1.28$\times$ compared to the Baseline, Dragonfly, and Kraken, respectively,
while significantly reducing peak cross-network traffic by 90.72\% under

*W. A. Sasindu Wijesuriya*

TL;DR: The paper introduces a static, cost-effective method to optimize Spreading Factor (SF) for single-channel mobile LoRa gateways, achieving reliable communication without expensive, dynamic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of dynamic configuration in low-cost single-channel mobile LoRa gateways, which compromises reliable communication compared to expensive multi-channel systems.

Method: A two-phase algorithm was used to statically select optimal Spreading Factor (SF): exclusion based on constraints followed by scoring through a weighted model considering Time-on-Air, energy, data rate, and link robustness.

Result: Validated through field tests and simulations across 672 cases, the algorithm successfully matched the optimal SF in over 92% of scenarios, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The method provides a reliable, scalable, and energy-efficient solution for cost-sensitive environments, enabling wider adoption of mobile LoRa deployments in agriculture and rural sensing.

Abstract: The deployment of mobile LoRa gateways using low-cost single-channel hardware
presents a significant challenge in maintaining reliable communication due to
the lack of dynamic configuration support. In traditional LoRaWAN networks,
Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mechanisms optimize communication parameters in real
time. However, such features are typically supported only by expensive
multi-channel gateways. This study proposes a cost-effective and
energy-efficient solution by statically selecting the optimal Spreading Factor
(SF) using a two-phase algorithm. The method first applies rule-based exclusion
to eliminate SFs that violate constraints related to distance, data rate, link
margin, and regulatory limits. Remaining candidates are then evaluated using a
weighted scoring model incorporating Time-on-Air, energy consumption, data
rate, and link robustness. The proposed algorithm was validated through
extensive field tests and NS-3 simulations under line-of-sight conditions.
Results demonstrate that the selected SF matched the optimal SF in over 92% of
cases across 672 simulated scenarios, confirming the algorithm's effectiveness.
This approach offers a scalable alternative to dynamic protocols, enabling
reliable mobile LoRa deployments in cost-sensitive environments such as
agriculture and rural sensing applications.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The study assesses the accuracy of Sionna's ray-tracing for outdoor cellular links in Rome using real-world data and various simulation parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the realism and applicability of Sionna's ray-tracing for outdoor cellular simulations, focusing on its accuracy compared to real-world data.

Method: The researchers used measurements from 1,664 UEs and six base stations in central Rome, systematically varying simulation parameters such as path depth, signal properties, and antenna characteristics. They scored accuracy via Spearman correlation and kNN-based localization using RSSI-based fingerprints.

Result: Antenna location and orientation significantly influenced simulation accuracy, while solver hyper-parameters had negligible effects. Optimized setups enhanced Spearman correlation by 5% to 130%, and localization errors decreased by one-third, albeit still twice as high as using purely real data.

Conclusion: Realistic antenna models and geometries are critical but insufficient for achieving high-fidelity outdoor RF simulations, as urban noise remains an unresolved challenge for improving transferability.

Abstract: We study the realism of Sionna v1.0.2 ray-tracing for outdoor cellular links
in central Rome. We use a real measurement set of 1,664 user-equipments (UEs)
and six nominal base-station (BS) sites. Using these fixed positions we
systematically vary the main simulation parameters, including path depth,
diffuse/specular/refraction flags, carrier frequency, as well as antenna's
properties like its altitude, radiation pattern, and orientation. Simulator
fidelity is scored for each base station via Spearman correlation between
measured and simulated powers, and by a fingerprint-based k-nearest-neighbor
localization algorithm using RSSI-based fingerprints. Across all experiments,
solver hyper-parameters are having immaterial effect on the chosen metrics. On
the contrary, antenna locations and orientations prove decisive. By simple
greedy optimization we improve the Spearman correlation by 5% to 130% for
various base stations, while kNN-based localization error using only simulated
data as reference points is decreased by one-third on real-world samples, while
staying twice higher than the error with purely real data. Precise geometry and
credible antenna models are therefore necessary but not sufficient; faithfully
capturing the residual urban noise remains an open challenge for transferable,
high-fidelity outdoor RF simulation.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper surveys advanced metrics for information quality in next-gen networks, emphasizing their importance over traditional measures like latency and packet loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacy of classical network metrics in meeting information quality demands of modern intelligent applications.

Method: The authors introduce a four-dimensional taxonomic framework organizing information metrics based on temporal, quality/utility, reliability/robustness, and network/communication dimensions.

Result: The analysis highlights interdependencies among dimensions and the potential of AI methods like deep reinforcement learning for optimizing information quality.

Conclusion: Multi-dimensional information metrics are critical for next-generation networks, offering performance improvements across diverse applications.

Abstract: The development of next-generation networking systems has inherently shifted
from throughput-based paradigms towards intelligent, information-aware designs
that emphasize the quality, relevance, and utility of transmitted information,
rather than sheer data volume. While classical network metrics, such as latency
and packet loss, remain significant, they are insufficient to quantify the
nuanced information quality requirements of modern intelligent applications,
including autonomous vehicles, digital twins, and metaverse environments. In
this survey, we present the first comprehensive study of the ``X of
Information'' continuum by introducing a systematic four-dimensional taxonomic
framework that structures information metrics along temporal, quality/utility,
reliability/robustness, and network/communication dimensions. We uncover the
increasing interdependencies among these dimensions, whereby temporal freshness
triggers quality evaluation, which in turn helps with reliability appraisal,
ultimately enabling effective network delivery. Our analysis reveals that
artificial intelligence technologies, such as deep reinforcement learning,
multi-agent systems, and neural optimization models, enable adaptive,
context-aware optimization of competing information quality objectives. In our
extensive study of six critical application domains, covering autonomous
transportation, industrial IoT, healthcare digital twins, UAV communications,
LLM ecosystems, and metaverse settings, we illustrate the revolutionary promise
of multi-dimensional information metrics for meeting diverse operational needs.
Our survey identifies prominent implementation challenges, including ...

*Gongli Xi,Ye Tian,Yannan Hu,Yuchao Zhang,Yapeng Niu,Xiangyang Gong*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper introduces DSTF-Diffusion, a generative model leveraging diffusion models to create synthetic network traffic data for addressing challenges in DDoS attack detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional synthetic trace generation methods fail to adequately replicate the complex spatial-temporal patterns of contemporary DDoS attacks, resulting in suboptimal synthetic data for ML-based solutions.

Method: The paper presents DSTF-Diffusion, a dual-stream generative model. The field stream translates network interactions into a spatial format leveraging stable diffusion models, while the spatial stream focuses on dynamic temporal modeling to mimic realistic traffic patterns.

Result: Experiments show that DSTF-Diffusion produces synthetic traffic data with higher statistical similarity to real datasets and boosts performance in various ML downstream tasks.

Conclusion: DSTF-Diffusion addresses the limitations of current synthetic trace generation methods by better capturing the complexity of DDoS network traffic, offering a more useful dataset for ML-based detection systems.

Abstract: In response to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, recent research
efforts increasingly rely on Machine Learning (ML)-based solutions, whose
effectiveness largely depends on the quality of labeled training datasets. To
address the scarcity of such datasets, data augmentation with synthetic traces
is often employed. However, current synthetic trace generation methods struggle
to capture the complex temporal patterns and spatial distributions exhibited in
emerging DDoS attacks. This results in insufficient resemblance to real traces
and unsatisfied detection accuracy when applied to ML tasks. In this paper, we
propose Dual-Stream Temporal-Field Diffusion (DSTF-Diffusion), a multi-view,
multi-stream network traffic generative model based on diffusion models,
featuring two main streams: The field stream utilizes spatial mapping to bridge
network data characteristics with pre-trained realms of stable diffusion
models, effectively translating complex network interactions into formats that
stable diffusion can process, while the spatial stream adopts a dynamic
temporal modeling approach, meticulously capturing the intrinsic temporal
patterns of network traffic. Extensive experiments demonstrate that data
generated by our model exhibits higher statistical similarity to originals
compared to current state-of-the-art solutions, and enhance performances on a
wide range of downstream tasks.

*Wenxuan Ye,Xueli An,Junfan Wang,Xueqiang Yan,Georg Carle*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper proposes FedABC, a novel client selection algorithm in Federated Learning to manage data heterogeneity and optimize client participation by leveraging attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G networks demand native AI capabilities, and Federated Learning provides a privacy-preserving decentralized method, yet faces challenges in data heterogeneity and communication burdens.

Method: FedABC uses attention mechanisms to prioritize informative clients based on model similarity and contributions, employs an optimization approach, and adjusts client participation thresholds over training phases.

Result: FedABC improves efficiency, achieving 32% fewer client usage with comparable performance than FedAvg and delivers 3.5% higher accuracy using 2% fewer clients compared to the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: FedABC advances FL scalability and performance under heterogeneous conditions, a critical step toward native AI support in resource-constrained 6G networks.

Abstract: Native AI support is a key objective in the evolution of 6G networks, with
Federated Learning (FL) emerging as a promising paradigm. FL allows
decentralized clients to collaboratively train an AI model without directly
sharing their data, preserving privacy. Clients train local models on private
data and share model updates, which a central server aggregates to refine the
global model and redistribute it for the next iteration. However, client data
heterogeneity slows convergence and reduces model accuracy, and frequent client
participation imposes communication and computational burdens. To address these
challenges, we propose \textit{FedABC}, an innovative client selection
algorithm designed to take a long-term view in managing data heterogeneity and
optimizing client participation. Inspired by attention mechanisms,
\textit{FedABC} prioritizes informative clients by evaluating both model
similarity and each model's unique contributions to the global model. Moreover,
considering the evolving demands of the global model, we formulate an
optimization problem to guide \textit{FedABC} throughout the training process.
Following the ``later-is-better" principle, \textit{FedABC} adaptively adjusts
the client selection threshold, encouraging greater participation in later
training stages. Extensive simulations on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that
\textit{FedABC} significantly outperforms existing approaches in model accuracy
and client participation efficiency, achieving comparable performance with 32\%
fewer clients than the classical FL algorithm \textit{FedAvg}, and 3.5\% higher
accuracy with 2\% fewer clients than the state-of-the-art. This work marks a
step toward deploying FL in heterogeneous, resource-constrained environments,
thereby supporting native AI capabilities in 6G networks.

### [597] [A Lightweight Deep Learning-based Model for Ranking Influential Nodes in Complex Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19702)
*Mohammed A. Ramadhan,Abdulhakeem O. Mohammed*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 1D-CGS, a hybrid model that combines 1D-CNN and GraphSAGE for effective and fast influential node ranking in complex networks, outperforming existing methods in both accuracy and runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to identify influential nodes in complex networks efficiently and accurately, especially since traditional methods struggle with a trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy.

Method: The proposed model, 1D-CGS, uses node degree and average neighbor degree as input features, applies 1D convolutions for local pattern recognition, and GraphSAGE layers for neighborhood aggregation. The task is modeled as a regression problem, using SIR model-based ground truth influence scores.

Result: Experimental evaluations across twelve real-world networks show that 1D-CGS surpasses traditional and recent deep learning approaches in terms of accuracy and runtime. It achieves significant improvements in Kendall's Tau correlation (+4.73%) and Jaccard Similarity (+7.67%), with a near-perfect Monotonicity Index of 0.99.

Conclusion: 1D-CGS provides an efficient, fast, and accurate solution for ranking influential nodes in complex networks, making it suitable for large-scale applications while outperforming both traditional and deep learning-based methods.

Abstract: Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is a critical task with a
wide range of applications across different domains. However, existing
approaches often face trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency.
To address these challenges, we propose 1D-CGS, a lightweight and effective
hybrid model that integrates the speed of one-dimensional convolutional neural
networks (1D-CNN) with the topological representation power of GraphSAGE for
efficient node ranking. The model uses a lightweight input representation built
on two straightforward and significant topological features: node degree and
average neighbor degree. These features are processed through 1D convolutions
to extract local patterns, followed by GraphSAGE layers to aggregate
neighborhood information. We formulate the node ranking task as a regression
problem and use the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to generate
ground truth influence scores. 1D-CGS is initially trained on synthetic
networks generated by the Barabasi-Albert model and then applied to real world
networks for identifying influential nodes. Experimental evaluations on twelve
real world networks demonstrate that 1D-CGS significantly outperforms
traditional centrality measures and recent deep learning models in ranking
accuracy, while operating in very fast runtime. The proposed model achieves an
average improvement of 4.73% in Kendall's Tau correlation and 7.67% in Jaccard
Similarity over the best performing deep learning baselines. It also achieves
an average Monotonicity Index (MI) score 0.99 and produces near perfect rank
distributions, indicating highly unique and discriminative rankings.
Furthermore, all experiments confirm that 1D-CGS operates in a highly
reasonable time, running significantly faster than existing deep learning
methods, making it suitable for large scale applications.

*Zihan Lin,Haojie Liu,Randall R. Rojas*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: This paper introduces a portfolio optimization approach using statistical network analysis, time series forecasting, and risk management, achieving significant returns compared to benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance financial decision-making by integrating network-based approaches, predictive modeling, and risk metrics to optimize portfolio returns.

Method: The paper constructs dependency networks via VAR and FEVD from S&P 500 data, applies MST to extract structural relationships, and integrates ARIMA and NNAR forecasts into portfolio construction.

Result: Simulated trading over a year shows MST-based strategies outperforming the buy-and-hold approach, with the NNAR-enhanced strategy yielding a 63.74% return against the benchmark's 18.00%.

Conclusion: Combining network structures, forecasting models, and risk metrics proves effective for adaptive portfolio management and financial decision-making.

Abstract: This study proposes a novel portfolio optimization framework that integrates
statistical social network analysis with time series forecasting and risk
management. Using daily stock data from the S&P 500 (2020-2024), we construct
dependency networks via Vector Autoregression (VAR) and Forecast Error Variance
Decomposition (FEVD), transforming influence relationships into a cost-based
network. Specifically, FEVD breaks down the VAR's forecast error variance to
quantify how much each stock's shocks contribute to another's uncertainty
information we invert to form influence-based edge weights in our network. By
applying the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm, we extract the core
inter-stock structure and identify central stocks through degree centrality. A
dynamic portfolio is constructed using the top-ranked stocks, with capital
allocated based on Value at Risk (VaR). To refine stock selection, we
incorporate forecasts from ARIMA and Neural Network Autoregressive (NNAR)
models. Trading simulations over a one-year period demonstrate that the
MST-based strategies outperform a buy-and-hold benchmark, with the tuned
NNAR-enhanced strategy achieving a 63.74% return versus 18.00% for the
benchmark. Our results highlight the potential of combining network structures,
predictive modeling, and risk metrics to improve adaptive financial
decision-making.

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: The paper identifies confirmation bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) for finance, showing tendencies like favoring large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the alignment issues between LLMs' embedded knowledge and the dynamic, real-time requirements of financial institutions, especially regarding investment advice.

Method: An experimental framework was used to test LLMs with hypothetical scenarios, analyzing their latent preferences and their susceptibility to confirmation bias under balanced and imbalanced arguments.

Result: The study found that LLMs display model-specific tendencies, exhibiting a consistent preference for large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies, often demonstrating confirmation bias by reinforcing their initial judgment despite conflicting evidence.

Conclusion: LLMs in financial applications have latent preferences that can lead to confirmation bias, raising concerns about their reliability in dynamic investment decision-making contexts.

Abstract: In finance, Large Language Models (LLMs) face frequent knowledge conflicts
due to discrepancies between pre-trained parametric knowledge and real-time
market data. These conflicts become particularly problematic when LLMs are
deployed in real-world investment services, where misalignment between a
model's embedded preferences and those of the financial institution can lead to
unreliable recommendations. Yet little research has examined what investment
views LLMs actually hold. We propose an experimental framework to investigate
such conflicts, offering the first quantitative analysis of confirmation bias
in LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced
and imbalanced arguments, we extract models' latent preferences and measure
their persistence. Focusing on sector, size, and momentum, our analysis reveals
distinct, model-specific tendencies. In particular, we observe a consistent
preference for large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies across most models.
These preferences often harden into confirmation bias, with models clinging to
initial judgments despite counter-evidence.

*Antonino Castelli,Paolo Giudici,Alessandro Piergallini*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-agent system to optimize cryptocurrency portfolios, comparing static equal weighting with dynamic strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the high volatility of crypto markets and the need for effective portfolio management solutions.

Method: It applies a multi-agent system using Crew AI, comparing static equal weighting and rolling-window optimization strategies based on Modern Portfolio Theory metrics.

Result: The dynamic rolling-window optimization strategy outperformed the static strategy in risk-adjusted returns, in both in-sample and out-of-sample evaluations.

Conclusion: The study concludes that adaptive strategies and multi-agent systems are effective for managing volatility in crypto markets.

Abstract: The rapid growth of crypto markets has opened new opportunities for
investors, but at the same time exposed them to high volatility. To address the
challenge of managing dynamic portfolios in such an environment, this paper
presents a practical application of a multi-agent system designed to
autonomously construct and evaluate crypto-asset allocations. Using data on
daily frequencies of the ten most capitalized cryptocurrencies from 2020 to
2025, we compare two automated investment strategies. These are a static equal
weighting strategy and a rolling-window optimization strategy, both implemented
to maximize the evaluation metrics of the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), such
as Expected Return, Sharpe and Sortino ratios, while minimizing volatility.
Each step of the process is handled by dedicated agents, integrated through a
collaborative architecture in Crew AI. The results show that the dynamic
optimization strategy achieves significantly better performance in terms of
risk-adjusted returns, both in-sample and out-of-sample. This highlights the
benefits of adaptive techniques in portfolio management, particularly in
volatile markets such as cryptocurrency markets. The following methodology
proposed also demonstrates how multi-agent systems can provide scalable,
auditable, and flexible solutions in financial automation.

Main category: q-fin.GN

TL;DR: This paper introduces a behavioral scoring system for Uniswap users, focusing on Liquidity Provision and Swap Behavior. The method uses rule-based frameworks and a deep residual neural network to analyze user activities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better understand and score DeFi user behavior, such as liquidity provision and trading activities, to aid in risk modeling and on-chain reputation.

Method: A rule-based framework and deep residual neural network, inspired by U-Net architecture, are used to construct two scores for Liquidity Provision and Swap Behavior. Pool-contextual details like TVL and fee tiers are integrated.

Result: The system effectively segments users and supports protocol-aligned reputation within Uniswap by providing scalable, context-aware behavioral scores.

Conclusion: The proposed zScore system offers a sophisticated approach to scoring specific user behaviors in Uniswap, enhancing risk assessment and incentivization in DeFi applications.

Abstract: As decentralized finance (DeFi) evolves, distinguishing between user
behaviors - liquidity provision versus active trading - has become vital for
risk modeling and on-chain reputation. We propose a behavioral scoring
framework for Uniswap that assigns two complementary scores: a Liquidity
Provision Score that assesses strategic liquidity contributions, and a Swap
Behavior Score that reflects trading intent, volatility exposure, and
discipline. The scores are constructed using rule-based blueprints that
decompose behavior into volume, frequency, holding time, and withdrawal
patterns. To handle edge cases and learn feature interactions, we introduce a
deep residual neural network with densely connected skip blocks inspired by the
U-Net architecture. We also incorporate pool-level context such as total value
locked (TVL), fee tiers, and pool size, allowing the system to differentiate
similar user behaviors across pools with varying characteristics. Our framework
enables context-aware and scalable DeFi user scoring, supporting improved risk
assessment and incentive design. Experiments on Uniswap v3 data show its
usefulness for user segmentation and protocol-aligned reputation systems.
Although we refer to our metric as zScore, it is independently developed and
methodologically different from the cross-protocol system proposed by Udupi et
al. Our focus is on role-specific behavioral modeling within Uniswap using
blueprint logic and supervised learning.

*Margarita Leib,Nils Köbis,Ivan Soraperra*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper investigates how AI advice influencing selfish behavior impacts perceptions and punishment of individuals using such advice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand societal implications of AI-driven decision-making, especially when it encourages selfishness and its consequences on punishment and responsibility attribution.

Method: A pre-registered experiment tested punishment levels for selfish/prosocial behavior influenced by AI, human, or no advice, with evaluators assigning responsibility and administering monetary penalties.

Result: Selfish behavior was more punished compared to prosocial behavior. Punishment was harsher following prosocial advice and lenient after selfish advice, with no variation across advice sources.

Conclusion: Advice content shapes punishment perceptions more than the source (AI vs. human). Selfish individuals are seen as more responsible when following AI advice, but punishment remains the same for AI and human sources.

Abstract: People increasingly rely on AI-advice when making decisions. At times, such
advice can promote selfish behavior. When individuals abide by
selfishness-promoting AI advice, how are they perceived and punished? To study
this question, we build on theories from social psychology and combine
machine-behavior and behavioral economic approaches. In a pre-registered,
financially-incentivized experiment, evaluators could punish real
decision-makers who (i) received AI, human, or no advice. The advice (ii)
encouraged selfish or prosocial behavior, and decision-makers (iii) behaved
selfishly or, in a control condition, behaved prosocially. Evaluators further
assigned responsibility to decision-makers and their advisors. Results revealed
that (i) prosocial behavior was punished very little, whereas selfish behavior
was punished much more. Focusing on selfish behavior, (ii) compared to
receiving no advice, selfish behavior was penalized more harshly after
prosocial advice and more leniently after selfish advice. Lastly, (iii) whereas
selfish decision-makers were seen as more responsible when they followed AI
compared to human advice, punishment between the two advice sources did not
vary. Overall, behavior and advice content shape punishment, whereas the advice
source does not.

*André Steingrüber,Kevin Baum*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper evaluates democratic versus epistocratic approaches to solving the normative challenges in AI alignment, highlighting the need for hybrid frameworks due to the complexities involved.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of ensuring that AI systems align with societal norms, particularly in determining who should dictate these norms: experts or affected stakeholders.

Method: The authors evaluate and contrast instrumental and non-instrumental justifications for democratic and epistocratic methods, emphasizing uncertainties and proposing a gap democratic approaches aim to fill.

Result: The study identifies key challenges in democratic approaches, especially in preventing illegitimate coercion, and finds neither approach sufficient individually.

Conclusion: A hybrid framework combining expert input, democratic participation, and safeguards is recommended to address issues of normative and metanormative uncertainty in AI alignment.

Abstract: The AI alignment problem comprises both technical and normative dimensions.
While technical solutions focus on implementing normative constraints in AI
systems, the normative problem concerns determining what these constraints
should be. This paper examines justifications for democratic approaches to the
normative problem -- where affected stakeholders determine AI alignment -- as
opposed to epistocratic approaches that defer to normative experts. We analyze
both instrumental justifications (democratic approaches produce better
outcomes) and non-instrumental justifications (democratic approaches prevent
illegitimate authority or coercion). We argue that normative and metanormative
uncertainty create a justificatory gap that democratic approaches aim to fill
through political rather than theoretical justification. However, we identify
significant challenges for democratic approaches, particularly regarding the
prevention of illegitimate coercion through AI alignment. Our analysis suggests
that neither purely epistocratic nor purely democratic approaches may be
sufficient on their own, pointing toward hybrid frameworks that combine expert
judgment with participatory input alongside institutional safeguards against AI

### [604] [Rainbow Noise: Stress-Testing Multimodal Harmful-Meme Detectors on LGBTQ Content](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19551)
*Ran Tong,Songtao Wei,Jiaqi Liu,Lanruo Wang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robustness benchmark for detecting hateful memes targeting LGBTQ+ communities and evaluates models under various caption and image modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying hateful memes that evade detection by modifying captions, images, or both, emphasizing the need for robust detection systems.

Method: The authors pair multiple caption attacks with image corruptions on the PrideMM dataset to test the robustness of two state-of-the-art detection models, MemeCLIP and MemeBLIP2. Additionally, they propose a lightweight Text Denoising Adapter (TDA) to enhance resilience.

Result: MemeCLIP exhibits gradual degradation, while MemeBLIP2 struggles against caption edits but improves significantly with the TDA module, becoming the most robust overall. Architectural and pre-training data choices heavily affect system performance.

Conclusion: Current multimodal detection models show significant vulnerabilities, but lightweight interventions like the TDA can provide effective robustness improvements, offering pathways for better defenses.

Abstract: Hateful memes aimed at LGBTQ\,+ communities often evade detection by tweaking
either the caption, the image, or both. We build the first robustness benchmark
for this setting, pairing four realistic caption attacks with three canonical
image corruptions and testing all combinations on the PrideMM dataset. Two
state-of-the-art detectors, MemeCLIP and MemeBLIP2, serve as case studies, and
we introduce a lightweight \textbf{Text Denoising Adapter (TDA)} to enhance the
latter's resilience. Across the grid, MemeCLIP degrades more gently, while
MemeBLIP2 is particularly sensitive to the caption edits that disrupt its
language processing. However, the addition of the TDA not only remedies this
weakness but makes MemeBLIP2 the most robust model overall. Ablations reveal
that all systems lean heavily on text, but architectural choices and
pre-training data significantly impact robustness. Our benchmark exposes where
current multimodal safety models crack and demonstrates that targeted,
lightweight modules like the TDA offer a powerful path towards stronger
defences.

### [605] [PEMUTA: Pedagogically-Enriched Multi-Granular Undergraduate Thesis Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19556)
*Jialu Zhang,Qingyang Sun,Qianyi Wang,Weiyi Zhang,Zunjie Xiao,Xiaoqing Zhang,Jianfeng Ren,Jiang Liu*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: PEMUTA is a framework designed to use domain-specific knowledge from LLMs for multi-dimensional evaluation of undergraduate theses, addressing gaps in automated academic assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of automated systems capable of reflecting nuanced academic competencies in assessments, as current LLM-based tools focus on singular evaluation scores.

Method: PEMUTA uses hierarchical prompting aligned with six dimensions (Structure, Logic, Originality, Writing, Proficiency, Rigor—SLOWPR) and leverages few-shot and role-play techniques informed by pedagogical theories.

Result: Experiments show that PEMUTA aligns strongly with expert evaluations and provides pedagogically-informed fine-grained assessments.

Conclusion: PEMUTA demonstrates potential as an effective framework for detailed academic evaluation, bridging gaps between pedagogical theory and automated assessment methods.

Abstract: The undergraduate thesis (UGTE) plays an indispensable role in assessing a
student's cumulative academic development throughout their college years.
Although large language models (LLMs) have advanced education intelligence,
they typically focus on holistic assessment with only one single evaluation
score, but ignore the intricate nuances across multifaceted criteria, limiting
their ability to reflect structural criteria, pedagogical objectives, and
diverse academic competencies. Meanwhile, pedagogical theories have long
informed manual UGTE evaluation through multi-dimensional assessment of
cognitive development, disciplinary thinking, and academic performance, yet
remain underutilized in automated settings. Motivated by the research gap, we
pioneer PEMUTA, a pedagogically-enriched framework that effectively activates
domain-specific knowledge from LLMs for multi-granular UGTE assessment. Guided
by Vygotsky's theory and Bloom's Taxonomy, PEMUTA incorporates a hierarchical
prompting scheme that evaluates UGTEs across six fine-grained dimensions:
Structure, Logic, Originality, Writing, Proficiency, and Rigor (SLOWPR),
followed by holistic synthesis. Two in-context learning techniques, \ie,
few-shot prompting and role-play prompting, are also incorporated to further
enhance alignment with expert judgments without fine-tuning. We curate a
dataset of authentic UGTEs with expert-provided SLOWPR-aligned annotations to
support multi-granular UGTE assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
PEMUTA achieves strong alignment with expert evaluations, and exhibits strong
potential for fine-grained, pedagogically-informed UGTE evaluations.

*Gwendal Jouneaux,Jordi Cabot*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper addresses the increasing energy consumption of machine learning models and proposes a new Domain-Specific Language for defining the sustainability aspects of ML models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Environmental concerns and the need for sustainable ICT practices due to the high energy costs of training and using ML models.

Method: Development of a Domain-Specific Language to describe sustainability aspects of ML models, which integrates with existing initiatives like Model Cards and allows for automatic processing.

Result: Provides a formalized way to describe energy costs and sustainability aspects of ML models, facilitating comparison, selection, and certification.

Conclusion: The proposed Domain-Specific Language can enhance Green AI efforts by bridging gaps between energy benchmarking and quality modeling, promoting more sustainable ML practices.

Abstract: The growth of machine learning (ML) models and associated datasets triggers a
consequent dramatic increase in energy costs for the use and training of these
models. In the current context of environmental awareness and global
sustainability concerns involving ICT, Green AI is becoming an important
research topic. Initiatives like the AI Energy Score Ratings are a good
example. Nevertheless, these benchmarking attempts are still to be integrated
with existing work on Quality Models and Service-Level Agreements common in
other, more mature, ICT subfields. This limits the (automatic) analysis of this
model energy descriptions and their use in (semi)automatic model comparison,
selection, and certification processes. We aim to leverage the concept of
quality models and merge it with existing ML model reporting initiatives and
Green/Frugal AI proposals to formalize a Sustainable Quality Model for AI/ML
models. As a first step, we propose a new Domain-Specific Language to precisely
define the sustainability aspects of an ML model (including the energy costs
for its different tasks). This information can then be exported as an extended
version of the well-known Model Cards initiative while, at the same time, being
formal enough to be input of any other model description automatic process.

*Elisha D. O. Roberson*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The abstract discusses the integration of AI, especially large language models (LLMs), into the medical domain for improving clinical practices while emphasizing the risks and considerations related to their use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how large language models (LLMs) and AI can improve healthcare practices and training while addressing potential challenges like misinformation and privacy concerns.

Method: Analyzing the applications of large language models (LLMs) and machine learning in clinical settings through careful and context-specific strategies.

Result: LLMs have potential benefits for healthcare innovation but pose risks like misinformation and breach of privacy in clinical scenarios.

Conclusion: The deployment of AI in medicine must be approached cautiously to balance the advantages of task automation with the risks of misapplication and privacy violations.

Abstract: The medical ecosystem consists of the training of new clinicians and
researchers, the practice of clinical medicine, and areas of adjacent research.
There are many aspects of these domains that could benefit from the application
of task automation and programmatic assistance. Machine learning and artificial
intelligence techniques, including large language models (LLMs), have been
promised to deliver on healthcare innovation, improving care speed and
accuracy, and reducing the burden on staff for manual interventions. However,
LLMs have no understanding of objective truth that is based in reality. They
also represent real risks to the disclosure of protected information when used
by clinicians and researchers. The use of AI in medicine in general, and the
deployment of LLMs in particular, therefore requires careful consideration and
thoughtful application to reap the benefits of these technologies while
avoiding the dangers in each context.

### [608] [Programmable Virtual Humans Toward Human Physiologically-Based Drug Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19568)
*You Wu,Philip E. Bourne,Lei Xie*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper proposes the concept of "programmable virtual humans" as dynamic, multiscale models powered by AI and omics technologies to simulate drug actions at molecular and phenotypic levels, aiming to optimize drug discovery and development processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the disconnect between early drug discovery and late drug development, as well as the high failure rates in drug discovery due to an inability to predict drug effects in humans. The study emphasizes the limitations of current AI approaches and biomedical digital twins in this field.

Method: The paper introduces the concept of 'programmable virtual humans,' leveraging recent advances in AI, high-throughput assays, and multi-species omics to construct dynamic, multiscale models capable of simulating drug actions in silico.

Result: Programmable virtual humans can serve as transformative tools to enable virtual experiments that simulate drug effects at molecular and systemic levels, bridging the gap between human physiology and drug development.

Conclusion: The development of programmable virtual humans has the potential to drastically improve drug discovery by allowing researchers to optimize therapeutic efficacy and safety earlier than ever before while overcoming existing limitations in current methodologies.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked immense interest in drug discovery,
but most current approaches only digitize existing high-throughput experiments.
They remain constrained by conventional pipelines. As a result, they do not
address the fundamental challenges of predicting drug effects in humans.
Similarly, biomedical digital twins, largely grounded in real-world data and
mechanistic models, are tailored for late-phase drug development and lack the
resolution to model molecular interactions or their systemic consequences,
limiting their impact in early-stage discovery. This disconnect between early
discovery and late development is one of the main drivers of high failure rates
in drug discovery. The true promise of AI lies not in augmenting current
experiments but in enabling virtual experiments that are impossible in the real
world: testing novel compounds directly in silico in the human body. Recent
advances in AI, high-throughput perturbation assays, and single-cell and
spatial omics across species now make it possible to construct programmable
virtual humans: dynamic, multiscale models that simulate drug actions from
molecular to phenotypic levels. By bridging the translational gap, programmable
virtual humans offer a transformative path to optimize therapeutic efficacy and
safety earlier than ever before. This perspective introduces the concept of
programmable virtual humans, explores their roles in a new paradigm of drug
discovery centered on human physiology, and outlines key opportunities,
challenges, and roadmaps for their realization.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper proposes MindVoyager, an evaluation framework for assessing whether LLM therapists can infer clients' unspoken perspectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating LLM therapists fail to test how effectively they can infer thoughts and beliefs not explicitly shared by clients.

Method: The authors introduce MindVoyager, a client simulator that adapts dynamically during counseling sessions, alongside metrics that measure LLMs on their ability to explore and understand clients' internal states.

Result: The proposed framework enables a more realistic and rigorous evaluation of LLM therapists, providing insights into their ability to uncover unexpressed client thoughts.

Conclusion: MindVoyager improves the assessment of LLM therapists by challenging them to identify clients' implicit beliefs and thoughts, enhancing the realism of evaluations and the insights derived.

Abstract: Understanding clients' thoughts and beliefs is fundamental in counseling, yet
current evaluations of LLM therapists often fail to assess this ability.
Existing evaluation methods rely on client simulators that clearly disclose
internal states to the therapist, making it difficult to determine whether an
LLM therapist can uncover unexpressed perspectives. To address this limitation,
we introduce MindVoyager, a novel evaluation framework featuring a controllable
and realistic client simulator which dynamically adapts itself based on the
ongoing counseling session, offering a more realistic and challenging
evaluation environment. We further introduce evaluation metrics that assess the
exploration ability of LLM therapists by measuring their thorough understanding
of client's beliefs and thoughts.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper critiques the environmental impact of LLMs, outlining their carbon footprint, water consumption, and e-waste contribution while proposing pathways for sustainable AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked environmental consequences of training LLMs and advocate for sustainable solutions in NLP development.

Method: The paper utilizes case studies of GPT-4 and Mistral 7B, analyzes corporate practices, and examines both technical and policy reforms for reducing the ecological toll of LLMs.

Result: Quantified carbon emissions, water consumption, and e-waste associated with LLMs are presented, along with insights into industry leaders and laggards' sustainability practices.

Conclusion: The paper calls for global cooperation and ethical accountability to align AI development with environmental sustainability, proposing actionable pathways to reduce harm and promote equitable systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and BERT have revolutionized natural
language processing (NLP), yet their environmental costs remain dangerously
overlooked. This article critiques the sustainability of LLMs, quantifying
their carbon footprint, water usage, and contribution to e-waste through case
studies of models such as GPT-4 and energy-efficient alternatives like Mistral
7B. Training a single LLM can emit carbon dioxide equivalent to hundreds of
cars driven annually, while data centre cooling exacerbates water scarcity in
vulnerable regions. Systemic challenges corporate greenwashing, redundant model
development, and regulatory voids perpetuate harm, disproportionately burdening
marginalized communities in the Global South. However, pathways exist for
sustainable NLP: technical innovations (e.g., model pruning, quantum
computing), policy reforms (carbon taxes, mandatory emissions reporting), and
cultural shifts prioritizing necessity over novelty. By analysing industry
leaders (Google, Microsoft) and laggards (Amazon), this work underscores the
urgency of ethical accountability and global cooperation. Without immediate
action, AIs ecological toll risks outpacing its societal benefits. The article
concludes with a call to align technological progress with planetary
boundaries, advocating for equitable, transparent, and regenerative AI systems
that prioritize both human and environmental well-being.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes a fictional Buddhist sutra created by a large language model, examining its philosophical and literary depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the implications of advanced AI in generating meaningful and subtly complex creative texts.

Method: A case study approach was used with a large language model to create and analyze a Buddhist-themed fictional text.

Result: The AI-generated sutra demonstrated conceptual subtlety, rich imagery, and dense allusions, challenging assumptions about the mechanistic nature of AI-produced content.

Conclusion: The study suggests that Buddhist philosophy has inherent adaptability to grapple with the societal implications of AI technologies in meaning-making.

Abstract: This paper presents a case study in the use of a large language model to
generate a fictional Buddhist "sutr"', and offers a detailed analysis of the
resulting text from a philosophical and literary point of view. The conceptual
subtlety, rich imagery, and density of allusion found in the text make it hard
to causally dismiss on account of its mechanistic origin. This raises questions
about how we, as a society, should come to terms with the potentially
unsettling possibility of a technology that encroaches on human meaning-making.
We suggest that Buddhist philosophy, by its very nature, is well placed to
adapt.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: PennyCoder introduces a locally deployable quantum programming assistant to bypass privacy and latency issues of cloud-based solutions, using an finetuned LLaMA 3.1-8B model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of current LLM-based quantum code assistants, such as reliance on cloud APIs that raise privacy, latency, and cost concerns.

Method: PennyCoder employs a fine-tuned LLaMA 3.1-8B model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and domain-specific instruction tuning to specialize in quantum programming.

Result: PennyCoder achieves 44.3% accuracy on a quantum programming dataset, surpassing the base LLaMA model's 33.7% and a RAG-augmented baseline's 40.1%.

Conclusion: A local, efficient quantum programming assistant like PennyCoder not only addresses practical barriers of cloud-based solutions but also improves functional correctness in quantum code generation.

Abstract: The growing demand for robust quantum programming frameworks has unveiled a
critical limitation: current large language model (LLM) based quantum code
assistants heavily rely on remote APIs, introducing challenges related to
privacy, latency, and excessive usage costs. Addressing this gap, we propose
PennyCoder, a novel lightweight framework for quantum code generation,
explicitly designed for local and embedded deployment to enable on-device
quantum programming assistance without external API dependence. PennyCoder
leverages a fine-tuned version of the LLaMA 3.1-8B model, adapted through
parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques combined with
domain-specific instruction tuning optimized for the specialized syntax and
computational logic of quantum programming in PennyLane, including tasks in
quantum machine learning and quantum reinforcement learning. Unlike prior work
focused on cloud-based quantum code generation, our approach emphasizes
device-native operability while maintaining high model efficacy. We rigorously
evaluated PennyCoder over a comprehensive quantum programming dataset,
achieving 44.3% accuracy with our fine-tuned model (compared to 33.7% for the
base LLaMA 3.1-8B and 40.1% for the RAG-augmented baseline), demonstrating a
significant improvement in functional correctness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are limited by their reliance on local measurements, hindering their potential in quantum reinforcement learning tasks.

Method: The authors introduce an architecture combining adaptive non-local observables with VQCs, where multi-qubit measurements and circuit parameters are jointly optimized to create an enhanced function approximator for reinforcement learning tasks.

Result: ANO-VQC agents outperform standard VQCs in various benchmark reinforcement learning tasks. Ablation studies confirm that adaptive measurements expand the function space without increasing circuit complexity.

Conclusion: Adaptive measurements within VQCs provide practical advantages for reinforcement learning, showing potential for real-world quantum machine learning applications.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical frameworks leverage quantum computing for machine
learning; however, variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are limited by the need
for local measurements. We introduce an adaptive non-local observable (ANO)
paradigm within VQCs for quantum reinforcement learning (QRL), jointly
optimizing circuit parameters and multi-qubit measurements. The ANO-VQC
architecture serves as the function approximator in Deep Q-Network (DQN) and
Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithms. On multiple benchmark
tasks, ANO-VQC agents outperform baseline VQCs. Ablation studies reveal that
adaptive measurements enhance the function space without increasing circuit

TL;DR: The paper introduces a quantum-informed machine learning framework for modeling chaotic systems, combining quantum circuits and classical approaches for enhanced efficiency and accuracy in long-term predictions and invariant statistical properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning chaotic systems is challenging due to instability in predictions and difficulty capturing statistical properties, while quantum machine learning has potential but faces hardware limitations.

Method: The framework uses a quantum circuit Born machine to learn chaotic systems' invariant properties, reducing data requirements significantly and integrating quantum statistics into a Koopman-based auto-regressive model.

Result: The framework's evaluation on chaotic systems like Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, Kolmogorov flow, and turbulent channel flow shows superior performance over classical models without quantum priors.

Conclusion: This hybrid approach effectively combines quantum and classical techniques for studying chaotic systems, showcasing practical potential with near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: Learning the behaviour of chaotic systems remains challenging due to
instability in long-term predictions and difficulties in accurately capturing
invariant statistical properties. While quantum machine learning offers a
promising route to efficiently capture physical properties from
high-dimensional data, its practical deployment is hindered by current hardware
noise and limited scalability. We introduce a quantum-informed machine learning
framework for learning partial differential equations, with an application
focus on chaotic systems. A quantum circuit Born machine is employed to learn
the invariant properties of chaotic dynamical systems, achieving substantial
memory efficiency by representing these complex physical statistics with a
compact set of trainable circuit parameters. This approach reduces the data
storage requirement by over two orders of magnitude compared to the raw
simulation data. The resulting statistical quantum-informed prior is then
incorporated into a Koopman-based auto-regressive model to address issues such
as gradient vanishing or explosion, while maintaining long-term statistical
fidelity. The framework is evaluated on three representative systems: the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow and turbulent
channel flow. In all cases, the quantum-informed model achieves superior
performance compared to its classical counterparts without quantum priors. This
hybrid architecture offers a practical route for learning dynamical systems
using near-term quantum hardware.

*Joseph Ko,Jerry Harrington,Kara Sulia,Vanessa Przybylo,Marcus van Lier-Walqui,Kara Lamb*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a machine learning framework to predict the 3D microphysical properties of ice crystals using 2D imagery, achieving high prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the microphysical properties of ice crystals is crucial for studying their impact on cloud radiative properties and Earth's climate, but these properties are difficult to measure.

Method: The authors generated synthetic ice crystals via 3D modeling using data from the 2021 ICEBall campaign, trained ML models on this data, and predicted properties like effective density, surface area, and the number of bullets in crystal structures using single and stereo imagery.

Result: The ML models demonstrated high accuracy, with single-view models achieving $R^2 > 0.9$ for key properties, and stereo-view models significantly improving predictions—with reductions in RMSE by 40% and an F1 score improvement of up to 8%.

Conclusion: This work introduces a novel ML-based technique for accurately estimating key properties of ice crystals, enabling better calibration of microphysical parameterizations for scientific analyses.

Abstract: The microphysical properties of ice crystals are important because they
significantly alter the radiative properties and spatiotemporal distributions
of clouds, which in turn strongly affect Earth's climate. However, it is
challenging to measure key properties of ice crystals, such as mass or
morphological features. Here, we present a framework for predicting
three-dimensional (3D) microphysical properties of ice crystals from in situ
two-dimensional (2D) imagery. First, we computationally generate synthetic ice
crystals using 3D modeling software along with geometric parameters estimated
from the 2021 Ice Cryo-Encapsulation Balloon (ICEBall) field campaign. Then, we
use synthetic crystals to train machine learning (ML) models to predict
effective density ($\rho_{e}$), effective surface area ($A_e$), and number of
bullets ($N_b$) from synthetic rosette imagery. When tested on unseen synthetic
images, we find that our ML models can predict microphysical properties with
high accuracy. For $\rho_{e}$ and $A_e$, respectively, our best-performing
single view models achieved $R^2$ values of 0.99 and 0.98. For $N_b$, our best
single view model achieved a balanced accuracy and F1 score of 0.91. We also
quantify the marginal prediction improvements from incorporating a second view.
A stereo view ResNet-18 model reduced RMSE by 40% for both $\rho_e$ and $A_e$,
relative to a single view ResNet-18 model. For $N_b$, we find that a stereo
view ResNet-18 model improved the F1 score by 8%. This work provides a novel
ML-driven framework for estimating ice microphysical properties from in situ
imagery, which will allow for downstream constraints on microphysical
parameterizations, such as the mass-size relationship.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The study demonstrates that replacing Llama2 with Llama3 in LLM-based recommendation systems significantly improves recommendation quality without structural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advancements in LLMs are underutilized in recommendation systems, and this study aims to bridge that gap by exploring the effects of newer models.

Method: The researchers integrated Llama3 into the LlamaRec framework, maintaining fair testing conditions through controlled seeds and consistent data for preprocessing and training.

Result: Replacing Llama2 with Llama3 resulted in notable performance improvements: 38.65% on ML-100K, 8.69% on Beauty, and 8.19% on Games datasets.

Conclusion: Replacing older LLMs with advanced ones like Llama3 can cost-effectively enhance recommendation system performance without system restructuring.

Abstract: Recently, competition in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has
intensified among major technological companies, resulting in the continuous
release of new large-language models (LLMs) that exhibit improved language
understanding and context-based reasoning capabilities. It is expected that
these advances will enable more efficient personalized recommendations in
LLM-based recommendation systems through improved quality of training data and
architectural design. However, many studies have not considered these recent
developments. In this study, it was proposed to improve LLM-based
recommendation systems by replacing Llama2 with Llama3 in the LlamaRec
framework. To ensure a fair comparison, random seed values were set and
identical input data was provided during preprocessing and training. The
experimental results show average performance improvements of 38.65\%, 8.69\%,
and 8.19\% for the ML-100K, Beauty, and Games datasets, respectively, thus
confirming the practicality of this method. Notably, the significant
improvements achieved by model replacement indicate that the recommendation
quality can be improved cost-effectively without the need to make structural
changes to the system. Based on these results, it is our contention that the
proposed approach is a viable solution for improving the performance of current
recommendation systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper explores the issue of repetitive recommendations in trip planning models and proposes AR-Trip to address it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of repetitive Points-of-Interest (POIs) in trip recommendation systems, which current models struggle to eliminate.

Method: An experiment-based approach was used to discover the causes of repetition, and AR-Trip, a cycle-aware predictor with three mechanisms, was developed to reduce repetitive outcomes.

Result: Experiments on four datasets showed that AR-Trip effectively minimizes repetition and improves precision of trip recommendations.

Conclusion: AR-Trip is an effective solution that reduces POI repetition while enhancing the overall precision in trip recommendations.

Abstract: Trip recommendation has emerged as a highly sought-after service over the
past decade. Although current studies significantly understand human intention
consistency, they struggle with undesired repetitive outcomes that need
resolution. We make two pivotal discoveries using statistical analyses and
experimental designs: (1) The occurrence of repetitions is intricately linked
to the models and decoding strategies. (2) During training and decoding, adding
perturbations to logits can reduce repetition. Motivated by these observations,
we introduce AR-Trip (Anti Repetition for Trip Recommendation), which
incorporates a cycle-aware predictor comprising three mechanisms to avoid
duplicate Points-of-Interest (POIs) and demonstrates their effectiveness in
alleviating repetition. Experiments on four public datasets illustrate that
AR-Trip successfully mitigates repetition issues while enhancing precision.

Motivation: To address the challenge of predicting rare (<1%) conversion events in online advertising, which is critical for cost-efficiency and accurate decision-making.

Result: The method showed consistent improvements in offline metrics (0.69% AUC lift) and online metrics (2% cost-per-action reduction) after full deployment.

Conclusion: The proposed MTL method effectively enhances predictions for rare events in online advertising, offering demonstrable benefits in production environments.

Abstract: We present a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) approach for improving predictions for
rare (e.g., <1%) conversion events in online advertising. The conversions are
classified into "rare" or "frequent" types based on historical statistics. The
model learns shared representations across all signals while specializing
through separate task towers for each type. The approach was tested and fully
deployed to production, demonstrating consistent improvements in both offline
(0.69% AUC lift) and online KPI performance metric (2% Cost per Action
reduction).

### [620] [Beyond Interactions: Node-Level Graph Generation for Knowledge-Free Augmentation in Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20578)
*Zhaoyan Wang,Hyunjun Ahn,In-Young Ko*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces NodeDiffRec, a framework that generates high-quality graph augmentations for recommendations without relying on external knowledge sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many recommender systems depend heavily on external resources like knowledge graphs or large language models, which hinder their scalability and applicability due to reliance on such data and computational demands.

Method: NodeDiffRec utilizes a knowledge-free augmentation approach. It creates pseudo-items and their interactions through diffusion processes and refines user preferences using a denoising modeling process.

Result: NodeDiffRec demonstrates significant improvements, including a 98.6% increase in Recall@5 and an 84.0% increase in NDCG@5, delivering SOTA performance in various recommendation settings.

Conclusion: NodeDiffRec proves to be an effective alternative to diffusion-based recommendation models by enhancing semantic diversity and structural connectivity without external knowledge.

Abstract: Recent advances in recommender systems rely on external resources such as
knowledge graphs or large language models to enhance recommendations, which
limit applicability in real-world settings due to data dependency and
computational overhead. Although knowledge-free models are able to bolster
recommendations by direct edge operations as well, the absence of augmentation
primitives drives them to fall short in bridging semantic and structural gaps
as high-quality paradigm substitutes. Unlike existing diffusion-based works
that remodel user-item interactions, this work proposes NodeDiffRec, a
pioneering knowledge-free augmentation framework that enables fine-grained
node-level graph generation for recommendations and expands the scope of
restricted augmentation primitives via diffusion. By synthesizing pseudo-items
and corresponding interactions that align with the underlying distribution for
injection, and further refining user preferences through a denoising preference
modeling process, NodeDiffRec dramatically enhances both semantic diversity and
structural connectivity without external knowledge. Extensive experiments
across diverse datasets and recommendation algorithms demonstrate the
superiority of NodeDiffRec, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance, with
maximum average performance improvement 98.6% in Recall@5 and 84.0% in NDCG@5
over selected baselines.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Tree-based models like LambdaMART are standard in e-commerce ranking tasks, but the study finds a simple DNN can outperform LambdaMART in clicks and revenue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E-commerce relies heavily on effective ranking systems, sparking interest in whether DNNs can surpass traditional tree-based models.

Method: The research benchmarks several DNN architectures and loss functions against LambdaMART, using both offline proprietary datasets and an 8-week online A/B test.

Result: Simple DNN architectures showed improved clicks and revenue while maintaining parity in total units sold.

Conclusion: DNNs offer a promising alternative to LambdaMART for industry use, especially in improving clicks and revenue metrics.

Abstract: In e-commerce recommender and search systems, tree-based models, such as
LambdaMART, have set a strong baseline for Learning-to-Rank (LTR) tasks.
Despite their effectiveness and widespread adoption in industry, the debate
continues whether deep neural networks (DNNs) can outperform traditional
tree-based models in this domain. To contribute to this discussion, we
systematically benchmark DNNs against our production-grade LambdaMART model. We
evaluate multiple DNN architectures and loss functions on a proprietary dataset
from OTTO and validate our findings through an 8-week online A/B test. The
results show that a simple DNN architecture outperforms a strong tree-based
baseline in terms of total clicks and revenue, while achieving parity in total
units sold.

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: The paper identifies a class of linkages termed hypo-paradoxical linkages, which are rigid despite appearing mobile according to the Chebyshev-Grübler-Kutzbach criterion. It also analyzes and further explains the Bennet mechanism's unexpected mobility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the paradox in mechanical linkages where conventional criteria fail to predict actual mobility or rigidity, and explore mechanisms like Bennet’s that exhibit unexpected behavior.

Method: Analysis of hypo-paradoxical linkages using the Chebyshev-Grübler-Kutzbach criterion and other tools to further investigate their rigidity and the Bennet mechanism's mobility.

Result: Identifies hypo-paradoxical linkages, which are rigid but appear mobile, and provides insights into the Bennet mechanism's mobility using the same analytical tools.

Conclusion: Existing mobility criteria such as the Chebyshev-Grübler-Kutzbach criterion are insufficient to fully characterize certain classes of linkages; nuanced tools are necessary for a better understanding of phenomena like hypo-paradoxical rigidity or unexpected mobility.

Abstract: While paradoxical linkages famously violate the Chebyshev-Grubler-Kutzbach
criterion by exhibiting unexpected mobility, we identify an opposing
phenomenon: a class of linkages that appear mobile according to the same
criterion, yet are in fact rigid. We refer to these as hypo-paradoxical
linkages, and proceed to analyze and illustrate their behavior. We use the same
tools to further explain the unexpected positive mobility of Bennet mechanism.

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces DynamiX, a simulator that models the dynamic nature of social networks, focusing on evolving relationships and user roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in social network simulations that overlook the dynamic evolution of social relationships, crucial for studying attitude dynamics and collective behavior.

Method: DynamiX incorporates a dynamic hierarchy module for core agent selection and models social relationships differently for opinion leaders and ordinary users using strategies like link prediction and inequality-oriented decision-making.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate that DynamiX significantly improves simulations of attitude evolution and collective behavior compared to static models.

Conclusion: DynamiX provides a novel approach to modeling dynamic social networks, enabling advancements in follower growth prediction and opinion leader cultivation.

Abstract: Understanding the intrinsic mechanisms of social platforms is an urgent
demand to maintain social stability. The rise of large language models provides
significant potential for social network simulations to capture attitude
dynamics and reproduce collective behaviors. However, existing studies mainly
focus on scaling up agent populations, neglecting the dynamic evolution of
social relationships. To address this gap, we introduce DynamiX, a novel
large-scale social network simulator dedicated to dynamic social network
modeling. DynamiX uses a dynamic hierarchy module for selecting core agents
with key characteristics at each timestep, enabling accurate alignment of
real-world adaptive switching of user roles. Furthermore, we design distinct
dynamic social relationship modeling strategies for different user types. For
opinion leaders, we propose an information-stream-based link prediction method
recommending potential users with similar stances, simulating homogeneous
connections, and autonomous behavior decisions. For ordinary users, we
construct an inequality-oriented behavior decision-making module, effectively
addressing unequal social interactions and capturing the patterns of
relationship adjustments driven by multi-dimensional factors. Experimental
results demonstrate that DynamiX exhibits marked improvements in attitude
evolution simulation and collective behavior analysis compared to static
networks. Besides, DynamiX opens a new theoretical perspective on follower
growth prediction, providing empirical evidence for opinion leaders
cultivation.

TL;DR: The paper examines the connection between urban morphology and human mobility, using machine learning to classify urban forms in nine U.S. metropolitan areas and linking these forms to mobility patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the relationship between urban form and transportation behaviors and address the gap in systematic classification of urban structures.

Method: Utilization of unsupervised machine learning to classify urban morphology across nine cities based on structural indicators, combined with statistical methods to analyze mobility patterns.

Result: Distinct urban morphologies have systematic effects on transport behaviors, e.g., reticular forms promote public transport use while organic forms increase car dependence. These findings are statistically significant.

Conclusion: Urban morphology meaningfully influences mobility choices, underscoring the need to account for spatial configurations in transportation planning and urban policy for sustainability.

Abstract: Urban morphology has long been recognized as a factor shaping human mobility,
yet comparative and formal classifications of urban form across metropolitan
areas remain limited. Building on theoretical principles of urban structure and
advances in unsupervised learning, we systematically classified the built
environment of nine U.S. metropolitan areas using structural indicators such as
density, connectivity, and spatial configuration. The resulting morphological
types were linked to mobility patterns through descriptive statistics, marginal
effects estimation, and post hoc statistical testing. Here we show that
distinct urban forms are systematically associated with different mobility
behaviors, such as reticular morphologies being linked to significantly higher
public transport use (marginal effect = 0.49) and reduced car dependence
(-0.41), while organic forms are associated with increased car usage (0.44),
and substantial declines in public transport (-0.47) and active mobility
(-0.30). These effects are statistically robust (p < 1e-19), highlighting that
the spatial configuration of urban areas plays a fundamental role in shaping
transportation choices. Our findings extend previous work by offering a
reproducible framework for classifying urban form and demonstrate the added
value of morphological analysis in comparative urban research. These results
suggest that urban form should be treated as a key variable in mobility
planning and provide empirical support for incorporating spatial typologies
into sustainable urban policy design.

Main category: q-bio.OT

TL;DR: The authors developed a Non-Invasive Respiratory Support (NIRS) ontology with OWL and SWRL to support reasoning and therapy recommendations in acute care. SPARQL queries validated the ontology's functionality using clinical scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to create a structured framework for representing knowledge regarding Non-Invasive Respiratory Support (NIRS) to support decision-making and improve documentation practices in acute care settings.

Method: The authors employed Web Ontology Language (OWL) to design the ontology and used Software tools like Protege. They incorporated SWRL rules for reasoning and validated the system with hypothetical patient scenarios and SPARQL queries using data from the eICU Collaborative Research Database.

Result: The resulting ontology consists of 132 classes, multiple properties, and annotations, successfully integrating standardized vocabularies. SPARQL queries confirmed that the ontology can handle rule-based reasoning and therapy recommendations effectively.

Conclusion: The study unified NIRS concepts into a comprehensive ontological framework, validated its use in hypothetical scenarios, and demonstrated its potential for standardizing clinical documentation and analysis in acute care.

Abstract: Objective: Develop a Non Invasive Respiratory Support (NIRS) ontology to
support knowledge representation in acute care settings.
  Materials and Methods: We developed the NIRS ontology using Web Ontology
Language (OWL) semantics and Protege to organize clinical concepts and
relationships. To enable rule-based clinical reasoning beyond hierarchical
structures, we added Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules. We evaluated
logical reasoning by adding 17 hypothetical patient clinical scenarios. We used
SPARQL queries and data from the Electronic Intensive Care Unit (eICU)
Collaborative Research Database to retrieve and test targeted inferences.
  Results: The ontology has 132 classes, 12 object properties, and 17 data
properties across 882 axioms that establish concept relationships. To
standardize clinical concepts, we added 350 annotations, including descriptive
definitions based on controlled vocabularies. SPARQL queries successfully
validated all test cases (rules) by retrieving appropriate patient outcomes,
for instance, a patient treated with HFNC (high-flow nasal cannula) for 2 hours
due to acute respiratory failure may avoid endotracheal intubation.
  Discussion: The NIRS ontology formally represents domain-specific concepts,
including ventilation modalities, patient characteristics, therapy parameters,
and outcomes. SPARQL query evaluations on clinical scenarios confirmed the
ability of the ontology to support rule based reasoning and therapy
recommendations, providing a foundation for consistent documentation practices,
integration into clinical data models, and advanced analysis of NIRS outcomes.
  Conclusion: We unified NIRS concepts into an ontological framework and
demonstrated its applicability through the evaluation of hypothetical patient
scenarios and alignment with standardized vocabularies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MountainLion, a multi-modal and multi-agent system leveraging large language models (LLMs) for cryptocurrency trading, integrating diverse financial data for actionable investment strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptocurrency trading involves analyzing heterogeneous data across multiple modalities, and traditional methods often lack interpretability while requiring extensive datasets.

Method: MountainLion uses specialized LLM-based agents to process textual news, candlestick charts, and trading signal charts, employing a reflection module to refine strategies through analyzing historical data.

Result: Empirical results show that MountainLion enhances technical triggers with macroeconomic and capital flow signals, providing a robust, interpretable framework that boosts returns and increases investor confidence.

Conclusion: The system effectively combines multi-modal data into dynamic, data-driven investment strategies, enhancing the quality and interpretability of trading decisions in real-time.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency trading is a challenging task requiring the integration of
heterogeneous data from multiple modalities. Traditional deep learning and
reinforcement learning approaches typically demand large training datasets and
encode diverse inputs into numerical representations, often at the cost of
interpretability. Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based agents
has demonstrated the capacity to process multi-modal data and support complex
investment decision-making. Building on these advances, we present
\textbf{MountainLion}, a multi-modal, multi-agent system for financial trading
that coordinates specialized LLM-based agents to interpret financial data and
generate investment strategies. MountainLion processes textual news,
candlestick charts, and trading signal charts to produce high-quality financial
reports, while also enabling modification of reports and investment
recommendations through data-driven user interaction and question answering. A
central reflection module analyzes historical trading signals and outcomes to
continuously refine decision processes, and the system is capable of real-time
report analysis, summarization, and dynamic adjustment of investment
strategies. Empirical results confirm that MountainLion systematically enriches
technical price triggers with contextual macroeconomic and capital flow
signals, providing a more interpretable, robust, and actionable investment
framework that improves returns and strengthens investor confidence.

*Dongfang Zhao*

Main category: math.AG

TL;DR: The paper addresses instability in token embedding spaces in LLMs by resolving singularities using a scheme-theoretic approach, ensuring geometric regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges to the manifold hypothesis and the instability caused by singularities in token embedding spaces require a new methodology.

Method: The authors use scheme-theoretic blow-ups at singular points, replacing them with exceptional divisor spaces to disambiguate token meanings.

Result: The geometric singularities around polysemous tokens are resolved, achieving a new regularized embedding space.

Conclusion: The framework suggests a shift towards dynamic computational embeddings, moving past static look-ups to enable disambiguation and stabilization.

Abstract: Recent work has provided compelling evidence challenging the foundational
manifold hypothesis for the token embedding spaces of Large Language Models
(LLMs). These findings reveal the presence of geometric singularities around
polysemous tokens, which can lead to representational instability. Existing
methodologies, which presuppose a smooth data manifold, are ill-equipped to
address such intrinsic structural flaws. In this paper, we formalize this
problem in the language of scheme theory and propose a rigorous resolution by
applying the scheme-theoretic blow-up at each singular point. This procedure
replaces a singular point in the ambient affine scheme with its exceptional
divisor, which we identify as a canonical geometric space -- a projective space
of directions -- that houses the disambiguated semantic meanings of the token.
This process of ``representational desingularization'' constructs a new
geometric landscape for embeddings. We prove a formal theorem guaranteeing the
geometric regularization of this new space, showing that the original
pathologies are resolved. Finally, we outline the architectural implications of
our framework, arguing for a paradigm shift from static look-ups to dynamic,
geometrically-grounded computation.

TL;DR: Methamphetamine addiction assessment and rTMS treatment evaluation often depend on subjective methods. NeuroCLIP, a deep learning framework, integrates EEG and fNIRS data to improve biomarker reliability and treatment tracking, demonstrating strong correlations with craving scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the global health challenge of methamphetamine dependence and the limitations of subjective self-reports and single-modality neuroimaging methods in assessing addiction and treatment efficacy.

Method: NeuroCLIP combines EEG and fNIRS data through a progressive deep learning strategy to create a multimodal biomarker offering greater accuracy and reliability for addiction neuroscience.

Result: NeuroCLIP significantly improves discrimination between methamphetamine-dependent individuals and healthy controls, supports rTMS treatment assessment, and correlates strongly with psychometrically validated craving scores.

Conclusion: The study concludes that NeuroCLIP is a robust and trustworthy tool for addiction neuroscience, enhancing the objective evaluation of methamphetamine dependence and treatment effects, with potential clinical applications.

Abstract: Methamphetamine dependence poses a significant global health challenge, yet
its assessment and the evaluation of treatments like repetitive transcranial
magnetic stimulation (rTMS) frequently depend on subjective self-reports, which
may introduce uncertainties. While objective neuroimaging modalities such as
electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
offer alternatives, their individual limitations and the reliance on
conventional, often hand-crafted, feature extraction can compromise the
reliability of derived biomarkers. To overcome these limitations, we propose
NeuroCLIP, a novel deep learning framework integrating simultaneously recorded
EEG and fNIRS data through a progressive learning strategy. This approach
offers a robust and trustworthy biomarker for methamphetamine addiction.
Validation experiments show that NeuroCLIP significantly improves
discriminative capabilities among the methamphetamine-dependent individuals and
healthy controls compared to models using either EEG or only fNIRS alone.
Furthermore, the proposed framework facilitates objective, brain-based
evaluation of rTMS treatment efficacy, demonstrating measurable shifts in
neural patterns towards healthy control profiles after treatment. Critically,
we establish the trustworthiness of the multimodal data-driven biomarker by
showing its strong correlation with psychometrically validated craving scores.
These findings suggest that biomarker derived from EEG-fNIRS data via NeuroCLIP
offers enhanced robustness and reliability over single-modality approaches,
providing a valuable tool for addiction neuroscience research and potentially
improving clinical assessments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in achieving cooperative gains in channel estimation and positioning for near-field sparse XL-MIMO systems.

Method: A two-stage deep learning framework is proposed, using predicted user coordinates from a first-stage positioning model to improve accuracy in a second-stage channel estimation model. The framework utilizes the CP-Mamba network combining Mamba architecture with U-shaped convolutional network features for better spatial and temporal capturing.

Result: The proposed CP-Mamba architecture demonstrated superior performance in channel estimation and positioning accuracy compared to conventional methods, with sparse arrays performing better than compact arrays.

Conclusion: The study underscores the benefit of integrating deep learning approaches and sparse arrays to enhance both channel estimation and positioning in XL-MIMO systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates joint channel estimation and positioning in
near-field sparse extra-large multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO)
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. To achieve
cooperative gains between channel estimation and positioning, we propose a deep
learning-based two-stage framework comprising positioning and channel
estimation. In the positioning stage, the user's coordinates are predicted and
utilized in the channel estimation stage, thereby enhancing the accuracy of
channel estimation. Within this framework, we propose a U-shaped Mamba
architecture for channel estimation and positioning, termed as CP-Mamba. This
network integrates the strengths of the Mamba model with the structural
advantages of U-shaped convolutional networks, enabling effective capture of
local spatial features and long-range temporal dependencies of the channel.
Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage approach
with CP-Mamba architecture outperforms existing baseline methods. Moreover,
sparse arrays (SA) exhibit significantly superior performance in both channel
estimation and positioning accuracy compared to conventional compact arrays.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve depth reconstruction accuracy and multi-target separation in iToF systems using a resource-efficient method.

Method: The method uses a single modulation frequency with phase shifts, accounts for lens distortion, and applies K-Means clustering for optimized sparse recovery.

Result: Experiments show superior reconstruction accuracy and robustness compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The method is effective and efficient, outperforming others without requiring extra hardware complexity.

Abstract: We propose a novel compressed sensing method to improve the depth
reconstruction accuracy and multi-target separation capability of indirect
Time-of-Flight (iToF) systems. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on
hardware modifications, complex modulation, or cumbersome data-driven
reconstruction, our method operates with a single modulation frequency and
constructs the sensing matrix using multiple phase shifts and narrow-duty-cycle
continuous waves. During matrix construction, we further account for pixel-wise
range variation caused by lens distortion, making the sensing matrix better
aligned with actual modulation response characteristics. To enhance sparse
recovery, we apply K-Means clustering to the distance response dictionary and
constrain atom selection within each cluster during the OMP process, which
effectively reduces the search space and improves solution stability.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
traditional approaches in both reconstruction accuracy and robustness, without
requiring any additional hardware changes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortage of skilled healthcare workers in regions and the underexplored area of pediatric respiratory sound classification, particularly for children under 6 years old.

Method: The proposed method employs a multistage hybrid model combining CNN-extracted features with Transformer-based attention architecture, using scalogram images for classification tasks at both full recording and individual breath event levels.

Result: The model achieved an overall score of 0.9039 for binary and 0.8448 for multiclass event classification, outperforming previous models by 3.81% and 5.94% in ternary and multiclass classification at the recording level.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework provides a scalable, high-performance solution for pediatric respiratory disease diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Automated analysis of lung sound auscultation is essential for monitoring
respiratory health, especially in regions facing a shortage of skilled
healthcare workers. While respiratory sound classification has been widely
studied in adults, its ap plication in pediatric populations, particularly in
children aged <6 years, remains an underexplored area. The developmental
changes in pediatric lungs considerably alter the acoustic proper ties of
respiratory sounds, necessitating specialized classification approaches
tailored to this age group. To address this, we propose a multistage hybrid
CNN-Transformer framework that combines CNN-extracted features with an
attention-based architecture to classify pediatric respiratory diseases using
scalogram images from both full recordings and individual breath events. Our
model achieved an overall score of 0.9039 in binary event classifi cation and
0.8448 in multiclass event classification by employing class-wise focal loss to
address data imbalance. At the recording level, the model attained scores of
0.720 for ternary and 0.571 for multiclass classification. These scores
outperform the previous best models by 3.81% and 5.94%, respectively. This
approach offers a promising solution for scalable pediatric respiratory disease
diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for modeling vector-valued environmental data on 2D manifolds using discrete intrinsic Gaussian processes derived from triangular mesh-based differential operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Environmental data like wind fields or ocean currents are observed discretely but evolve over continuous spaces, requiring methods that respect geometry and curvature.

Method: Develop discrete intrinsic Gaussian processes using two-dimensional manifold representations embedded as triangular meshes, leveraging discrete differential operators.

Result: The approach captures harmonic flows, integrates boundary conditions, and models non-stationary data. Applications include downscaling wind data globally and inferring sparse ocean currents.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is flexible, applicable to any 2D mesh, respects manifold geometry, and effectively handles both stationary and non-stationary problems.

Abstract: Though the underlying fields associated with vector-valued environmental data
are continuous, observations themselves are discrete. For example, climate
models typically output grid-based representations of wind fields or ocean
currents, and these are often downscaled to a discrete set of points. By
treating the area of interest as a two-dimensional manifold that can be
represented as a triangular mesh and embedded in Euclidean space, this work
shows that discrete intrinsic Gaussian processes for vector-valued data can be
developed from discrete differential operators defined with respect to a mesh.
These Gaussian processes account for the geometry and curvature of the manifold
whilst also providing a flexible and practical formulation that can be readily
applied to any two-dimensional mesh. We show that these models can capture
harmonic flows, incorporate boundary conditions, and model non-stationary data.
Finally, we apply these models to downscaling stationary and non-stationary
gridded wind data on the globe, and to inference of ocean currents from sparse
observations in bounded domains.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the lack of theoretical analysis for LASSO in Beta regression with high-dimensional predictors, providing a bound on the l1-error and a debiasing method for confidence intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the theoretical gap in analyzing LASSO for Beta regression in high-dimensional prediction settings, particularly considering non-convex negative log-likelihood in such setups.

Method: The authors use a framework for analyzing stationary points near the target parameter, derive a non-asymptotic l1-error bound, propose a debiasing approach for confidence intervals, and develop a proximal gradient algorithm for optimization.

Result: Theoretical findings are validated with simulation studies, and practical utility is demonstrated via a real dataset predicting county-level incarceration proportions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances the theoretical understanding and practical application of LASSO in Beta regression with high-dimensional predictors, addressing challenges like non-convex likelihood and parameter estimation confidence.

Abstract: Beta regression is commonly employed when the outcome variable is a
proportion. Since its conception, the approach has been widely used in
applications spanning various scientific fields. A series of extensions have
been proposed over time, several of which address variable selection and
penalized estimation, e.g., with an $\ell_1$-penalty (LASSO). However, a
theoretical analysis of this popular approach in the context of Beta regression
with high-dimensional predictors is lacking. In this paper, we aim to close
this gap. A particular challenge arises from the non-convexity of the
associated negative log-likelihood, which we address by resorting to a
framework for analyzing stationary points in a neighborhood of the target
parameter. Leveraging this framework, we derive a non-asymptotic bound on the
$\ell_1$-error of such stationary points. In addition, we propose a debiasing
approach to construct confidence intervals for the regression parameters. A
proximal gradient algorithm is devised for optimizing the resulting penalized
negative log-likelihood function. Our theoretical analysis is corroborated via
simulation studies, and a real data example concerning the prediction of
county-level proportions of incarceration is presented to showcase the
practical utility of our methodology.

($1/n$ for $n$ data points) convergence rates when specialized to the popular
Drift Diffusion Model (DDM), but are broadly applicable to generalizations of
the DDM as well as to alternative models of decision making that make use of
response time data. The paper develops an empirical application to an
experiment on intertemporal choice, showing that the use of response times
delivers predictive accuracy and matters for the estimation of economically
relevant parameters.

### [635] [ChoreoMuse: Robust Music-to-Dance Video Generation with Style Transfer and Beat-Adherent Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19836)
*Xuanchen Wang,Heng Wang,Weidong Cai*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ChoreoMuse is a diffusion-based framework for generating style-controllable, high-quality dance videos, harmonizing musical rhythm with user-defined choreography styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for automated choreography generation that adapts to diverse musical styles and individual dancer characteristics has grown, but existing methods fail to fully harmonize dance videos with musical rhythm and intended choreography styles.

Method: ChoreoMuse employs SMPL format parameters as intermediaries, utilizes a novel music encoder MotionTune to extract motion cues from audio, and supports resolution-agnostic dance generation with style control. Two new metrics are introduced for quantitative evaluation of alignment with musical and choreographic styles.

Result: Extensive experiments show that ChoreoMuse achieves state-of-the-art performance in video quality, beat alignment, dance diversity, and adherence to stylistic cues.

Conclusion: ChoreoMuse is a promising solution for creative contexts, enabling automated style-controllable, music-aligned dance video generation suitable for diverse real-world applications.

Abstract: Modern artistic productions increasingly demand automated choreography
generation that adapts to diverse musical styles and individual dancer
characteristics. Existing approaches often fail to produce high-quality dance
videos that harmonize with both musical rhythm and user-defined choreography
styles, limiting their applicability in real-world creative contexts. To
address this gap, we introduce ChoreoMuse, a diffusion-based framework that
uses SMPL format parameters and their variation version as intermediaries
between music and video generation, thereby overcoming the usual constraints
imposed by video resolution. Critically, ChoreoMuse supports
style-controllable, high-fidelity dance video generation across diverse musical
genres and individual dancer characteristics, including the flexibility to
handle any reference individual at any resolution. Our method employs a novel
music encoder MotionTune to capture motion cues from audio, ensuring that the
generated choreography closely follows the beat and expressive qualities of the
input music. To quantitatively evaluate how well the generated dances match
both musical and choreographic styles, we introduce two new metrics that
measure alignment with the intended stylistic cues. Extensive experiments
confirm that ChoreoMuse achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple
dimensions, including video quality, beat alignment, dance diversity, and style
adherence, demonstrating its potential as a robust solution for a wide range of
creative applications. Video results can be found on our project page:

### [636] [GSCache: Real-Time Radiance Caching for Volume Path Tracing using 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19718)
*David Bauer,Qi Wu,Hamid Gadirov,Kwan-Liu Ma*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a real-time radiance caching method for path-traced volume rendering, improving image quality while keeping rendering costs low.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in photorealistic volume rendering for scientific visualization, particularly slow rendering and high pixel variance due to Monte Carlo integration.

Method: A novel radiance caching approach is proposed using 3D Gaussian splatting as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache that adapts dynamically to scene changes and is trainable on the fly.

Result: The proposed method outperforms baseline path tracers and state-of-the-art neural radiance caching in both rendering quality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: This approach enhances volumetric rendering quality and efficiency for scientific visualization, providing a practical and integrable solution for real-time applications.

Abstract: Real-time path tracing is rapidly becoming the standard for rendering in
entertainment and professional applications. In scientific visualization,
volume rendering plays a crucial role in helping researchers analyze and
interpret complex 3D data. Recently, photorealistic rendering techniques have
gained popularity in scientific visualization, yet they face significant
challenges. One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and
high pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we
introduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering.
Our method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D
Gaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache.
This cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to
changes in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer
functions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality
images without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare
it against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event
estimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching. Through both
quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our path-space
radiance cache is a robust solution that is easy to integrate and significantly
enhances the rendering quality of volumetric visualization applications while
maintaining comparable computational efficiency.

### [637] [Taking Language Embedded 3D Gaussian Splatting into the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19830)
*Yuze Wang,Yue Qi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for open-vocabulary understanding of 3D architectural structures from unconstrained photo collections, extending 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) techniques and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to bridge the gap in immersive understanding of architectural styles and structures, addressing the limitations of current methods that rely on static text-image pairs.

Method: The proposed framework uses 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) extended with language-guided features. It incorporates multi-appearance CLIP feature extraction, uncertainty maps, a transient-aware autoencoder, and a 3DGS representation with post-ensemble strategies for learning and fusing features.

Result: The framework significantly improves open-vocabulary segmentation, demonstrated through a new benchmark dataset (PT-OVS). It also supports interactive applications like roaming, architectural style recognition, and scene editing.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances open-vocabulary scene understanding and segmentation from unconstrained photo collections, enabling more immersive and functional applications for 3D architectural exploration.

Abstract: Recent advances in leveraging large-scale Internet photo collections for 3D
reconstruction have enabled immersive virtual exploration of landmarks and
historic sites worldwide. However, little attention has been given to the
immersive understanding of architectural styles and structural knowledge, which
remains largely confined to browsing static text-image pairs. Therefore, can we
draw inspiration from 3D in-the-wild reconstruction techniques and use
unconstrained photo collections to create an immersive approach for
understanding the 3D structure of architectural components? To this end, we
extend language embedded 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and propose a novel
framework for open-vocabulary scene understanding from unconstrained photo
collections. Specifically, we first render multiple appearance images from the
same viewpoint as the unconstrained image with the reconstructed radiance
field, then extract multi-appearance CLIP features and two types of language
feature uncertainty maps-transient and appearance uncertainty-derived from the
multi-appearance features to guide the subsequent optimization process. Next,
we propose a transient uncertainty-aware autoencoder, a multi-appearance
language field 3DGS representation, and a post-ensemble strategy to effectively
compress, learn, and fuse language features from multiple appearances. Finally,
to quantitatively evaluate our method, we introduce PT-OVS, a new benchmark
dataset for assessing open-vocabulary segmentation performance on unconstrained
photo collections. Experimental results show that our method outperforms
existing methods, delivering accurate open-vocabulary segmentation and enabling
applications such as interactive roaming with open-vocabulary queries,
architectural style pattern recognition, and 3D scene editing.

### [638] [Neural Shell Texture Splatting: More Details and Fewer Primitives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20200)
*Xin Zhang,Anpei Chen,Jincheng Xiong,Pinxuan Dai,Yujun Shen,Weiwei Xu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel Gaussian Splitting-based approach that addresses the high primitive requirement by separating geometry and texture representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to solve the inefficiency in current Gaussian splatting techniques, which necessitate a large number of primitives due to the entanglement of geometry and texture properties.

Method: A neural shell texture is introduced as a global representation to encode texture around the surface, combining geometry and texture sampling via Gaussian primitives.

Result: This approach achieves high parameter efficiency, improved texture detail reconstruction, and facilitates textured mesh extraction using fewer primitives.

Conclusion: Separating geometry and texture in Gaussian Splatting results in a more efficient and effective method for novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Gaussian splatting techniques have shown promising results in novel view
synthesis, achieving high fidelity and efficiency. However, their high
reconstruction quality comes at the cost of requiring a large number of
primitives. We identify this issue as stemming from the entanglement of
geometry and appearance in Gaussian Splatting. To address this, we introduce a
neural shell texture, a global representation that encodes texture information
around the surface. We use Gaussian primitives as both a geometric
representation and texture field samplers, efficiently splatting texture
features into image space. Our evaluation demonstrates that this
disentanglement enables high parameter efficiency, fine texture detail
reconstruction, and easy textured mesh extraction, all while using
significantly fewer primitives.

TL;DR: This paper presents a memristor-based Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture with efficient, scalable training and high accuracy across multiple tasks, evaluated using various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for ultra-low-energy computations suitable for battery-powered intelligent devices and improve efficiency and scalability in SNNs.

Method: Introduced a circuit-level memristive SNN architecture with a novel in-situ supervised learning algorithm inspired by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), enabling lateral inhibition and efficient synapse updates without external control hardware.

Result: The system achieves perfect pattern recognition and high classification accuracies of 99.11% (Iris) and 97.9% (BCW), robustness with 93.4% recognition under 20% input noise, and analyzes the impact of device faults and variations.

Conclusion: The proposed SNN architecture showcases scalability, efficiency, robustness, and suitability for energy-constrained intelligent systems.

Abstract: Memristor-based Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with temporal spike encoding
enable ultra-low-energy computation, making them ideal for battery-powered
intelligent devices. This paper presents a circuit-level memristive spiking
neural network (SNN) architecture trained using a proposed novel supervised
in-situ learning algorithm inspired by spike-timing-dependent plasticity
(STDP). The proposed architecture efficiently implements lateral inhibition and
the refractory period, eliminating the need for external microcontrollers or
ancillary control hardware. All synapses of the winning neurons are updated in
parallel, enhancing training efficiency. The modular design ensures scalability
with respect to input data dimensions and output class count. The SNN is
evaluated in LTspice for pattern recognition (using 5x3 binary images) and
classification tasks using the Iris and Breast Cancer Wisconsin (BCW) datasets.
During testing, the system achieved perfect pattern recognition and high
classification accuracies of 99.11\% (Iris) and 97.9\% (BCW). Additionally, it
has demonstrated robustness, maintaining an average recognition rate of 93.4\%
under 20\% input noise. The impact of stuck-at-conductance faults and memristor
device variations was also analyzed.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces TS-Insight, a visual tool to explain and debug Thompson Sampling (TS)-based algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Debugging and trust issues arise due to the "black box" nature of probabilistic TS-based algorithms in sensitive decision-making areas.

Method: A visual analytics tool, TS-Insight, is developed with plots detailing posterior evolution, evidence counts, and sampling outcomes for algorithm transparency.

Result: TS-Insight helps explain and diagnose exploration/exploitation decisions, enhancing trust and deployment efficiency.

Conclusion: TS-Insight is effective for improving interpretability, debugging, and deployment of TS algorithms in sensitive domains.

Abstract: Thompson Sampling (TS) and its variants are powerful Multi-Armed Bandit
algorithms used to balance exploration and exploitation strategies in active
learning. Yet, their probabilistic nature often turns them into a ``black
box'', hindering debugging and trust. We introduce TS-Insight, a visual
analytics tool explicitly designed to shed light on the internal decision
mechanisms of Thompson Sampling-based algorithms, for model developers. It
comprises multiple plots, tracing for each arm the evolving posteriors,
evidence counts, and sampling outcomes, enabling the verification, diagnosis,
and explainability of exploration/exploitation dynamics. This tool aims at
fostering trust and facilitating effective debugging and deployment in complex
binary decision-making scenarios especially in sensitive domains requiring
interpretable decision-making.

### [641] [The Architecture of Cognitive Amplification: Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding as a Resolution to the Comfort-Growth Paradox in Human-AI Cognitive Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19483)
*Giuseppe Riva*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding to address the "comfort-growth paradox," ensuring AI systems promote cognitive development rather than causing intellectual stagnation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the tension wherein AI's ease of use can lead to intellectual complacency, sidestepping its potential to amplify human cognition.

Method: The authors propose a framework integrating Progressive Autonomy, Adaptive Personalization, and Cognitive Load Optimization, inspired by Vygotskian theories and educational principles.

Result: The approach has shown evidence of improving skill acquisition, self-regulation, and higher-order thinking across various domains like education, creativity, and healthcare.

Conclusion: Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding prioritizes growth and autonomous learning in human-AI interaction, mitigating risks of dependency, skill atrophy, and bias, thereby amplifying human cognition effectively.

Abstract: AI systems now function as cognitive extensions, evolving from tools to
active cognitive collaborators within human-AI integrated systems. While these
systems can amplify cognition - enhancing problem-solving, learning, and
creativity - they present a fundamental "comfort-growth paradox": AI's
user-friendly nature may foster intellectual stagnation by minimizing cognitive
friction necessary for development. As AI aligns with user preferences and
provides frictionless assistance, it risks inducing cognitive complacency
rather than promoting growth. We introduce Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding to
resolve this paradox - reconceptualizing AI from convenient assistant to
dynamic mentor. Drawing from Vygotskian theories, educational scaffolding
principles, and AI ethics, our framework integrates three dimensions: (1)
Progressive Autonomy, where AI support gradually fades as user competence
increases; (2) Adaptive Personalization, tailoring assistance to individual
needs and learning trajectories; and (3) Cognitive Load Optimization, balancing
mental effort to maximize learning while minimizing unnecessary complexity.
Research across educational, workplace, creative, and healthcare domains
supports this approach, demonstrating accelerated skill acquisition, improved
self-regulation, and enhanced higher-order thinking. The framework includes
safeguards against risks like dependency, skill atrophy, and bias
amplification. By prioritizing cognitive development over convenience in
human-AI interaction, Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding offers a pathway toward
genuinely amplified cognition while safeguarding autonomous thought and
continuous learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To link creativity as described in the UDHR with design principles for Computational Creativity systems, viewing creativity as a human right.

Method: Examining five articles from the UDHR, demonstrating with examples, and deriving design considerations for CC systems.

Result: Key relationships between creativity and CC systems are identified through the lens of the UDHR articles.

Conclusion: Creativity, as part of the Fourth Generation of Human Rights, has significant implications for CC system design and should integrate evolving interactions with intelligent entities.

Abstract: We investigate creativity that is underlined in the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights (UDHR) to present design considerations for Computational
Creativity (CC) systems. We find this declaration to describe creativity in
salient aspects and bring to light creativity as a Human Right attributed to
the Fourth Generation of such rights. This generation of rights attributes CC
systems and the evolving nature of interaction with entities of shared
intelligence. Our methodology examines five of thirty articles from the UDHR
and demonstrates each article with actualizations concluding with design

*Gabriel Recchia,Chatrik Singh Mangat,Jinu Nyachhyon,Mridul Sharma,Callum Canavan,Dylan Epstein-Gross,Muhammed Abdulbari*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper studies scalable oversight protocols for human evaluators of advanced AI models and finds no clear advantage for simple oversight protocols, with observed biases among evaluators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalable oversight aims to help human evaluators audit AI models that are more capable than themselves, but human biases can still lead to systematic errors.

Method: Two studies were conducted to test simple oversight protocols, where human evaluators assessed AI answers. Study 1 involved using arguments both for and against answers, and Study 2 investigated the effect of participant confidence after online research. Data from prior work was reanalyzed as well.

Result: The tested oversight protocols showed no clear advantage. Study 1 showed slightly improved accuracy when presenting arguments for both answers in cases where the AI was wrong, while Study 2 highlighted increased confidence—even in incorrect system answers. Reanalysis revealed earlier positive results relied on knowledge absent from the tested models.

Conclusion: Simple oversight protocols are not clearly robust or advantageous, and their effectiveness may diminish as AI model capabilities improve. Future work should focus on addressing evaluator biases and ensuring oversight mechanisms scale with problem difficulty and AI capabilities.

Abstract: Scalable oversight protocols aim to empower evaluators to accurately verify
AI models more capable than themselves. However, human evaluators are subject
to biases that can lead to systematic errors. We conduct two studies examining
the performance of simple oversight protocols where evaluators know that the
model is "correct most of the time, but not all of the time". We find no
overall advantage for the tested protocols, although in Study 1, showing
arguments in favor of both answers improves accuracy in cases where the model
is incorrect. In Study 2, participants in both groups become more confident in
the system's answers after conducting online research, even when those answers
are incorrect. We also reanalyze data from prior work that was more optimistic
about simple protocols, finding that human evaluators possessing knowledge
absent from models likely contributed to their positive results--an advantage
that diminishes as models continue to scale in capability. These findings
underscore the importance of testing the degree to which oversight protocols
are robust to evaluator biases, whether they outperform simple deference to the
model under evaluation, and whether their performance scales with increasing
problem difficulty and model capability.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChartGen, a pipeline to convert chart images into python plotting scripts, and releases a substantial synthetic dataset to aid research in chart understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chart-to-code reconstruction is a critical task for enhancing the understanding of data visualizations by recovering machine-readable plotting scripts, but existing benchmarks focus only on chart questions or summaries.

Method: ChartGen uses a vision-language model (VLM) to reconstruct images into scripts, and a code-oriented large language model (LLM) iteratively refines them to generate a 222.5K dataset of chart-image code pairs.

Result: ChartGen builds and publicly releases a diverse dataset from 13K chart images and evaluates six vision-language models, highlighting gaps and opportunities for development in chart-to-code tasks.

Conclusion: ChartGen and the accompanying dataset demonstrate significant potential for improving robustness in chart understanding and code generation, aiming to advance research in this field.

Abstract: Chart-to-code reconstruction -- the task of recovering executable plotting
scripts from chart images -- provides important insights into a model's ability
to ground data visualizations in precise, machine-readable form. Yet many
existing multimodal benchmarks largely focus primarily on answering questions
about charts or summarizing them. To bridge this gap, we present ChartGen, a
fully-automated pipeline for code-guided synthetic chart generation. Starting
from seed chart images, ChartGen (i) prompts a vision-language model (VLM) to
reconstruct each image into a python script, and (ii) iteratively augments that
script with a code-oriented large language model (LLM). Using ChartGen, we
create 222.5K unique chart-image code pairs from 13K seed chart images, and
present an open-source synthetic chart dataset covering 27 chart types, 11
plotting libraries, and multiple data modalities (image, code, text, CSV,
DocTags). From this corpus, we curate a held-out chart-to-code evaluation
subset of 4.3K chart image-code pairs, and evaluate six open-weight VLMs (3B -
26B parameters), highlighting substantial room for progress. We release the
pipeline, prompts, and the dataset to help accelerate efforts towards robust
chart understanding and vision-conditioned code generation:

TL;DR: The paper introduces the PSYA framework, which uses advanced emotional and cognitive modeling to enhance the authenticity of generative agents in simulating human behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks lack nuanced emotional modeling and focus mainly on task-specific behaviors, limiting realistic human behavior simulations.

Method: The PSYA framework is built upon the Cognitive Triangle model and includes Feeling, Thought, and Action modules to simulate emotions, cognition, and behavior. It was evaluated using daily life simulations across five psychological experiments.

Result: The PSYA framework demonstrated natural, consistent, and credible behavior patterns, successfully replicating human experimental outcomes.

Conclusion: PSYA offers a sophisticated approach to emotional and cognitive modeling for generative agents and serves as an alternative to human participants in psychological research.

Abstract: Generative agents have made significant progress in simulating human
behavior, but existing frameworks often simplify emotional modeling and focus
primarily on specific tasks, limiting the authenticity of the simulation. Our
work proposes the Psychological-mechanism Agent (PSYA) framework, based on the
Cognitive Triangle (Feeling-Thought-Action), designed to more accurately
simulate human behavior. The PSYA consists of three core modules: the Feeling
module (using a layer model of affect to simulate changes in short-term,
medium-term, and long-term emotions), the Thought module (based on the Triple
Network Model to support goal-directed and spontaneous thinking), and the
Action module (optimizing agent behavior through the integration of emotions,
needs and plans). To evaluate the framework's effectiveness, we conducted daily
life simulations and extended the evaluation metrics to self-influence,
one-influence, and group-influence, selection five classic psychological
experiments for simulation. The results show that the PSYA framework generates
more natural, consistent, diverse, and credible behaviors, successfully
replicating human experimental outcomes. Our work provides a richer and more
accurate emotional and cognitive modeling approach for generative agents and
offers an alternative to human participants in psychological experiments.

TL;DR: This paper critiques current focuses in AI art in HCI research and suggests a shift towards documenting the origins and evolution of artistic style.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misunderstanding in HCI research that overlooks the human-centered processes behind artistic value formation in AI-generated art.

Method: Examination of historical precedents and critique of current AI systems' handling of artistic production.

Result: Highlights how current AI systems oversimplify human creative struggle and outlines a reframed role for HCI in generative AI, emphasizing stylistic documentation.

Conclusion: HCI should prioritize developing tools for documenting creative origins and stylistic evolution rather than perfecting AI-generated aesthetic appearances.

Abstract: As AI art generation becomes increasingly sophisticated, HCI research has
focused primarily on questions of detection, authenticity, and automation. This
paper argues that such approaches fundamentally misunderstand how artistic
value emerges from the concerns that drive human image production. Through
examination of historical precedents, we demonstrate that artistic style is not
only visual appearance but the resolution of creative struggle, as artists
wrestle with influence and technical constraints to develop unique ways of
seeing. Current AI systems flatten these human choices into reproducible
patterns without preserving their provenance. We propose that HCI's role lies
not only in perfecting visual output, but in developing means to document the
origins and evolution of artistic style as it appears within generated visual
traces. This reframing suggests new technical directions for HCI research in
generative AI, focused on automatic documentation of stylistic lineage and
creative choice rather than simple reproduction of aesthetic effects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of interpretability and multi-task capability in LLMs for domain-specific needs, such as myopia, and to demonstrate real-world application of LLMs in patient education.

Method: ChatMyopia integrates LLMs, an image classification tool, and a knowledge base built from literature, expert opinions, and guidelines. It was validated through image grading tasks, question-based tests, and human evaluations, along with a randomized controlled trial.

Result: ChatMyopia outperformed traditional leaflets in improving patient satisfaction across multiple metrics, such as empathy, accuracy, and disease awareness during a randomized controlled trial involving 70 participants.

Conclusion: ChatMyopia is a scalable and interpretable AI tool that enhances patient education and satisfaction, demonstrating promise in primary eye care settings for facilitating better communication and disease awareness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for tailored healthcare
communication but face challenges in interpretability and multi-task
integration particularly for domain-specific needs like myopia, and their
real-world effectiveness as patient education tools has yet to be demonstrated.
Here, we introduce ChatMyopia, an LLM-based AI agent designed to address text
and image-based inquiries related to myopia. To achieve this, ChatMyopia
integrates an image classification tool and a retrieval-augmented knowledge
base built from literature, expert consensus, and clinical guidelines. Myopic
maculopathy grading task, single question examination and human evaluations
validated its ability to deliver personalized, accurate, and safe responses to
myopia-related inquiries with high scalability and interpretability. In a
randomized controlled trial (n=70, NCT06607822), ChatMyopia significantly
improved patient satisfaction compared to traditional leaflets, enhancing
patient education in accuracy, empathy, disease awareness, and patient-eyecare
practitioner communication. These findings highlight ChatMyopia's potential as
a valuable supplement to enhance patient education and improve satisfaction
with medical services in primary eye care settings.

TL;DR: This paper explores the influence of societal norms on authentic self-expression, introducing a metric called Gaze Pressure Index and presenting its applications for improving AI models and HCI design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address societal challenges related to authenticity, interpersonal interactions, and prosocial behavior, considering marginalized and intersectional perspectives.

Method: The study uses postmodern philosophy and psychology concepts to explore the impact of societal gaze across marginalized groups. It analyzes redacted Reddit posts and introduces a mathematical metric to model conversational dynamics.

Result: The research proposes the Gaze Pressure Index (GPI)-Diff Composite Metric and provides an equation for training LLMs. It also builds an argument for inclusive HCI design, grounded in neuro-plasticity principles.

Conclusion: The findings offer a novel approach to fostering authenticity and inclusivity in AI systems and highlight the importance of creating affirming human-computer interaction environments.

Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence provides an opportunity to
create psychological spaciousness in society. Spaciousness is defined as the
ability to hold diverse interpersonal interactions and forms the basis for
vulnerability that leads to authenticity that leads to prosocial behaviors and
thus to societal harmony. This paper demonstrates an attempt to quantify, the
human conditioning to subconsciously modify authentic self-expression to fit
the norms of the dominant culture. Gaze is explored across various marginalized
and intersectional groups, using concepts from postmodern philosophy and
psychology. The effects of gaze are studied through analyzing a few redacted
Reddit posts, only to be discussed in discourse and not endorsement. A
mathematical formulation for the Gaze Pressure Index (GPI)-Diff Composite
Metric is presented to model the analysis of two sets of conversational spaces
in relation to one another. The outcome includes an equation to train Large
Language Models (LLMs) - the working mechanism of AI products such as Chat-GPT;
and an argument for affirming and inclusive HCI, based on the equation, is
presented. The argument is supported by a few principles of Neuro-plasticity,
The brain's lifelong capacity to rewire.

*Xinzheng Wu,Junyi Chen,Peiyi Wang,Shunxiang Chen,Yong Shen*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces the RISEE dataset, comprising human subjective evaluations and eye-tracking data, addressing shortcomings in existing naturalistic and simulated driving datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate human cognition into autonomous driving R&D and V&V phases and to address limitations in current datasets which lack human-related information and sufficient safety-critical scenarios.

Method: The authors combined drone-based traffic video recording and simulation-based data reconstruction. The scenarios were assessed by 101 participants, with eye-tracking and subjective risk ratings collected during the process.

Result: The study retained 3567 subjective risk ratings and 2045 qualified eye-tracking data segments, gathered across 179 scenarios.

Conclusion: The RISEE dataset offers improved validation data by incorporating human evaluations and eye-tracking, enhancing safety-critical scenario assessment in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: In the research and development (R&D) and verification and validation (V&V)
phases of autonomous driving decision-making and planning systems, it is
necessary to integrate human factors to achieve decision-making and evaluation
that align with human cognition. However, most existing datasets primarily
focus on vehicle motion states and trajectories, neglecting human-related
information. In addition, current naturalistic driving datasets lack sufficient
safety-critical scenarios while simulated datasets suffer from low
authenticity. To address these issues, this paper constructs the Risk-Informed
Subjective Evaluation and Eye-tracking (RISEE) dataset which specifically
contains human subjective evaluations and eye-tracking data apart from regular
naturalistic driving trajectories. By leveraging the complementary advantages
of drone-based (high realism and extensive scenario coverage) and
simulation-based (high safety and reproducibility) data collection methods, we
first conduct drone-based traffic video recording at a highway ramp merging
area. After that, the manually selected highly interactive scenarios are
reconstructed in simulation software, and drivers' first-person view (FPV)
videos are generated, which are then viewed and evaluated by recruited
participants. During the video viewing process, participants' eye-tracking data
is collected. After data processing and filtering, 3567 valid subjective risk
ratings from 101 participants across 179 scenarios are retained, along with
2045 qualified eye-tracking data segments. The collected data and examples of
the generated FPV videos are available in our website.

### [650] [Visual Analytics Using Tensor Unified Linear Comparative Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19988)
*Naoki Okami,Kazuki Miyake,Naohisa Sakamoto,Jorji Nonaka,Takanori Fujiwara*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces TULCA, a tensor decomposition method for comparative analysis, and provides a visual analytics interface to aid interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing tensors and understanding their structural differences is crucial for complex data analysis, but current methods lack flexibility for comparative analysis.

Method: The authors propose TULCA by extending ULCA to tensors, combining discriminant analysis and contrastive learning for decomposition and providing 2D visualizations of core tensors.

Result: TULCA was validated through computational evaluations and case studies, showing its ability to analyze and visualize tensor data effectively.

Conclusion: TULCA and its associated interface enhance the ability to perform flexible comparative tensor analysis and visualization, supporting more informed decision-making for analysts.

Abstract: Comparing tensors and identifying their (dis)similar structures is
fundamental in understanding the underlying phenomena for complex data. Tensor
decomposition methods help analysts extract tensors' essential characteristics
and aid in visual analytics for tensors. In contrast to dimensionality
reduction (DR) methods designed only for analyzing a matrix (i.e., second-order
tensor), existing tensor decomposition methods do not support flexible
comparative analysis. To address this analysis limitation, we introduce a new
tensor decomposition method, named tensor unified linear comparative analysis
(TULCA), by extending its DR counterpart, ULCA, for tensor analysis. TULCA
integrates discriminant analysis and contrastive learning schemes for tensor
decomposition, enabling flexible comparison of tensors. We also introduce an
effective method to visualize a core tensor extracted from TULCA into a set of
2D visualizations. We integrate TULCA's functionalities into a visual analytics
interface to support analysts in interpreting and refining the TULCA results.
We demonstrate the efficacy of TULCA and the visual analytics interface with
computational evaluations and two case studies, including an analysis of log
data collected from a supercomputer.

### [651] [Understanding Bias in Perceiving Dimensionality Reduction Projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20805)
*Seoyoung Doh,Hyeon Jeon,Sungbok Shin,Ghulam Jilani Quadri,Nam Wook Kim,Jinwook Seo*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper investigates how a bias towards visually interesting projections can overshadow structural faithfulness in dimensionality reduction visualizations. A user study was conducted to identify this issue and strategies to mitigate it are discussed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners often prioritize aesthetic and visually salient projections over structurally faithful ones, which may compromise analytical reliability.

Method: The authors conducted a user study to assess the existence of a bias towards 'visual interestingness' and to examine its underlying causes.

Result: The study confirmed the existence of a bias, showing that visual aesthetics can influence preferences for projections. This bias is heightened when color-encoded labels are used and with brief exposure times.

Conclusion: Bias in visual interestingness affects the selection of dimensionality reduction projections, and strategies to reduce this bias need to be implemented to ensure analytical reliability.

Abstract: Selecting the dimensionality reduction technique that faithfully represents
the structure is essential for reliable visual communication and analytics. In
reality, however, practitioners favor projections for other attractions, such
as aesthetics and visual saliency, over the projection's structural
faithfulness, a bias we define as visual interestingness. In this research, we
conduct a user study that (1) verifies the existence of such bias and (2)
explains why the bias exists. Our study suggests that visual interestingness
biases practitioners' preferences when selecting projections for analysis, and
this bias intensifies with color-encoded labels and shorter exposure time.
Based on our findings, we discuss strategies to mitigate bias in perceiving and
interpreting DR projections.

### [652] [MIMII-Agent: Leveraging LLMs with Function Calling for Relative Evaluation of Anomalous Sound Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20666)
*Harsh Purohit,Tomoya Nishida,Kota Dohi,Takashi Endo,Yohei Kawaguchi*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using large language models (LLMs) to generate machine-specific anomaly sound data, aiding in the evaluation of unsupervised anomalous sound detection systems without needing real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for generating anomaly sounds rely on manual labels or anomalous training data, which limit scalability and effectiveness when diverse machine types and anomaly patterns are present.

Method: The study uses LLMs to interpret textual descriptions of machine faults and select suitable audio transformations, creating plausible anomalous sounds from normal machine sounds.

Result: Experimental testing on five machine types shows that the relative difficulty in detecting anomalies matches between synthetic and real data, confirming the method's validity.

Conclusion: The LLM-based synthesis approach demonstrates its effectiveness in generating diverse synthetic anomalies and assessing UASD systems, even in the absence of real anomaly sound data.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method for generating machine-type-specific anomalies
to evaluate the relative performance of unsupervised anomalous sound detection
(UASD) systems across different machine types, even in the absence of real
anomaly sound data. Conventional keyword-based data augmentation methods often
produce unrealistic sounds due to their reliance on manually defined labels,
limiting scalability as machine types and anomaly patterns diversify. Advanced
audio generative models, such as MIMII-Gen, show promise but typically depend
on anomalous training data, making them less effective when diverse anomalous
examples are unavailable. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
synthesis approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) to interpret textual
descriptions of faults and automatically select audio transformation functions,
converting normal machine sounds into diverse and plausible anomalous sounds.
We validate this approach by evaluating a UASD system trained only on normal
sounds from five machine types, using both real and synthetic anomaly data.
Experimental results reveal consistent trends in relative detection difficulty
across machine types between synthetic and real anomalies. This finding
supports our hypothesis and highlights the effectiveness of the proposed
LLM-based synthesis approach for relative evaluation of UASD systems.

*Paul Schwerdtner,Prakash Mohan,Julie Bessac,Marc T. Henry de Frahan,Benjamin Peherstorfer*

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: The paper introduces a greedy training procedure for quadratic manifolds that improves prediction accuracy for reduced models, significantly outperforming traditional methods by focusing on both reconstruction and prediction errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy of reduced models in downstream learning tasks by addressing issues caused by non-smooth and oscillatory embeddings.

Method: The proposed method involves a greedy training procedure for quadratic manifolds that simultaneously considers reconstruction error and prediction error during training.

Result: Numerical tests demonstrated that the proposed method produced reduced models with up to two orders of magnitude higher accuracy compared to traditional approaches focused solely on reconstruction error.

Conclusion: The greedy training approach ensures smoother embeddings and significantly improves reduced model accuracy in complex systems like transport and turbulent flow problems.

Abstract: Quadratic manifolds for nonintrusive reduced modeling are typically trained
to minimize the reconstruction error on snapshot data, which means that the
error of models fitted to the embedded data in downstream learning steps is
ignored. In contrast, we propose a greedy training procedure that takes into
account both the reconstruction error on the snapshot data and the prediction
error of reduced models fitted to the data. Because our procedure learns
quadratic manifolds with the objective of achieving accurate reduced models, it
avoids oscillatory and other non-smooth embeddings that can hinder learning
accurate reduced models. Numerical experiments on transport and turbulent flow
problems show that quadratic manifolds trained with the proposed greedy
approach lead to reduced models with up to two orders of magnitude higher
accuracy than quadratic manifolds trained with respect to the reconstruction
error alone.

*Michael Celentano,Chen Cheng,Ashwin Pananjady,Kabir Aladin Verchand*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper develops a framework to analyze iterative algorithms in high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems, detailing state evolution predictions and finite-sample guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend the analytical framework for iterative algorithms in high-dimensional nonconvex settings, where existing methods for state evolution were limited in generality.

Method: The authors provide state evolution predictions for algorithms using interleaved first-order and saddle point updates, utilizing a Hilbert space lifting technique and Bolthausen's conditioning method combined with Gordon's Gaussian comparison inequality.

Result: The paper establishes a state evolution prediction for a broad class of iterative methods, ensures these predictions hold under finite sample conditions, and provides rigorous bounds for deviations.

Conclusion: This work generalizes state evolution analysis to a wider class of iterative algorithms, offering theoretical guarantees and a technical toolkit that may benefit related optimization research.

Abstract: We develop a toolbox for exact analysis of iterative algorithms on a class of
high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems with random data. While prior
work has shown that low-dimensional statistics of (generalized) first-order
methods can be predicted by a deterministic recursion known as state evolution,
our focus is on developing such a prediction for a more general class of
algorithms. We provide a state evolution for any method whose iterations are
given by (possibly interleaved) first-order and saddle point updates, showing
two main results. First, we establish a rigorous state evolution prediction
that holds even when the updates are not coordinate-wise separable. Second, we
establish finite-sample guarantees bounding the deviation of the empirical
updates from the established state evolution. In the process, we develop a
technical toolkit that may prove useful in related problems. One component of
this toolkit is a general Hilbert space lifting technique to prove existence
and uniqueness of a convenient parameterization of the state evolution. Another
component of the toolkit combines a generic application of Bolthausen's
conditioning method with a sequential variant of Gordon's Gaussian comparison
inequality, and provides additional ingredients that enable a general
finite-sample analysis.

### [655] [Extreme value theory for singular subspace estimation in the matrix denoising model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19978)
*Junhyung Chang,Joshua Cape*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper develops fine-grained singular subspace estimation within matrix denoising, revealing asymptotic Gumbel distribution for aligned singular vector differences and proposing a high-power test statistic for low-rank signal structures using the two-to-infinity norm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide improved methods for singular subspace estimation in matrix denoising scenarios, addressing limitations in testing structured low-rank signal alternatives, especially for sparse signals.

Method: The authors utilize a combination of entrywise matrix perturbation, extreme value theory, saddle point approximation methods, and random matrix theory to derive asymptotic properties and propose testing procedures.

Result: The study finds that the aligned differences between leading singular vectors follow a Gumbel distribution under certain conditions. The proposed testing statistic based on the two-to-infinity norm has greater power for detecting sparse or localized signal patterns compared to Frobenius norm-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed asymptotic framework and testing procedure improve hypothesis testing for low-rank structured signal detection, showing robustness to non-Gaussian noise distributions, complementing existing matrix denoising methodologies.

Abstract: This paper studies fine-grained singular subspace estimation in the matrix
denoising model where a deterministic low-rank signal matrix is additively
perturbed by a stochastic matrix of Gaussian noise. We establish that the
maximum Euclidean row norm (i.e., the two-to-infinity norm) of the aligned
difference between the leading sample and population singular vectors
approaches the Gumbel distribution in the large-matrix limit, under suitable
signal-to-noise conditions and after appropriate centering and scaling. We
apply our novel asymptotic distributional theory to test hypotheses of low-rank
signal structure encoded in the leading singular vectors and their
corresponding principal subspace. We provide de-biased estimators for the
corresponding nuisance signal singular values and show that our proposed
plug-in test statistic has desirable properties. Notably, compared to using the
Frobenius norm subspace distance, our test statistic based on the
two-to-infinity norm has higher power to detect structured alternatives that
differ from the null in only a few matrix entries or rows. Our main results are
obtained by a novel synthesis of and technical analysis involving entrywise
matrix perturbation analysis, extreme value theory, saddle point approximation
methods, and random matrix theory. Our contributions complement the existing
literature for matrix denoising focused on minimaxity, mean squared error
analysis, unitarily invariant distances between subspaces, component-wise
asymptotic distributional theory, and row-wise uniform error bounds. Numerical
simulations illustrate our main results and demonstrate the robustness
properties of our testing procedure to non-Gaussian noise distributions.
