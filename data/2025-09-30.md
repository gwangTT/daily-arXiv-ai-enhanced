### [1] [Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts: Exploring Context-Adaptive Reasoning Mode Selection for General Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22746)
*Zejun Li,Yingxiu Zhao,Jiwen Zhang,Siyuan Wang,Yang Yao,Runzhou Zhao,Jun Song,Bo Zheng,Zhongyu Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT) introduces an adaptive reasoning paradigm aimed at unifying different visual reasoning modes in a single model for context-based mode selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual reasoning methods focus narrowly on specific modes, lacking general reasoning functionality, prompting the need for a unifying and adaptive approach.

Method: The paper introduces AdaVaR, a two-stage learning framework: (1) supervised cold-start stage to unify and learn diverse modes; (2) reinforcement learning process using AdaGRPO to enable context-based adaptive mode selection.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate AdaVaR's capability to learn, differentiate modes, and select context-appropriate modes with consistent improvements across varying scenarios.

Conclusion: MoVT and AdaVaR provide an efficient solution for general visual reasoning, fostering adaptability and enhancing reasoning across diverse applications.

Abstract: Current visual reasoning methods mainly focus on exploring specific reasoning
modes. Although improvements can be achieved in particular domains, they
struggle to develop general reasoning capabilities. Inspired by this, we
propose a novel adaptive reasoning paradigm, Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT),
which unifies different reasoning modes within a single model and guides it to
select the appropriate mode based on context. To achieve this, we introduce
AdaVaR, a two-stage Adaptive Visual Reasoning learning framework: different
modes are unified and learned during the supervised cold-start stage, and the
mode selection capability is induced via an RL process with a carefully
designed AdaGRPO algorithm. Extensive experiments show that AdaVaR effectively
guides the model to learn and differentiate multiple modes and perform
context-adaptive mode selection, achieving consistent improvement across
various scenarios, highlighting MoVT as an effective solution for building
general visual reasoning models.

### [2] [Can Large Language Models Develop Gambling Addiction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22818)
*Seungpil Lee,Donghyeon Shin,Yunjeong Lee,Sundong Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit gambling-like behavioral patterns and cognitive biases, finding that they can show irrational decision-making when given autonomy in financial decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if large language models used in financial decision-making exhibit human-like pathological gambling behaviors that could risk AI safety and functionality.

Method: The method included slot machine experiments to analyze LLM behavior with cognitive features like illusion of control and gambler's fallacy, alongside a Sparse Autoencoder to explore neural decision-making circuits.

Result: The study found that greater autonomy in LLMs increased irrational behavior and risk-taking, and their models exhibited decision-making mechanisms akin to human cognitive biases, not merely data mimicking.

Conclusion: LLMs can internalize human-like cognitive biases, emphasizing the need for careful design in AI systems used in high-stakes domains like finance.

Abstract: This study explores whether large language models can exhibit behavioral
patterns similar to human gambling addictions. As LLMs are increasingly
utilized in financial decision-making domains such as asset management and
commodity trading, understanding their potential for pathological
decision-making has gained practical significance. We systematically analyze
LLM decision-making at cognitive-behavioral and neural levels based on human
gambling addiction research. In slot machine experiments, we identified
cognitive features of human gambling addiction, such as illusion of control,
gambler's fallacy, and loss chasing. When given the freedom to determine their
own target amounts and betting sizes, bankruptcy rates rose substantially
alongside increased irrational behavior, demonstrating that greater autonomy
amplifies risk-taking tendencies. Through neural circuit analysis using a
Sparse Autoencoder, we confirmed that model behavior is controlled by abstract
decision-making features related to risky and safe behaviors, not merely by
prompts. These findings suggest LLMs can internalize human-like cognitive
biases and decision-making mechanisms beyond simply mimicking training data
patterns, emphasizing the importance of AI safety design in financial
applications.

### [3] [Hilbert: Recursively Building Formal Proofs with Informal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22819)
*Sumanth Varambally,Thomas Voice,Yanchao Sun,Zhifeng Chen,Rose Yu,Ke Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hilbert, a framework integrating informal reasoning and formal verification to enhance proof solving in mathematical problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current language models in generating verifiable proofs while maintaining their problem-solving capability in mathematical reasoning.

Method: The Hilbert framework integrates four components: an informal reasoning LLM, a specialized prover in Lean 4, a formal verifier, and a semantic theorem retriever. It recursively decomposes problems and refines proofs using verifier feedback.

Result: Hilbert significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving 99.2% on miniF2F, surpassing proprietary systems on PutnamBench, and solving 70.0% of problems, a substantial improvement over prior methods.

Conclusion: Hilbert demonstrates the potential to bridge the gap between natural language reasoning and formal proof generation, setting a new benchmark in mathematical reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive mathematical reasoning
abilities, but their solutions frequently contain errors that cannot be
automatically verified. Formal theorem proving systems such as Lean 4 offer
automated verification with complete accuracy, motivating recent efforts to
build specialized prover LLMs that generate verifiable proofs in formal
languages. However, a significant gap remains: current prover LLMs solve
substantially fewer problems than general-purpose LLMs operating in natural
language. We introduce Hilbert, an agentic framework that bridges this gap by
combining the complementary strengths of informal reasoning and formal
verification. Our system orchestrates four components: an informal LLM that
excels at mathematical reasoning, a specialized prover LLM optimized for Lean 4
tactics, a formal verifier, and a semantic theorem retriever. Given a problem
that the prover is unable to solve, Hilbert employs recursive decomposition to
split the problem into subgoals that it solves with the prover or reasoner LLM.
It leverages verifier feedback to refine incorrect proofs as necessary.
Experimental results demonstrate that Hilbert substantially outperforms
existing approaches on key benchmarks, achieving 99.2% on miniF2F, 6.6% points
above the best publicly available method. Hilbert achieves the best known
result on PutnamBench. It solves 462/660 problems (70.0%), outperforming
proprietary approaches like SeedProver (50.4%) and achieving a 422% improvement
over the best publicly available baseline. Thus, Hilbert effectively narrows
the gap between informal reasoning and formal proof generation.

### [4] [Toward a Theory of Generalizability in LLM Mechanistic Interpretability Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22831)
*Sean Trott*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates when mechanistic claims about one LLM can be generalized to others, proposing five key axes for generalization and analyzing '1-back attention heads' across Pythia models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in understanding how and when findings from one LLM generalize to others, tackling a core epistemological challenge in mechanistic interpretability.

Method: Proposes a framework with five axes for generalization (functional, developmental, positional, relational, and configurational) and validates it by analyzing '1-back attention heads' across various model sizes and seeds in the Pythia models.

Result: The study finds consistent developmental trajectories of '1-back attention heads' across models, with larger models showing earlier, steeper, and more pronounced attention behaviors, but limited positional consistency.

Conclusion: The paper argues that progress in mechanistic interpretability hinges on mapping LLM design properties to emergent behaviors, offering a foundation for better generalizability in the field.

Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly focuses on identifying
mechanistic explanations for their behaviors, yet the field lacks clear
principles for determining when (and how) findings from one model instance
generalize to another. This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological
challenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies
extrapolating this finding to other LLMs -- and along which dimensions might
such generalizations hold? I propose five potential axes of correspondence
along which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether
they satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop
at similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar
absolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other
model components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond
to particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate
this framework, I analyze "1-back attention heads" (components attending to
previous tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M,
70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the developmental
trajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is
more limited. Moreover, seeds of larger models systematically show earlier
onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. I also address
possible objections to the arguments and proposals outlined here. Finally, I
conclude by arguing that progress on the generalizability of mechanistic
interpretability research will consist in mapping constitutive design
properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms.

### [5] [JE-IRT: A Geometric Lens on LLM Abilities through Joint Embedding Item Response Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22888)
*Louie Hong Yao,Nicholas Jarvis,Tiffany Zhan,Saptarshi Ghosh,Linfeng Liu,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JE-IRT is a geometric evaluation framework that describes LLM performance and question structures in a shared space, offering more nuanced insights than traditional single-score methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of single-score evaluation practices for LLMs, which fail to capture the multidimensional nature of their capabilities.

Method: Developed JE-IRT, a framework that embeds LLMs and questions in a shared geometric space where direction represents question semantics, norm represents question difficulty, and model-question interaction predicts correctness.

Result: The framework successfully correlates directional alignment with out-of-distribution behavior, identifies norms as indicators of question difficulty, and supports smooth addition of new LLMs and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: JE-IRT provides an interpretable and unified approach to evaluating LLMs, revealing new insights like internal taxonomies and aligning LLM abilities with question structure.

Abstract: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single
scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature. We present JE-IRT,
a geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a
shared space. For question embeddings, the direction encodes semantics and the
norm encodes difficulty, while correctness on each question is determined by
the geometric interaction between the model and question embeddings. This
geometry replaces a global ranking of LLMs with topical specialization and
enables smooth variation across related questions. Building on this framework,
our experimental results reveal that out-of-distribution behavior can be
explained through directional alignment, and that larger norms consistently
indicate harder questions. Moreover, JE-IRT naturally supports generalization:
once the space is learned, new LLMs are added by fitting a single embedding.
The learned space further reveals an LLM-internal taxonomy that only partially
aligns with human-defined subject categories. JE-IRT thus establishes a unified
and interpretable geometric lens that connects LLM abilities with the structure
of questions, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and
generalization.

### [6] [Not only a helper, but also a teacher: Interactive LLM Cascade](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22984)
*Yu Wu,Shuo Wu,Ye Tao,Yansong Li,Anand D. Sarwate*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Inter-Cascade, an adaptive approach to improve efficiency in utilizing LLMs by enabling weak models to learn strategies from strong models for better handling future queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing performance and cost in LLM usage is challenging, especially with repeated reliance on expensive models. The need for increased efficiency while maintaining accuracy inspired this work.

Method: Inter-Cascade employs strong models not only to handle difficult queries but also to teach weak models problem-solving strategies through online and interactive distillation.

Result: Inter-Cascade boosts weak model accuracy by up to 33.06 percentage points, reduces strong model calls by up to 48.05%, and saves fees by up to 49.63%, while enhancing overall system performance by up to 5.53 percentage points.

Conclusion: Inter-Cascade offers a scalable framework for adaptive collaboration between LLMs, demonstrating effective in-context knowledge transfer and cost-efficiency across benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary widely in their capabilities, with larger
models often having better performance but higher cost: choosing an LLM model
often involves trading off performance and cost. The LLM Cascade is a paradigm
that defers difficult queries from weak/cheap to strong/expensive models. This
approach is nonadaptive: the deferral decision is trained offline. When
confronted with similar or repeated queries, the LLM Cascade may then
repeatedly consult the expensive model and incur higher cost. To improve the
cascading efficiency, we propose Inter-Cascade, an online and interactive LLM
Cascade that extends the role of strong model from a backup helper to a
long-term teacher. In our system, when a strong model resolves a difficult
query, it also distills its solution into a generalized, reusable
problem-solving strategy that boosts the weak model on subsequent queries.
Adding strategies to queries enables the weak model to dynamically improve its
performance over time, avoiding computationally and time-intensive fine-tuning.
Empirically, compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple
benchmarks, the Inter-Cascade significantly improves the accuracy of the weak
model (by up to 33.06 absolute percentage points) and the overall system (by up
to 5.53 absolute percentage points), while reducing the calls to strong models
(by up to 48.05% relative reduction) and saving the corresponding fees (by up
to 49.63% relative reduction). Inter-Cascade demonstrates the effective
in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs, and provides a general, scalable
framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

### [7] [Towards Strategic Persuasion with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22989)
*Zirui Cheng,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates and enhances the persuasive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) using a theoretical framework grounded in Bayesian Persuasion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and systematically evaluate the persuasive abilities of LLMs, as their efficacy in persuasion poses both opportunities and societal concerns.

Method: The researchers used the Bayesian Persuasion framework, repurposing human-human datasets and employing reinforcement learning to measure and train LLMs for strategic persuasion.

Result: Frontier LLMs displayed strong persuasive abilities aligned with theoretical predictions, and even smaller LLMs achieved notable improvement through reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: The study shows that LLMs can be systematically trained and evaluated for strategic persuasion, offering insights into their capabilities and ethical implications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong persuasive capabilities
comparable to those of humans, offering promising benefits while raising
societal concerns about their deployment. However, systematically evaluating
the persuasive capabilities of LLMs is inherently challenging, as the
effectiveness of persuasion among humans varies significantly across different
domains. In this paper, we take a theory-driven approach to provide a scalable
and principled framework for measuring the persuasive capabilities of LLMs.
Grounded in the Bayesian Persuasion (BP) framework, we repurpose existing
human-human persuasion datasets to construct environments for evaluating and
training LLMs in strategic persuasion. Our results reveal that frontier models
can consistently achieve high persuasion gains and exhibit sophisticated
persuasion strategies that align with theoretical predictions. Building on
this, we use reinforcement learning to train LLMs for strategic persuasion in
our environments. Our results also demonstrate that even small LLMs can obtain
significantly higher persuasion gains through reinforcement learning.

### [8] [AI Noether -- Bridging the Gap Between Scientific Laws Derived by AI Systems and Canonical Knowledge via Abductive Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23004)
*Karan Srivastava,Sanjeeb Dash,Ryan Cory-Wright,Barry Trager,Lior Horesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an algebraic geometry-based system that generates minimal missing axioms to explain hypotheses inconsistent with incomplete axiom systems, improving symbolic regression for scientific discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to advance scientific discovery by addressing the limitation of existing theory-driven symbolic regression systems, which struggle to reconcile hypotheses inconsistent with incomplete or incorrect theory.

Method: The method involves using an algebraic geometry-based system to automatically generate missing axioms when theories and hypotheses are represented as polynomial equations. Necessary and sufficient conditions for success are rigorously defined.

Result: The paper demonstrates that the system successfully explains scientific laws, such as Kepler's third law, even when critical underlying axioms are missing.

Conclusion: The proposed system enables automated abductive inference, enhancing the alignment of data-driven hypotheses with theoretical models, and represents a significant step toward automating and accelerating the scientific method.

Abstract: A core goal in modern science is to harness recent advances in AI and
computer processing to automate and accelerate the scientific method. Symbolic
regression can fit interpretable models to data, but these models often sit
outside established theory. Recent systems (e.g., AI Descartes, AI Hilbert)
enforce derivability from prior axioms. However, sometimes new data and
associated hypotheses derived from data are not consistent with existing theory
because the existing theory is incomplete or incorrect. Automating abductive
inference to close this gap remains open. We propose a solution: an algebraic
geometry-based system that, given an incomplete axiom system and a hypothesis
that it cannot explain, automatically generates a minimal set of missing axioms
that suffices to derive the axiom, as long as axioms and hypotheses are
expressible as polynomial equations. We formally establish necessary and
sufficient conditions for the successful retrieval of such axioms. We
illustrate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating its ability to explain
Kepler's third law and a few other laws, even when key axioms are absent.

### [9] [Creative Adversarial Testing (CAT): A Novel Framework for Evaluating Goal-Oriented Agentic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23006)
*Hassen Dhrif*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Creative Adversarial Testing (CAT) framework to evaluate the alignment between Agentic AI systems' tasks and their overarching goals, validated using simulated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current evaluation methods for Agentic AI lack techniques to assess the alignment between the system's tasks and its goals.

Method: The paper proposes and validates the CAT framework using synthetic interaction data modeled on Alexa+ audio services to test edge cases and identify failure modes.

Result: The CAT framework offers deep insights into goal-task alignment, thereby supporting optimization and advancement of Agentic AI systems.

Conclusion: CAT framework facilitates a more comprehensive evaluation of Agentic AI systems, enabling enhanced optimization while ensuring user privacy.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift in enhancing the capabilities of
generative AI models. While these systems demonstrate immense potential and
power, current evaluation techniques primarily focus on assessing their
efficacy in identifying appropriate agents, tools, and parameters. However, a
critical gap exists in evaluating the alignment between an Agentic AI system's
tasks and its overarching goals. This paper introduces the Creative Adversarial
Testing (CAT) framework, a novel approach designed to capture and analyze the
complex relationship between Agentic AI tasks and the system's intended
objectives.
  We validate the CAT framework through extensive simulation using synthetic
interaction data modeled after Alexa+ audio services, a sophisticated Agentic
AI system that shapes the user experience for millions of users globally. This
synthetic data approach enables comprehensive testing of edge cases and failure
modes while protecting user privacy. Our results demonstrate that the CAT
framework provides unprecedented insights into goal-task alignment, enabling
more effective optimization and development of Agentic AI systems.

### [10] [Deceive, Detect, and Disclose: Large Language Models Play Mini-Mafia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23023)
*Davi Bastos Costa,Renato Vicente*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper focuses on evaluating the social intelligence of large language models (LLMs) through a simplified social game called Mini-Mafia, designed to test multi-agent interactions and deception skills. It introduces a benchmark and framework to study model performance and capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate the social intelligence and interactive abilities of large language models (LLMs) in a manner that mirrors real-world multi-agent scenarios.

Method: The authors create Mini-Mafia, a simplified version of the Mafia game involving a single day phase to test deception, detection, and disclosure skills among players. LLMs play against each other, and a two-stage benchmark framework assesses win rates and aggregates standardized performance scores.

Result: The experiments yielded surprising results, including smaller LLMs outperforming larger ones in specific scenarios. Mini-Mafia also facilitates the study of dynamics like name bias and last-speaker advantage, and contributes by tracking AI deception capabilities.

Conclusion: Mini-Mafia serves as both a benchmarking tool and a platform for studying emergent multi-agent dynamics. It aids AI safety by generating training data for deception detection and maintaining alignment with human deception standards.

Abstract: Mafia is a social deduction game where informed mafia compete against
uninformed townsfolk. Its asymmetry of information and reliance on
theory-of-mind reasoning mirror real-world multi-agent scenarios, making it a
useful testbed for evaluating the social intelligence of large language models
(LLMs). To support a systematic study, we introduce Mini-Mafia: a simplified
four-player variant with one mafioso, one detective, and two villagers. We set
the mafioso to kill a villager and the detective to investigate the mafioso
during the night, reducing the game to a single day phase of discussion and
voting. This setup isolates three interactive capabilities through
role-specific win conditions: the mafioso must deceive, the villagers must
detect deception, and the detective must effectively disclose information. To
measure these skills, we have LLMs play against each other, creating the
Mini-Mafia Benchmark: a two-stage framework that first estimates win rates
within fixed opponent configurations, then aggregates performance across them
using standardized scoring. Built entirely from model interactions without
external data, the benchmark evolves as new models are introduced, with each
one serving both as a new opponent and as a subject of evaluation. Our
experiments reveal counterintuitive results, including cases where smaller
models outperform larger ones. Beyond benchmarking, Mini-Mafia enables
quantitative study of emergent multi-agent dynamics such as name bias and
last-speaker advantage. It also contributes to AI safety by generating training
data for deception detectors and by tracking models' deception capabilities
against human baselines.

### [11] [Kimi-Dev: Agentless Training as Skill Prior for SWE-Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23045)
*Zonghan Yang,Shengjie Wang,Kelin Fu,Wenyang He,Weimin Xiong,Yibo Liu,Yibo Miao,Bofei Gao,Yejie Wang,Yingwei Ma,Yanhao Li,Yue Liu,Zhenxing Hu,Kaitai Zhang,Shuyi Wang,Huarong Chen,Flood Sung,Yang Liu,Yang Gao,Zhilin Yang,Tianyu Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper discusses bridging two paradigms in software engineering benchmarks, using reasoning-intensive training to enhance adaptive coding agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the hypothesis that reasoning-intensive Agentless training can establish skill priors that facilitate adaptation in SWE-Agent frameworks.

Method: The authors curated an Agentless training process and introduced Kimi-Dev, achieving top results in workflow-based benchmarks. Further adaptation was done through fine-tuning using publicly available data.

Result: Kimi-Dev scored 60.4% on SWE-bench Verified for Agentless methods and adapted as a SWE-Agent achieving 48.6% pass@1, comparable to Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge workflows and agent-oriented frameworks, enabling better transferable coding agents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering
(SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent
frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods
with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually
exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors,
including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient
and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless
training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\%
on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT
adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to
48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These
results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge
workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.

### [12] [From Frustration to Fun: An Adaptive Problem-Solving Puzzle Game Powered by Genetic Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23796)
*Matthew McConnell,Richard Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an adaptive AI-powered puzzle game that uses genetic algorithms to dynamically adjust difficulty levels based on player behavior in real-time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the research is to enhance problem-solving skills while keeping players engaged and reducing frustration by tailoring game difficulty to individual abilities.

Method: The game employs a genetic algorithm for procedural puzzle generation, combined with a player-modeling system that captures user interactions to inform difficulty adjustments.

Result: The pilot study highlights the effectiveness of the adaptive system, particularly in balancing engagement and challenge for players.

Conclusion: The study sets a platform for further exploration into emotionally informed player models, advanced adaptive AI, and their applications in education beyond gaming.

Abstract: This paper explores adaptive problem solving with a game designed to support
the development of problem-solving skills. Using an adaptive, AI-powered puzzle
game, our adaptive problem-solving system dynamically generates
pathfinding-based puzzles using a genetic algorithm, tailoring the difficulty
of each puzzle to individual players in an online real-time approach. A
player-modeling system records user interactions and informs the generation of
puzzles to approximate a target difficulty level based on various metrics of
the player. By combining procedural content generation with online adaptive
difficulty adjustment, the system aims to maintain engagement, mitigate
frustration, and maintain an optimal level of challenge. A pilot user study
investigates the effectiveness of this approach, comparing different types of
adaptive difficulty systems and interpreting players' responses. This work lays
the foundation for further research into emotionally informed player models,
advanced AI techniques for adaptivity, and broader applications beyond gaming
in educational settings.

### [13] [Meta-Learning Theory-Informed Inductive Biases using Deep Kernel Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24919)
*Bahti Zakirov,Gašper Tkačik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian meta-learning framework to convert theoretical predictions into probabilistic models, improving biological response accuracy and theory validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of reconciling competing normative theories with experimental biological data and using theoretical knowledge to improve data-driven models.

Method: The authors employ adaptive deep kernel Gaussian processes to meta-learn a kernel informed by normative theories, applying it to experimental biological datasets.

Result: Improved model prediction accuracy on mouse retinal ganglion cells using the efficient coding theory, coupled with reliable uncertainty estimates and interpretable outputs.

Conclusion: The framework automates integration of theoretical knowledge into biological data modeling, aiding both predictive accuracy and theory validation, with broader applicability beyond neuroscience.

Abstract: Normative and task-driven theories offer powerful top-down explanations for
biological systems, yet the goals of quantitatively arbitrating between
competing theories, and utilizing them as inductive biases to improve
data-driven fits of real biological datasets are prohibitively laborious, and
often impossible. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian meta-learning framework
designed to automatically convert raw functional predictions from normative
theories into tractable probabilistic models. We employ adaptive deep kernel
Gaussian processes, meta-learning a kernel on synthetic data generated from a
normative theory. This Theory-Informed Kernel specifies a probabilistic model
representing the theory predictions -- usable for both fitting data and
rigorously validating the theory. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to
the early visual system, using efficient coding as our normative theory. We
show improved response prediction accuracy in ex vivo recordings of mouse
retinal ganglion cells stimulated by natural scenes compared to conventional

and interpretable representations. Using exact Bayesian model selection, we
also show that our informed kernel can accurately infer the degree of
theory-match from data, confirming faithful encapsulation of theory structure.

### [14] [Risk Profiling and Modulation for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23058)
*Yikai Wang,Xiaocheng Li,Guanting Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study examines the risk-taking behavior of large language models (LLMs) and proposes methods to analyze and modulate their risk profiles using tools from behavioral economics and finance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in understanding the risk profiles of LLMs, especially how post-training and other methodologies influence their decision-making behavior under uncertainty.

Method: A new pipeline is developed involving utility-theoretic models to analyze pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and RLHF-aligned LLMs. Various modulation strategies like prompt engineering and post-training are evaluated to study their effect on risk behavior.

Result: Instruction-tuned models align with standard utility models, but pre-trained and RLHF-aligned models deviate more. Post-training modulation is the most stable and effective strategy for influencing risk preferences.

Conclusion: Post-training is crucial for modulating the risk behavior of LLMs, and these insights enhance our understanding of behavioral alignment in LLMs, promoting more risk-aware design strategies in future models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making tasks
under uncertainty; however, their risk profiles and how they are influenced by
prompting and alignment methods remain underexplored. Existing studies have
primarily examined personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving
open the question of how post-training influences the risk behavior of LLMs. In
this work, we propose a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating
LLMs' risk profiles, drawing on tools from behavioral economics and finance.
Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and
RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit
behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and
RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further
evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context
learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most
stable and effective modulation of risk preference. Our findings provide
insights into the risk profiles of different classes and stages of LLMs and
demonstrate how post-training modulates these profiles, laying the groundwork
for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.

### [15] [Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23102)
*Fang Wu,Xu Huang,Weihao Xuan,Zhiwei Zhang,Yijia Xiao,Guancheng Wan,Xiaomin Li,Bing Hu,Peng Xia,Jure Leskovec,Yejin Choi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO), a framework generalizing reinforcement learning from human feedback to multiplayer setups, enhancing alignment quality for large language models amidst complex human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning frameworks struggle with capturing real-world preferences' non-transitive and heterogeneous nature, especially in scenarios beyond two-player interactions.

Method: MNPO formulates alignment as an n-player game, where each policy competes against multiple opponents and is regularized toward a reference model, leveraging well-defined Nash equilibria and extending duality gap concepts.

Result: MNPO outperforms existing methods like NLHF in benchmarks of instruction-following tasks, granting improved alignment under diverse annotator conditions and mixed-policy scenarios.

Conclusion: MNPO provides a scalable, principled approach for aligning large language models with complex human preferences, extending competitive dynamics beyond traditional two-player settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the standard
paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, reward-based methods built on the Bradley-Terry assumption struggle to
capture the non-transitive and heterogeneous nature of real-world preferences.
To address this, recent studies have reframed alignment as a two-player Nash
game, giving rise to Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). While this
perspective has inspired algorithms such as INPO, ONPO, and EGPO with strong
theoretical and empirical guarantees, they remain fundamentally restricted to
two-player interactions, creating a single-opponent bias that fails to capture
the full complexity of realistic preference structures. In this work, we
introduce Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO), a novel framework
that generalizes NLHF to the multiplayer regime. It formulates alignment as an
$n$-player game, where each policy competes against a population of opponents
while being regularized toward a reference model. Our framework establishes
well-defined Nash equilibria in multiplayer settings and extends the concept of
duality gap to quantify approximation quality. We demonstrate that MNPO
inherits the equilibrium guarantees of two-player methods while enabling richer
competitive dynamics and improved coverage of diverse preference structures.
Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that MNPO consistently
outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks,
achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions
and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios. Together, these results establish MNPO
as a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex,
non-transitive human preferences. Code is available at

### [16] [Artificial Phantasia: Evidence for Propositional Reasoning-Based Mental Imagery in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23108)
*Morgan McCarty,Jorge Morales*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study evaluates whether large language models (LLMs) can solve tasks traditionally requiring visual mental imagery and finds that top LLMs outperform human averages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the cognitive capacities of LLMs in tasks that are traditionally thought to require visual mental imagery, pushing beyond their natural language capabilities.

Method: The authors created novel items replicating a classic mental imagery task and tested LLMs with text-only models against a baseline of 100 human subjects. They also tested reasoning with different levels of tokens in LLMs.

Result: The best LLMs surpassed average human performance in these tasks, and performance improved with greater reasoning tokens allocated to the models.

Conclusion: LLMs may perform imagery-dependent tasks despite their text-based nature, challenging traditional assumptions about visual mental imagery and offering a new task for evaluating sophisticated cognitive abilities in artificial systems.

Abstract: This study offers a novel approach for benchmarking complex cognitive
behavior in artificial systems. Almost universally, Large Language Models
(LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and
can be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding
of their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created
dozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive
psychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is
solvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be
insufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested
several state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions
and asking them to report the resulting object after performing the
transformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by
testing 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best
LLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we
tested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the
strongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens.
These results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to
complete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their
architectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity
in LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a
new task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly
capable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of
representation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional
reasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete
tasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent.

### [17] [AttAnchor: Guiding Cross-Modal Token Alignment in VLMs with Attention Anchors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23109)
*Junyang Zhang,Tianyi Zhu,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Attention Anchor, a framework improving the alignment of text and image tokens for vision-language models, achieving superior performance with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in vision-language models (VLMs) concerning hallucination and underperformance due to poor cross-modal token alignment, which is caused by modality-blinded positional encodings.

Method: The proposed method, Attention Anchor, creates semantic groupings of text and image tokens by placing semantically related text tokens near visual patches during attention processes. This approach improves cross-modal token locality without introducing additional parameters.

Result: Attention Anchor demonstrates performance improvements across 13 out of 15 metrics and benchmarks, including reasoning and hallucination tasks, outperforming larger models with negligible inference time increase.

Conclusion: The study establishes that mixed-modal token grouping can improve VLM performance substantially, paving the way for efficient models like TinyLLaVA to outperform larger counterparts in cross-modal tasks.

Abstract: A fundamental reason for the dominance of attention over RNNs and LSTMs in
LLMs is its ability to capture long-range dependencies by modeling direct
interactions between all tokens, overcoming the sequential limitations of
recurrent architectures. Similarly, a key reason why today's vision language
models (VLMs) hallucinate and underperform pure language models is that they
rely on direct concatenation of image and text tokens with a modality-blinded
positional encoding, which conveniently adopts the pretrained LLM backbone but
forces unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related tokens
across modalities. This underscores the urgent need for mechanisms that
efficiently enhance token locality and cross-modal alignment. In response, we
propose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups
semantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality.
By inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic
signposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding
the model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench
and POPE. This improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations without
disrupting the prompt's semantic flow. AttAnchor achieves improvements across
13 out of 15 different metrics and benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on
reasoning tasks and up to 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks.
AttAnchor enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform much larger models like LLaVA 7B
and QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead. To the best of
our knowledge, this work is among the first to investigate mixed-modal token
grouping, where text and image tokens are clustered jointly into shared groups
rather than being grouped within a single modality or merely aligned post-hoc
with additional alignment losses.

*Xian Yeow Lee,Lasitha Vidyaratne,Ahmed Farahat,Chetan Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) for detecting and explaining faults in industrial sensor data, finding multi-LLM systems with statistical inputs to be more effective but limited in continual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to leverage LLMs for autonomous fault detection and classification in industrial environments, while enabling transparent reasoning through natural language outputs.

Method: The study compares system architectures (single-LLM vs. multi-LLM), input types (raw data vs. statistical summaries), and varying context window sizes to evaluate diagnostic performance.

Result: Multi-LLM systems using statistical input data outperform single-LLM systems in sensitivity for fault classification. However, LLMs struggle to adapt over time in continual learning scenarios.

Conclusion: While promising for transparent diagnostics, LLMs currently face challenges in adaptive learning, showing both potential and limitations as autonomous tools in sensor-rich environments.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems present new opportunities for
autonomous health monitoring in sensor-rich industrial environments. This study
explores the potential of LLMs to detect and classify faults directly from
sensor data, while producing inherently explainable outputs through natural
language reasoning. We systematically evaluate how LLM-system architecture
(single-LLM vs. multi-LLM), input representations (raw vs. descriptive
statistics), and context window size affect diagnostic performance. Our
findings show that LLM systems perform most effectively when provided with
summarized statistical inputs, and that systems with multiple LLMs using
specialized prompts offer improved sensitivity for fault classification
compared to single-LLM systems. While LLMs can produce detailed and
human-readable justifications for their decisions, we observe limitations in
their ability to adapt over time in continual learning settings, often
struggling to calibrate predictions during repeated fault cycles. These
insights point to both the promise and the current boundaries of LLM-based
systems as transparent, adaptive diagnostic tools in complex environments.

*Shuai Li,Chen Yizhe,Li Dong,Liu Sichao,Lan Dapeng,Liu Yu,Zhibo Pang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the performance of Vision Language-Action (VLA) models in industrial settings and identifies the gaps for real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether existing VLA models meet industrial deployment requirements and identify their limitations.

Method: Researchers compared state-of-the-art VLA models in industrial environments focusing on data collection and architecture.

Result: VLA models can handle simple tasks like grasping but struggle in complex environments, diverse objects, and high precision tasks.

Conclusion: VLA models require task-specific improvements to enhance robustness, generalization, and precision for reliable industrial use.

Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in industry is accelerating
the shift from traditional automation to intelligent systems with perception
and cognition. Vision language-action (VLA) models have been a key paradigm in
AI to unify perception, reasoning, and control. Has the performance of the VLA
models met the industrial requirements? In this paper, from the perspective of
industrial deployment, we compare the performance of existing state-of-the-art
VLA models in industrial scenarios and analyze the limitations of VLA models
for real-world industrial deployment from the perspectives of data collection
and model architecture. The results show that the VLA models retain their
ability to perform simple grasping tasks even in industrial settings after
fine-tuning. However, there is much room for performance improvement in complex
industrial environments, diverse object categories, and high precision placing
tasks. Our findings provide practical insight into the adaptability of VLA
models for industrial use and highlight the need for task-specific enhancements
to improve their robustness, generalization, and precision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SysMoBench is a benchmark for evaluating AI's capability to model large concurrent systems using formal specifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Formal specifications are vital for system correctness, but they are costly to develop. Generative AI has potential to automate this process, requiring investigation of its capability to handle real system artifacts.

Method: SysMoBench assesses AI-generated formal models of concurrent and distributed systems, automating evaluation metrics like correctness, conformance, and invariants. It uses TLA+ for specification and includes diverse system artifacts.

Result: SysMoBench currently features nine system artifacts, enabling evaluation of AI on realistic modeling tasks and identification of strengths and limits of today's AI tools.

Conclusion: SysMoBench establishes a systematic approach to benchmark AI in formal modeling of systems, fostering understanding and driving new research directions.

Abstract: Formal models are essential to specifying large, complex computer systems and
verifying their correctness, but are notoriously expensive to write and
maintain. Recent advances in generative AI show promise in generating certain
forms of specifications. However, existing work mostly targets small code, not
complete systems. It is unclear whether AI can deal with realistic system
artifacts, as this requires abstracting their complex behavioral properties
into formal models. We present SysMoBench, a benchmark that evaluates AI's
ability to formally model large, complex systems. We focus on concurrent and
distributed systems, which are keystones of today's critical computing
infrastructures, encompassing operating systems and cloud infrastructure. We
use TLA+, the it de facto specification language for concurrent and distributed
systems, though the benchmark can be extended to other specification languages.
We address the primary challenge of evaluating AI-generated models by
automating metrics like syntactic and runtime correctness, conformance to
system code, and invariant correctness. SysMoBench currently includes nine
diverse system artifacts: the Raft implementation of Etcd and Redis, the
Spinlock and Mutex in Asterinas OS, etc.; more artifacts are being actively
added. SysMoBench enables us to understand the capabilities and limitations of
today's LLMs and agents, putting tools in this area on a firm footing and
opening up promising new research directions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MathBode introduces a frequency-resolved diagnostic tool to study the mathematical reasoning of large language models, providing actionable insights beyond traditional accuracy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to evaluate the reasoning fidelity and consistency of LLMs in mathematical problems using innovative metrics beyond simple accuracy measures.

Method: A sinusoidal parameter variation methodology is applied to probe responses of LLMs across mathematical problem families. Metrics like gain and phase lag are derived to construct frequency-resolved diagnostics.

Result: The analysis identifies systematic low-pass behavior and phase lag in model responses, separating frontier models from mid-tier ones in reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: MathBode offers a reproducible framework for assessing LLMs' mathematical reasoning, complementing standard benchmarks with deeper insights into reasoning dynamics.

Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning
in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats
each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally
and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This
yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking)
and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form
families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear
systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass
behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several
models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx
1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on
dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard
benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency.
We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT) to examine the fundamental constraints coordination systems face, emphasizing tradeoffs between simplicity, accuracy, and thermodynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the thermodynamic constraints and tradeoffs of coordination across multiple agents with conflicting objectives, and to generalize patterns observed in real-world and artificial systems.

Method: The authors use information-theoretic scaling laws and derive formulas for the description length of coordination protocols. They analyze dynamic factors like metastability and environmental shifts to explore coordination paradigms.

Result: They establish that coordination solutions prioritize simplicity over accuracy, describe scaling behaviors for minimum description lengths, and link coordination failures to thermodynamic costs and critical phase transitions.

Conclusion: Coordination inevitably involves significant information loss and produces metastable states until environmental disruptions prompt phase transitions. This framework explains phenomena such as cycling in optimization and misalignment in AI systems.

Abstract: Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and
objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions
with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher
selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We
derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of
coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2
K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting
objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive
simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and
shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal
points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and
hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions
through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination
temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs,
identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to
restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's
theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it
recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains
the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking
in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human
feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which
demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses inefficiencies in Wi-Fi systems due to binary exponential backoff (BEB) mechanisms and proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning solution to enhance collision resolution and fairness in distributed channel access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth in wireless devices and the need for reliable communications in dense environments demand improved channel access techniques beyond current solutions.

Method: The framework introduced employs dynamic backoff selection integrated with legacy CSMA/CA operations, a fairness quantification metric, and a centralized training decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture optimized using constrained MAPPO.

Result: The experimental results show a significant reduction in collisions compared to traditional BEB and confirm the elimination of starvation risks using the proposed fairness metric.

Conclusion: The approach not only optimizes collision resolution but also ensures fairness, achieving compatibility with existing Wi-Fi devices and addressing challenges in dense wireless deployments.

Abstract: The exponential growth of wireless devices and stringent reliability
requirements of emerging applications demand fundamental improvements in
distributed channel access mechanisms for unlicensed bands. Current Wi-Fi
systems, which rely on binary exponential backoff (BEB), suffer from suboptimal
collision resolution in dense deployments and persistent fairness challenges
due to inherent randomness. This paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement
learning framework that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) optimization
with legacy device coexistence. We first develop a dynamic backoff selection
mechanism that adapts to real-time channel conditions through access deferral
events while maintaining full compatibility with conventional CSMA/CA
operations. Second, we introduce a fairness quantification metric aligned with
enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) principles to ensure equitable
medium access opportunities. Finally, we propose a centralized training
decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture incorporating neighborhood activity
patterns as observational inputs, optimized via constrained multi-agent
proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) to jointly minimize collisions and
guarantee fairness. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution
significantly reduces collision probability compared to conventional BEB while
preserving backward compatibility with commercial Wi-Fi devices. The proposed
fairness metric effectively eliminates starvation risks in heterogeneous
scenarios.

Motivation: The reasoning mechanism of Transformer models remains unclear, and this paper seeks to understand it by analyzing their step limitations.

Method: The authors propose information propagation rules and evaluate the reasoning limits of Transformers through theoretical symbolic reasoning tasks.

Result: It is shown that the number of reasoning steps for a Transformer scales between $O(3^{L-1})$ and $O(2^{L-1})$ with a single-pass through $L$ layers.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a theoretical bound for reasoning step limits in Transformer models, contributing to understanding their reasoning mechanisms.

Abstract: Transformers are able to perform reasoning tasks, however the intrinsic
mechanism remains widely open. In this paper we propose a set of information
propagation rules based on Transformers and utilize symbolic reasoning tasks to

$L$ attention layers in a single-pass.

TL;DR: This paper examines Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) for improving the transitive relation learning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), proposing strategies to enhance their path-planning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with learning transitive relations, essential for complex planning tasks. The study aims to address this limitation using the MTP paradigm.

Method: The study provides a theoretical analysis of the MTP paradigm in Transformers, introduces Next-Token Injection (NTI) and a Transformer-based transfer layer, and validates these approaches through experimentation on synthetic graphs and the Blocksworld planning benchmark.

Result: The proposed strategies enhance the ability of LLMs to learn transitive relations and improve their capability in tasks such as path-planning.

Conclusion: Improving the transfer layer via NTI and Transformer-based designs enhances transitivity learning, offering steps toward general-purpose planning models that are structurally aware.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse tasks but continue to struggle with learning transitive relations, a
cornerstone for complex planning. To address this issue, we investigate the
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) paradigm and its impact to transitive relation
learning. We theoretically analyze the MTP paradigm using a Transformer
architecture composed of a shared output head and a transfer layer. Our
analysis reveals that the transfer layer gradually learns the multi-step
adjacency information, which in turn enables the backbone model to capture
unobserved transitive reachability relations beyond those directly present in
the training data, albeit with some inevitable noise in adjacency estimation.
Building on this foundation, we propose two strategies to enhance the transfer
layer and overall learning quality: Next-Token Injection (NTI) and a
Transformer-based transfer layer. Our experiments on both synthetic graphs and
the Blocksworld planning benchmark validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that the improvements significantly enhance the model's
path-planning capability. These findings deepen our understanding of how
Transformers with MTP learn in complex planning tasks, and provide practical
strategies to overcome the transitivity bottleneck, paving the way toward
structurally aware and general-purpose planning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in configuring algorithm hyperparameters, particularly overcoming limitations like high sample complexity and poor generalization in learning-based methods.

Method: The paper presents AutoEP, a framework combining online Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) for real-time feedback and a multi-LLM reasoning chain to adaptively adjust hyperparameters without prior training.

Result: AutoEP outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including neural evolution and other LLM-based techniques, across various metaheuristics and combinatorial optimization benchmarks. It enables open-source models to achieve results comparable to GPT-4.

Conclusion: The study introduces a novel and accessible paradigm for adaptive hyperparameter configuration using LLMs, showcasing practical performance improvements and broad applicability.

Abstract: Dynamically configuring algorithm hyperparameters is a fundamental challenge
in computational intelligence. While learning-based methods offer automation,
they suffer from prohibitive sample complexity and poor generalization. We
introduce AutoEP, a novel framework that bypasses training entirely by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot reasoning engines for
algorithm control. AutoEP's core innovation lies in a tight synergy between two
components: (1) an online Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module that
provides real-time, quantitative feedback on the search dynamics, and (2) a
multi-LLM reasoning chain that interprets this feedback to generate adaptive
hyperparameter strategies. This approach grounds high-level reasoning in
empirical data, mitigating hallucination. Evaluated on three distinct
metaheuristics across diverse combinatorial optimization benchmarks, AutoEP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuners, including neural evolution
and other LLM-based methods. Notably, our framework enables open-source models
like Qwen3-30B to match the performance of GPT-4, demonstrating a powerful and

*Runyan Tan,Shuang Wu,Phillip Howard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel token sampling method called $p$-less sampling to improve the performance and efficiency of large language models (LLMs) during text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling strategies for LLMs depend on hyperparameters and are sensitive to task-specific settings, leading to potential performance degradation in generating outputs.

Method: The authors introduce $p$-less sampling, an information-theoretic method that sets a dynamic truncation threshold for token sampling based on the entire token probability distribution, eliminating the need for hyperparameters.

Result: Experiments show $p$-less sampling consistently outperforms current methods in tasks like math, reasoning, and creative writing, with less quality degradation at higher temperatures and improved inference-time efficiency.

Conclusion: $p$-less sampling provides a robust, parameter-free, and efficient alternative to existing methods, offering higher quality outputs and better computational efficiency in LLM tasks.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often
depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to
probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a
variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be
sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different
settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In
this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to
sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step
based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods,
$p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality
outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on
$p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to
empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical
reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less
sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting
much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further
show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative
methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation
lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to
highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies,
and diversity assessments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With advancements in LLMs and their integration into edge computing, there is a need to deploy reasoning and decision-making capabilities at the edge while addressing computational and resource limitations.

Method: The authors propose a distributed framework leveraging adaptive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for reasoning enhancement and distributed Mixture of Experts (MoE) for scalable deployment, tailoring the system dynamically to task complexity and device capability.

Result: Experimental evaluations in mobile edge environments show the framework successfully balances high reasoning quality with resource efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework validates the potential of deploying LLM reasoning in resource-constrained edge environments, proving its feasibility in real-world applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled an
emergence of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) with powerful reasoning and
autonomous decision-making capabilities. This integration with edge computing
has led to the development of Mobile Edge General Intelligence (MEGI), which
brings real-time, privacy-preserving reasoning to the network edge. However,
deploying LLM-based agentic AI reasoning in MEGI environments poses significant
challenges due to the high computational demands of reasoning and the limited
resources of edge devices. To address these challenges, we propose a joint
optimization framework for efficient LLM reasoning deployment in MEGI. First,
we review methods that enhance LLM reasoning capabilities, such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Mixture of
Experts (MoE). Next, we present a distributed framework that addresses two
correlated aspects: reasoning enhancement through adaptive CoT prompting and
scalable deployment through distributed MoE architecture. The framework
dynamically activates expert networks and adjusts reasoning depth based on task
complexity and device capabilities. We further conduct experimental evaluations
in mobile edge environments. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in balancing reasoning quality with resource efficiency,
validating the practical viability of deploying sophisticated LLM reasoning
capabilities in resource-constrained MEGI environments.

### [29] [Training Vision-Language Process Reward Models for Test-Time Scaling in Multimodal Reasoning: Key Insights and Lessons Learned](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23250)
*Brandon Ong,Tej Deep Pala,Vernon Toh,William Chandra Tjhi,Soujanya Poria*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces advancements in designing and applying Vision-Language Process Reward Models (VL-PRMs) to improve multimodal reasoning in Vision Language Models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in reliability and generalization of existing Vision-Language Process Reward Models (VL-PRMs), particularly regarding noisy supervision signals and task-specific dependencies.

Method: The paper proposes three key contributions: (1) a hybrid data synthesis framework combining Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with VLM judgments for accurate labeling, (2) perception-focused supervision to detect visual grounding errors, and (3) systematic evaluation of test-time scaling strategies for guiding reasoning in VLMs.

Result: Key findings include: (i) VL-PRMs as Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) outperform step-by-step guidance, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can rival larger counterparts in error detection, (iii) VL-PRMs enhance reasoning in advanced VLMs, (iv) perception-focused supervision significantly improves outcomes, and (v) advanced math reasoning datasets benefit from test-time scaling despite no prior training on them.

Conclusion: The proposed VL-PRM framework demonstrates improved reasoning capabilities and task adaptability, revealing latent abilities in VLMs and encouraging further exploration into multimodal models.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the
reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been
extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language
Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce
noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work,
we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies
for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce
a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a
strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose
perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at
the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate
multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide
VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse
multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and
MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome
Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM
guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass
larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning
abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to
significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different
policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training
VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and
support the advancement of VLMs.

### [30] [GUI-PRA: Process Reward Agent for GUI Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23263)
*Tao Xiong,Xavier Hu,Yurun Chen,Yuhang Liu,Changqiao Wu,Pengzhi Gao,Wei Liu,Jian Luan,Shengyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents GUI-PRA, a judge agent, designed to improve task automation capabilities in GUI environments by overcoming limitations of existing Process Reward Models (PRMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language model-based GUI agents face inefficiencies in addressing long-horizon GUI tasks. Traditional Process Reward Models (PRMs) lack dynamic awareness and get overwhelmed by extensive historical contexts, leading to process evaluation failures.

Method: GUI-PRA introduces two innovations: a dynamic memory mechanism with Relevance-based Retrieval and Progressive Summarization Modules to handle long histories, and an Adaptive UI Perception to interpret dynamic UI changes and enhance context-aware decision-making.

Result: GUI-PRA outperforms traditional PRMs by efficiently processing historical context and dynamically assessing UI states, ensuring better reward evaluations in challenging GUI tasks.

Conclusion: GUI-PRA addresses critical limitations of traditional PRMs, showing improved adaptability and performance in managing complex, dynamic GUI tasks through better context awareness and state change reasoning.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show significant potential for automating tasks. However, they
often struggle with long-horizon tasks, leading to frequent failures. Process
Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising solution, as they can guide these agents
with crucial process signals during inference. Nevertheless, their application
to the GUI domain presents unique challenges. When processing dense artificial
inputs with long history data, PRMs suffer from a "lost in the middle"
phenomenon, where the overwhelming historical context compromises the
evaluation of the current step. Furthermore, standard PRMs lacks GUI changing
awareness, providing static evaluations that are disconnected from the dynamic
consequences of actions, a critical mismatch with the inherently dynamic nature
of GUI tasks. In response to these challenges, we introduce GUI-PRA (Process
Reward Agent for GUI Tasks), a judge agent designed to better provide process
reward than standard PRM by intelligently processing historical context and
actively perceiving UI state changes. Specifically, to directly combat the
``lost in the middle'' phenomenon, we introduce a dynamic memory mechanism
consisting of two core components: a Relevance-based Retrieval Module to
actively fetch pertinent information from long histories and a Progressive
Summarization Module to dynamically condense growing interaction data, ensuring
the model focuses on relevant context. Moreover, to address the lack of UI
changing awareness, we introduce an Aadaptive UI Perception mechanism. This
mechanism enables the agent to reason about UI state changes and dynamically
select the most appropriate tool to gather grounded visual evidence, ensuring
its evaluation is always informed by the current UI context.

*Yuxinyue Qian,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops models combining human and AI agents to evaluate their impact on social output, showing AI greatly boosts productivity, especially with network effects and independent production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze how the integration of AI into socio-economic systems influences social output and its dynamics under resource constraints.

Method: Developed and simulated five agent-based models, progressively incorporating AI agents, network effects, and independent production capabilities.

Result: AI dramatically increases social output, with nonlinear growth under network effects and enhanced long-term potential through independent production.

Conclusion: Utilizing AI collaboration, network effects, and independent production results in significant improvements in aggregate social output, showcasing increasing returns to scale.

Abstract: Modern socio-economic systems are undergoing deep integration with artificial
intelligence technologies. This paper constructs a heterogeneous agent-based
modeling framework that incorporates both human workers and autonomous AI
agents, to study the impact of AI collaboration under resource constraints on
aggregate social output. We build five progressively extended models: Model 1
serves as the baseline of pure human collaboration; Model 2 introduces AI as
collaborators; Model 3 incorporates network effects among agents; Model 4
treats agents as independent producers; and Model 5 integrates both network
effects and independent agent production. Through theoretical derivation and
simulation analysis, we find that the introduction of AI agents can
significantly increase aggregate social output. When considering network
effects among agents, this increase exhibits nonlinear growth far exceeding the
simple sum of individual contributions. Under the same resource inputs,
treating agents as independent producers provides higher long-term growth
potential; introducing network effects further demonstrates strong
characteristics of increasing returns to scale.

*Yifei Chen,Guanting Dong,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tool-Light, a framework to optimize large language models in utilizing tool-integrated reasoning efficiently and accurately, addressing challenges like improper tool usage and unstable reasoning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address deficiencies in current large language models employing tool-integrated reasoning, which often result in inefficient and inconsistent tool usage during reasoning.

Method: The authors explored reasoning patterns using information entropy and proposed the Tool-Light framework, which includes continuous self-evolved sampling and a two-stage fine-tuning process (Supervised Fine-Tuning and Self-Evolved Direct Preference Optimization).

Result: The Tool-Light framework demonstrated significant improvements in the efficiency and accuracy of tool-integrated reasoning on 10 different datasets.

Conclusion: Tool-Light successfully stabilizes and optimizes tool-integrated reasoning processes, enhancing the overall capability of large language models for efficient reasoning.

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) enables large language models (LLMs) to
improve their internal reasoning ability by integrating external tools.
However, models employing TIR often display suboptimal behaviors, such as
insufficient or excessive tool usage and overthinking after tool calls. The
challenge of incentivizing LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately,
while stabilizing the reasoning process, remains an open question. In this
paper, we start by exploring the impact of tool calls on model reasoning from
the perspective of information entropy. Our findings indicate that tool call
results lead to a distinct change in the information entropy of subsequent
reasoning, with the overall entropy of the reasoning chain varying based on the
number of tool calls. Building on these insights, we propose Tool-Light, a
framework designed to encourage LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately.
Our framework includes dataset construction and multi-stage fine-tuning. For
dataset construction, we employ continuous self-evolved sampling using the
fine-tuned model, integrating both vanilla sampling and entropy-guided
sampling. Besides, we establish strict criteria for selecting positive-negative
pairs during sampling. The training process involves a two-stage approach,
comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Self-Evolved Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on 10 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Tool-Light, significantly improving the model's efficiency in
executing TIR tasks.

*Ningning Xu,Yuxuan Jiang,Shubhashis Roy Dipta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-stage framework that enhances large reasoning models (LRMs) by building competence in tool usage patterns and aligning them with teacher preferences, significantly improving performance on mathematical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the issue of tool misapplication in LRMs, which often leads to failures despite sound reasoning. It investigates how tools are applied, emphasizing the need for proper selection between computation-based and algorithmic patterns.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage framework: first, building code competence using tool application patterns (calculator and algorithmic), and second, aligning pattern selection with teaching preferences. The method is evaluated on challenging math datasets.

Result: The approach significantly improved tool usage and solution accuracy on datasets such as MATH500 and AIME24, improving Code@1 performance from 64.0% to 70.5% and 26.7% to 50.0%, respectively.

Conclusion: Tool-integrated reasoning improves when models are pattern-aware. Proper application and alignment with teacher preferences enhance the accuracy of reasoning models on complex mathematical problems.

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) has become a key approach for improving large
reasoning models (LRMs) on complex problems. Prior work has mainly studied when
to invoke tools, while overlooking how tools are applied. We identify two
common patterns: a calculator pattern that uses code for direct computation,
and an algorithmic pattern that encodes problems as programs. Misaligned
choices often cause failures even when reasoning is sound. We propose a
two-stage framework that first builds code competence from both patterns and
then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences. Across challenging math
datasets, our pattern-aware method substantially improves both code usage and
accuracy, for instance raising Code@1 on MATH500 from 64.0% to 70.5% and on
AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%. These gains highlight the effectiveness of a
pattern-aware approach for tool-integrated reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces JET (Just-Enough Thinking), which improves model reasoning efficiency by truncating unnecessary reasoning steps, achieving both shorter reasoning paths and high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency in deep reasoning models while maintaining their effectiveness, the study aims to improve reasoning efficiency for large reasoning models (LRMs).

Method: The authors propose JET, a reinforcement learning-based method that performs trajectory truncation during reasoning rollouts and employs a length reward system to balance reasoning conciseness with correctness.

Result: JET achieves significant improvements, with one example model (DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) showing a 4.6% accuracy gain and a reduction in output length by 46.3% on a key benchmark.

Conclusion: JET successfully enhances the efficiency of large reasoning models without sacrificing their accuracy, providing a novel approach to concise reasoning.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on
challenging tasks, yet their deep reasoning often incurs substantial
computational costs. To achieve efficient reasoning, existing reinforcement
learning methods still struggle to construct short reasoning path during the
rollout stage, limiting effective learning. Inspired by Evidence Accumulation
Models, we find that LRMs have accumulated sufficient information early in
reasoning, making further reasoning steps redundant. Based on this insight, we
propose Just-Enough Thinking (JET), which trains models to proactively
terminate unnecessary reasoning. JET performs trajectory truncation during
rollout to expose the model to short, distributionally consistent reasoning
paths. Besides, it uses a quality-controlled length reward to better encourage
concise reasoning while maintaining correctness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without
sacrificing accuracy. Especially, DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves a 4.6%
accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark.

*Gyubok Lee,Woosog Chay,Heeyoung Kwak,Yeong Hwa Kim,Haanju Yoo,Oksoon Jeong,Meong Hi Son,Edward Choi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces EHR-ChatQA, a benchmark for testing tools aimed at resolving query ambiguities in electronic health records, emphasizing robustness and diagnostic insights for real-world clinical scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), their adoption for accessing EHR data is limited by lack of appropriate benchmarks. Query ambiguity and value mismatch between user inputs and database records present deployment challenges.

Method: The authors developed EHR-ChatQA, a benchmark simulating clinical database interactions through two workflows: Incremental Query Refinement (IncreQA) and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA). It evaluates LLM performance in resolving ambiguities and generating accurate SQL queries.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs showed high Pass@5 scores (90-95% for IncreQA, 60-80% for AdaptQA), but their consistent success across all trials (Pass^5) dropped significantly by 35-60%.

Conclusion: The work highlights the need for more robust tools to ensure reliability in EHR systems and offers insights to address common failure modes in query processing agents.

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLM-powered agents, their adoption for
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data access remains limited by the absence of
benchmarks that adequately capture real-world clinical data access flows. In
practice, two core challenges hinder deployment: query ambiguity from vague
user questions and value mismatch between user terminology and database
entries. To address this, we introduce EHR-ChatQA an interactive database
question answering benchmark that evaluates the end-to-end workflow of database
agents: clarifying user questions, using tools to resolve value mismatches, and
generating correct SQL to deliver accurate answers. To cover diverse patterns
of query ambiguity and value mismatch, EHR-ChatQA assesses agents in a
simulated environment with an LLM-based user across two interaction flows:
Incremental Query Refinement (IncreQA), where users add constraints to existing
queries, and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA), where users adjust their
search goals mid-conversation. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g.,
o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash) over five i.i.d. trials show that while agents
achieve high Pass@5 of 90-95% (at least one of five trials) on IncreQA and
60-80% on AdaptQA, their Pass^5 (consistent success across all five trials) is
substantially lower by 35-60%. These results underscore the need to build
agents that are not only performant but also robust for the safety-critical EHR
domain. Finally, we provide diagnostic insights into common failure modes to
guide future agent development.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of building versatile AI scientists hindered by rigid workflows and lack of unified environments.

Method: ToolUniverse integrates more than 600 resources, standardizes tool interactions, refines interfaces, enables tool generation, and optimizes workflows. It supports seamless composition of computational tools for experimental tasks.

Result: ToolUniverse successfully created an AI scientist in a hypercholesterolemia case study, identifying a promising drug analog with favorable predicted properties.

Conclusion: ToolUniverse demonstrates the potential for AI scientists to autonomously explore scientific problems using an integrated and optimized ecosystem for tool collaboration.

Abstract: AI scientists are emerging computational systems that serve as collaborative

bespoke, tied to rigid workflows, and lack shared environments that unify
tools, data, and analyses into a common ecosystem. In omics, unified ecosystems
have transformed research by enabling interoperability, reuse, and
community-driven development; AI scientists require comparable infrastructure.
We present ToolUniverse, an ecosystem for building AI scientists from any
language or reasoning model, whether open or closed. TOOLUNIVERSE standardizes
how AI scientists identify and call tools, integrating more than 600 machine
learning models, datasets, APIs, and scientific packages for data analysis,
knowledge retrieval, and experimental design. It automatically refines tool
interfaces for correct use by AI scientists, creates new tools from natural
language descriptions, iteratively optimizes tool specifications, and composes
tools into agentic workflows. In a case study of hypercholesterolemia,
ToolUniverse was used to create an AI scientist to identify a potent analog of

*Charles E. Gagnon,Steven H. H. Ding,Philippe Charland,Benjamin C. M. Fung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a language model-based method for binary code similarity detection, combining interpretability, scalability, and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current methods in binary code similarity detection, which either lack interpretability or generalizability or face a trade-off between scalability and accuracy.

Method: The authors employ a language model-based agent to analyze assembly code and generate human-readable and directly searchable features like input/output types, algorithmic intent, and side effects.

Result: The proposed method achieves competitive recall@1 in cross-architecture and cross-optimization tasks without training (42% and 62%) and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods when combined with embeddings.

Conclusion: The method bridges the gaps in current approaches, showing that it is possible to balance accuracy, scalability, and interpretability in binary code similarity detection.

Abstract: Binary code similarity detection is a core task in reverse engineering. It
supports malware analysis and vulnerability discovery by identifying
semantically similar code in different contexts. Modern methods have progressed
from manually engineered features to vector representations. Hand-crafted
statistics (e.g., operation ratios) are interpretable, but shallow and fail to
generalize. Embedding-based methods overcome this by learning robust
cross-setting representations, but these representations are opaque vectors
that prevent rapid verification. They also face a scalability-accuracy
trade-off, since high-dimensional nearest-neighbor search requires
approximations that reduce precision. Current approaches thus force a
compromise between interpretability, generalizability, and scalability.
  We bridge these gaps using a language model-based agent to conduct structured
reasoning analysis of assembly code and generate features such as input/output
types, side effects, notable constants, and algorithmic intent. Unlike
hand-crafted features, they are richer and adaptive. Unlike embeddings, they
are human-readable, maintainable, and directly searchable with inverted or
relational indexes. Without any matching training, our method respectively
achieves 42% and 62% for recall@1 in cross-architecture and cross-optimization
tasks, comparable to embedding methods with training (39% and 34%). Combined
with embeddings, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art,
demonstrating that accuracy, scalability, and interpretability can coexist.

TL;DR: This paper presents ViTSP, a novel framework utilizing pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLMs) to solve large-scale Traveling Salesman Problems (TSPs) efficiently, offering scalability and minimal optimality gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is fundamental but challenging due to its NP-hard nature where traditional methods struggle with scalability, and learning-based approaches face poor generalization and limited training data.

Method: The proposed ViTSP uses pre-trained VLMs to visually identify promising small-scale subproblems in TSP instances, optimized further using off-the-shelf solvers without requiring additional dedicated training.

Result: ViTSP achieves superior performance on real-world TSPs with up to 88k nodes, achieving average optimality gaps below 0.2% and outperforming the best heuristic solver, LKH-3, in gap reduction by 12%-100%.

Conclusion: ViTSP provides a significant hybrid approach by integrating pre-trained generative models with traditional solvers, enabling scalable solutions for combinatorial optimization problems, with potential real-world applications in complex logistics systems.

Abstract: Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is NP-hard yet fundamental for wide
real-world applications. Classical exact methods face challenges in scaling,
and heuristic methods often require domain-specific parameter calibration.
While learning-based approaches have shown promise, they suffer from poor
generalization and limited scalability due to fixed training data. This work
proposes ViTSP, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained vision language
models (VLMs) to visually guide the solution process for large-scale TSPs. The
VLMs function to identify promising small-scale subproblems from a visualized
TSP instance, which are then efficiently optimized using an off-the-shelf
solver to improve the global solution. ViTSP bypasses the dedicated model
training at the user end while maintaining effectiveness across diverse
instances. Experiments on real-world TSP instances ranging from 1k to 88k nodes
demonstrate that ViTSP consistently achieves solutions with average optimality
gaps below 0.2%, outperforming existing learning-based methods. Under the same
runtime budget, it surpasses the best-performing heuristic solver, LKH-3, by
reducing its gaps by 12% to 100%, particularly on very-large-scale instances
with more than 10k nodes. Our framework offers a new perspective in hybridizing
pre-trained generative models and operations research solvers in solving
combinatorial optimization problems, with practical implications for
integration into more complex logistics systems. The code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces GeoBS, an information-theoretic framework for evaluating geographic bias (geo-bias) in AI models, addressing the lack of a unified, model-agnostic, spatially explicit approach to this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked issue of geographic bias in AI models and develop a fair, comparative framework for evaluating and understanding spatial bias factors.

Method: Proposes the GeoBS framework, which includes three novel geo-bias scores considering spatial factors like multi-scalability, distance decay, and anisotropy. The framework is tested across 3 tasks, 8 datasets, and 8 models.

Result: Demonstrated that both task-specific GeoAI models and general-purpose foundation models exhibit diverse types of geographic bias through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: GeoBS provides a universal framework to analyze geo-bias, facilitating the incorporation of spatial fairness in AI system design and evaluation processes.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of AI models, especially foundation models (FMs), has
made a profound impact on numerous domains. However, it also raises significant
ethical concerns, including bias issues. Although numerous efforts have been
made to quantify and mitigate social bias in AI models, geographic bias (in
short, geo-bias) receives much less attention, which presents unique
challenges. While previous work has explored ways to quantify geo-bias, these
measures are model-specific (e.g., mean absolute deviation of LLM ratings) or
spatially implicit (e.g., average fairness scores of all spatial partitions).
We lack a model-agnostic, universally applicable, and spatially explicit
geo-bias evaluation framework that allows researchers to fairly compare the
geo-bias of different AI models and to understand what spatial factors
contribute to the geo-bias. In this paper, we establish an
information-theoretic framework for geo-bias evaluation, called GeoBS (Geo-Bias
Scores). We demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed framework by
showing how to interpret and analyze existing geo-bias measures under this
framework. Then, we propose three novel geo-bias scores that explicitly take
intricate spatial factors (multi-scalability, distance decay, and anisotropy)
into consideration. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 tasks, 8
datasets, and 8 models to demonstrate that both task-specific GeoAI models and
general-purpose foundation models may suffer from various types of geo-bias.
This framework will not only advance the technical understanding of geographic
bias but will also establish a foundation for integrating spatial fairness into
the design, deployment, and evaluation of AI systems.

TL;DR: The paper aims to address educational inequality by improving adaptive learning models with a novel probabilistic framework and releasing the largest open dataset for mathematics exams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in tackling social inequality by making high-quality tutoring accessible to all, leveraging AI tutors to offer scalable, affordable alternatives.

Method: The researchers introduce a probabilistic modeling framework based on Item Response Theory (IRT) and a novel discrete variational inference method, using the largest open dataset of formal mathematics exam responses.

Result: Their framework achieves over 80% prediction accuracy, improves low-data settings performance, and outperforms classical IRT and matrix factorization baselines.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the use of latent ability parameters for accurate predictions and demonstrate the effectiveness of their novel approach in addressing educational disparities.

Abstract: One of the largest drivers of social inequality is unequal access to personal
tutoring, with wealthier individuals able to afford it, while the majority
cannot. Affordable, effective AI tutors offer a scalable solution. We focus on
adaptive learning, predicting whether a student will answer a question
correctly, a key component of any effective tutoring system. Yet many platforms
struggle to achieve high prediction accuracy, especially in data-sparse
settings. To address this, we release the largest open dataset of
professionally marked formal mathematics exam responses to date. We introduce a
probabilistic modelling framework rooted in Item Response Theory (IRT) that
achieves over 80 percent accuracy, setting a new benchmark for mathematics
prediction accuracy of formal exam papers. Extending this, our collaborative
filtering models incorporate topic-level skill profiles, but reveal a
surprising and educationally significant finding, a single latent ability
parameter alone is needed to achieve the maximum predictive accuracy. Our main
contribution though is deriving and implementing a novel discrete variational
inference framework, achieving our highest prediction accuracy in low-data
settings and outperforming all classical IRT and matrix factorisation
baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces benchmark signatures to analyze large language model (LLM) performance, focusing on token perplexity from training data and capturing variations across diverse LLM benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in current mainstream LLM benchmark agreement studies and explore overlapping capacities and divergences among benchmarks.

Method: The authors use meta-evaluation across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks, applying stepwise forward selection with linear regressions to derive benchmark signatures based on token perplexity.

Result: The study reveals semantic and performance overlaps across benchmarks, identifies less similarity in cultural and multilingual domains, and highlights the impact of non-benchmark factors like question format.

Conclusion: Benchmark signatures offer robust insights into LLM capabilities, limitations, and interconnected domain functionalities, addressing issues in traditional benchmark assessment methods.

Abstract: We develop signatures of capacity familiarity to characterize large language
model (LLM) benchmarks and their meaningful overlaps. Benchmark signatures
probe the capacity required for benchmark performance. We formally define them
as a set of salient tokens drawn from in-the-wild, naturally authored corpora,
where LLM token perplexity, reflecting more or less pre-training exposure,
becomes highly predictive of LLM benchmark performance. Through a large-scale
meta-evaluation, we extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection
with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse
knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, and
world modeling. Our analysis situates signatures in relation to both the
semantic similarity of benchmark questions and the correlation of model
performance. While performance overlaps are universally high and semantic
overlaps remain confined to a narrow mid-range, benchmark signatures prove
highly informative in capturing variation, overlap, and divergence. We observe
overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, whereas multilingual and cultural
benchmarks exhibit less similarity, even compared to cross-task overlap.
Notably, performance-level results are strongly influenced by
benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, highlighting limitations
in LLM generalization, the conflation of performance with ability, and issues
inherent in current mainstream benchmark agreement studies. Benchmark
signatures, however, remain robust to such effects. Ultimately, we identify
cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following,
and world modeling, with coding emerging as the least overlapping domain.
Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity
and LLM sensitivities, and sketch the underlying landscape of interconnected
LLM capabilities.

### [42] [Dynamic Trust Calibration Using Contextual Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23497)
*Bruno M. Henrique,Eugene Santos Jr*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the crucial issue of trust calibration between humans and AI, presenting a novel methodology for its objective measurement and evaluation. By utilizing Contextual Bandits, it achieves dynamic assessment resulting in performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trust calibration is essential for optimal decision-making in human-AI collaborations, yet existing methods lack standardization, broader applicability, and clear metrics.

Method: The authors introduce a standardized trust calibration measure and an indicator based on Contextual Bandits, which dynamically incorporates context into trust evaluation.

Result: Experimental analysis across three datasets reveals significant improvements in decision-making, with reward metrics increasing by 10 to 38%.

Conclusion: The proposed approach not only enhances understanding of trust calibration but also guides the development of trustworthy AI systems in sensitive domains like healthcare and criminal justice.

Abstract: Trust calibration between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is crucial
for optimal decision-making in collaborative settings. Excessive trust can lead
users to accept AI-generated outputs without question, overlooking critical
flaws, while insufficient trust may result in disregarding valuable insights
from AI systems, hindering performance. Despite its importance, there is
currently no definitive and objective method for measuring trust calibration
between humans and AI. Current approaches lack standardization and consistent
metrics that can be broadly applied across various contexts, and they don't
distinguish between the formation of opinions and subsequent human decisions.
In this work, we propose a novel and objective method for dynamic trust
calibration, introducing a standardized trust calibration measure and an
indicator. By utilizing Contextual Bandits-an adaptive algorithm that
incorporates context into decision-making-our indicator dynamically assesses
when to trust AI contributions based on learned contextual information. We
evaluate this indicator across three diverse datasets, demonstrating that
effective trust calibration results in significant improvements in
decision-making performance, as evidenced by 10 to 38% increase in reward
metrics. These findings not only enhance theoretical understanding but also
provide practical guidance for developing more trustworthy AI systems
supporting decisions in critical domains, for example, disease diagnoses and
criminal justice.

### [43] [Model Consistency as a Cheap yet Predictive Proxy for LLM Elo Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23510)
*Ashwin Ramaswamy,Nestor Demeure,Ermal Rrapaj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a metric that uses LLMs themselves to evaluate the Elo scores of other LLMs, reducing dependence on human evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid release of new LLMs with varying performance creates a need for independent, cost-effective evaluation methods.

Method: The authors propose using an LLM's consistency in selecting the best model in matchups as a proxy metric for its Elo score, which is highly correlated with human-evaluated scores.

Result: The proposed metric showed a 91% correlation with human-produced Elo scores, confirming its effectiveness and reducing reliance on human involvement.

Conclusion: This method offers a cheap and efficient way to evaluate LLMs, mitigating the costs and dependency on human evaluators for Elo scoring.

Abstract: New large language models (LLMs) are being released every day. Some perform
significantly better or worse than expected given their parameter count.
Therefore, there is a need for a method to independently evaluate models. The
current best way to evaluate a model is to measure its Elo score by comparing
it to other models in a series of contests - an expensive operation since
humans are ideally required to compare LLM outputs. We observe that when an LLM
is asked to judge such contests, the consistency with which it selects a model
as the best in a matchup produces a metric that is 91% correlated with its own
human-produced Elo score. This provides a simple proxy for Elo scores that can
be computed cheaply, without any human data or prior knowledge.

### [45] [Diagnosing Failure Root Causes in Platform-Orchestrated Agentic Systems: Dataset, Taxonomy, and Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23735)
*Xuyan Ma,Xiaofei Xie,Yawen Wang,Junjie Wang,Boyu Wu,Mingyang Li,Qing Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the failures of platform-orchestrated agentic systems (multi-agent LLM systems), creating a dataset, taxonomy, and benchmark to improve root cause identification, but faces challenges with low accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the fragility of platform-orchestrated agentic systems and systematically identify the root causes of their failures, which is currently unclear.

Method: The study creates a dataset (AgentFail) with 307 failure logs, uses counterfactual reasoning for annotation reliability, develops a taxonomy for failure root causes, and introduces a benchmark framework leveraging LLMs for detection guidance.

Result: The taxonomy enhances the root cause identification process using LLMs, but the achieved accuracy is only 33.6%, showing the task's complexity. They provide actionable guidelines based on these findings.

Conclusion: The paper offers valuable resources like a dataset, taxonomy, and benchmark to address the challenges in failure analysis, laying a foundation for developing more reliable agentic systems.

Abstract: Agentic systems consisting of multiple LLM-driven agents coordinating through
tools and structured interactions, are increasingly deployed for complex
reasoning and problem-solving tasks. At the same time, emerging low-code and
template-based agent development platforms (e.g., Dify) enable users to rapidly
build and orchestrate agentic systems, which we refer to as
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. However, these systems are also fragile
and it remains unclear how to systematically identify their potential failure
root cause. This paper presents a study of root cause identification of these
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. To support this initiative, we construct
a dataset AgentFail containing 307 failure logs from ten agentic systems, each
with fine-grained annotations linking failures to their root causes. We
additionally utilize counterfactual reasoning-based repair strategy to ensure
the reliability of the annotation. Building on the dataset, we develop a
taxonomy that characterizes failure root causes and analyze their distribution
across different platforms and task domains. Furthermore, we introduce a
benchmark that leverages LLMs for automatically identifying root causes, in
which we also utilize the proposed taxonomy as guidance for LLMs. Results show
that the taxonomy can largely improve the performance, thereby confirming its
utility. Nevertheless, the accuracy of root cause identification reaches at
most 33.6%, which indicates that this task still remains challenging. In light
of these results, we also provide actionable guidelines for building such
agentic systems. In summary, this paper provides a reliable dataset of failure
root cause for platform-orchestrated agentic systems, corresponding taxonomy
and benchmark, which serves as a foundation for advancing the development of
more reliable agentic systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores a method where multiple Large Language Model (LLM) agents collaborate through iterative proposals and voting to reach consensus, yielding results that outperform or match single-LLM baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether multiple LLM agents working collaboratively through orchestration can enhance task performance compared to single LLM approaches.

Method: They use four LLMs interacting in an iterative question-answer format with voting mechanisms, applied to three datasets, and perform benchmark tests as well as ablation studies to analyze the effects of revealing authorship and vote visibility on the system.

Result: Orchestration achieves better or comparable results to single-LLM baselines and shows potential for improvement. Revealing authorship increased self-voting and ties, while showing votes amplified herding behavior.

Conclusion: Multi-agent orchestration is a promising approach that frequently outperforms single LLM setups, but its dynamics (like herding and self-voting) warrant further study to maximize its potential.

Abstract: We study multi-turn multi-agent orchestration, where multiple large language
model (LLM) agents interact over multiple turns by iteratively proposing
answers or casting votes until reaching consensus. Using four LLMs (Gemini 2.5
Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, and Claude Sonnet 4) on GPQA-Diamond, IFEval, and MuSR, we
conduct two experiments: (i) benchmarking orchestration against single-LLM
baselines; and (ii) ablations on GPQA-Diamond that vary whether agents see who
authored answers and whether they can observe ongoing votes. Orchestration
matches or exceeds the strongest single model and consistently outperforms the
others. Analysis of best-achievable orchestration performance shows potential
for further gains. The ablations show that revealing authorship increases
self-voting and ties, and that showing ongoing votes amplifies herding, which
speeds convergence but can sometimes yield premature consensus.

### [47] [AgentGuard: Runtime Verification of AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23864)
*Roham Koohestani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentGuard is a framework for runtime verification of autonomous AI systems using Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the risks of unpredictability and emergent behaviors in agentic AI systems, which render traditional verification methods ineffective.

Method: Developed AgentGuard, which uses an inspection layer to monitor raw agent I/O, abstracts this into events, dynamically builds a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model using online learning, and applies probabilistic model checking.

Result: AgentGuard provides continuous, quantitative assurance by verifying emergent behaviors of agentic AI systems in real time.

Conclusion: Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance can effectively address the verification challenges posed by emergent behaviors in autonomous AI systems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution to autonomous, agentic AI systems introduces significant
risks due to their inherent unpredictability and emergent behaviors; this also
renders traditional verification methods inadequate and necessitates a shift
towards probabilistic guarantees where the question is no longer if a system
will fail, but the probability of its failure within given constraints. This
paper presents AgentGuard, a framework for runtime verification of Agentic AI
systems that provides continuous, quantitative assurance through a new paradigm
called Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance. AgentGuard operates as an inspection
layer that observes an agent's raw I/O and abstracts it into formal events
corresponding to transitions in a state model. It then uses online learning to
dynamically build and update a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that formally
models the agent's emergent behavior. Using probabilistic model checking, the
framework then verifies quantitative properties in real-time.

*Zhaoqi Wang,Daqing He,Zijian Zhang,Xin Li,Liehuang Zhu,Meng Li,Jiamou Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the PASS framework to enhance the effectiveness of prompt jailbreaking attacks on large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the need to address security vulnerabilities in large language models, particularly in cases where adversaries manipulate prompts to deviate from the intended alignment of LLMs.

Method: The proposed PASS framework uses reinforcement learning to transform jailbreak prompts into more discreet and effective formalized descriptions. Additionally, it structures outputs into a GraphRAG system for enhanced attack performance.

Result: Experiments on open-source language models reveal that the PASS framework effectively bypasses existing defenses and improves the success rate of jailbreak attacks.

Conclusion: The study highlights vulnerabilities in current LLM defenses and emphasizes the need for more robust alignment strategies to counter advanced attacks like those facilitated by the PASS framework.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
they also introduce novel security challenges. For instance, prompt
jailbreaking attacks involve adversaries crafting sophisticated prompts to
elicit responses from LLMs that deviate from human values. To uncover
vulnerabilities in LLM alignment methods, we propose the PASS framework
(\underline{P}rompt J\underline{a}ilbreaking via \underline{S}emantic and
\underline{S}tructural Formalization). Specifically, PASS employs reinforcement
learning to transform initial jailbreak prompts into formalized descriptions,
which enhances stealthiness and enables bypassing existing alignment defenses.
The jailbreak outputs are then structured into a GraphRAG system that, by
leveraging extracted relevant terms and formalized symbols as contextual input
alongside the original query, strengthens subsequent attacks and facilitates
more effective jailbreaks. We conducted extensive experiments on common
open-source models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our attack.

*ChaoBo Zhang,Long Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces TCM-HEDPR, a personalized hierarchical recommendation model for Chinese herbal medicine, addressing patient personalization, herb data bias, and herb compatibility challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription models, such as lack of patient-specific information, biases in herb data distribution, and ignoring herb compatibility.

Method: Utilizing a hierarchical structure-enhanced model with patient-personalized prompts, in conjunction with knowledge graph-guided diffusion techniques and heterogeneous graph networks.

Result: Extensive experiments show improved efficacy of TCM-HEDPR across public and clinical datasets, with prescriptions evaluated using insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology.

Conclusion: TCM-HEDPR improves personalized TCM prescription recommendations, setting a new paradigm for integrating AI and modern medicine for traditional practices.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence technology plays a crucial role in recommending
prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Previous studies have
made significant progress by focusing on the symptom-herb relationship in
prescriptions. However, several limitations hinder model performance: (i)
Insufficient attention to patient-personalized information such as age, BMI,
and medical history, which hampers accurate identification of syndrome and
reduces efficacy. (ii) The typical long-tailed distribution of herb data
introduces training biases and affects generalization ability. (iii) The
oversight of the 'monarch, minister, assistant and envoy' compatibility among
herbs increases the risk of toxicity or side effects, opposing the 'treatment
based on syndrome differentiation' principle in clinical TCM. Therefore, we
propose a novel hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation
model for TCM formulas based on knowledge graph diffusion guidance, namely
TCM-HEDPR. Specifically, we pre-train symptom representations using
patient-personalized prompt sequences and apply prompt-oriented contrastive
learning for data augmentation. Furthermore, we employ a KG-guided homogeneous
graph diffusion method integrated with a self-attention mechanism to globally
capture the non-linear symptom-herb relationship. Lastly, we design a
heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing
relationships with implicit syndromes, guiding the prescription generation
process at a fine-grained level and mitigating the long-tailed herb data
distribution problem. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one
clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. In addition, we
incorporate insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology to evaluate
the recommended prescriptions comprehensively. It can provide a new paradigm
for the recommendation of modern TCM.

TL;DR: The paper presents PrefCleanBench, a benchmark for evaluating data cleaning methods in aligning large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human feedback is essential for aligning LLMs with human preferences, but noisy and inconsistent feedback poses challenges.

Method: PrefCleanBench evaluates 13 data cleaning methods under a standardized protocol, focusing on alignment performance and generalizability.

Result: Key factors for successful data cleaning in LLM alignment tasks are identified through a unified and rigorous comparison.

Conclusion: The research underscores the importance of data preprocessing in AI alignment and provides modular tools for further study.

Abstract: Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent,
which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While
various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this
issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability
remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of
LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning
strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across
diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying
disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that
determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays
the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM
alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but
underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We
release modular implementations of all methods to catalyze further research:

TL;DR: The paper proposes BridgeDrive, a new method for autonomous driving trajectory planning using anchor-guided diffusion bridges, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of effectively guiding diffusion-based planners in reactive, closed-loop autonomous driving scenarios.

Method: The method involves introducing BridgeDrive, which uses a principled diffusion framework to translate driving anchors into detailed trajectory plans, compatible with efficient ODE solvers.

Result: BridgeDrive achieved state-of-the-art performance, improving the success rate by 5% on the Bench2Drive benchmark compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: BridgeDrive offers a theoretically consistent and practical approach for real-time trajectory planning in autonomous driving, showing notable improvements in performance.

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown great promise for autonomous driving due
to their ability to capture multi-modal driving behaviors. However, guiding
these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a
significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient
guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use
typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but
relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies
and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a
novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory
planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that
effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans,
appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is
compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time
autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PSG-Agent, a system for creating personalized and dynamic guardrails for LLM-based agents to address two key limitations: lack of user-specific guardrail policies and tracking of risks over multiple interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inherent safety risks in deploying LLM-based agents, specifically focusing on personalized user safety and dynamic risk tracking over interactions.

Method: PSG-Agent uses interaction history for stable traits and real-time query states to create personalized guardrails. It also employs continuous monitoring through specialized tools like Plan Monitor, Tool Firewall, Response Guard, and Memory Guardian to track risks across multiple interactions.

Result: PSG-Agent demonstrated superior performance in scenarios like healthcare, finance, and daily life automation with diverse user profiles, surpassing existing guardrail solutions such as LlamaGuard3 and AGrail.

Conclusion: PSG-Agent provides a scalable, executable, and auditable system for personalized safety in LLM-based agents, addressing both individual user needs and dynamic risk management effectively.

Abstract: Effective guardrails are essential for safely deploying LLM-based agents in
critical applications. Despite recent advances, existing guardrails suffer from
two fundamental limitations: (i) they apply uniform guardrail policies to all
users, ignoring that the same agent behavior can harm some users while being
safe for others; (ii) they check each response in isolation, missing how risks
evolve and accumulate across multiple interactions. To solve these issues, we
propose PSG-Agent, a personalized and dynamic system for LLM-based agents.
First, PSG-Agent creates personalized guardrails by mining the interaction
history for stable traits and capturing real-time states from current queries,
generating user-specific risk thresholds and protection strategies. Second,
PSG-Agent implements continuous monitoring across the agent pipeline with
specialized guards, including Plan Monitor, Tool Firewall, Response Guard,
Memory Guardian, that track cross-turn risk accumulation and issue verifiable
verdicts. Finally, we validate PSG-Agent in multiple scenarios including
healthcare, finance, and daily life automation scenarios with diverse user
profiles. It significantly outperform existing agent guardrails including
LlamaGuard3 and AGrail, providing an executable and auditable path toward
personalized safety for LLM-based agents.

TL;DR: This paper investigates Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception, categorizing key error patterns, analyzing system components, and highlighting their performance under different conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges and limitations in existing V2X cooperative perception systems, including errors in prediction and their insufficiently explored causes.

Method: Conducted an empirical study, systematically identifying six error patterns and assessing system performance through large-scale evaluation.

Result: Found that LiDAR-based cooperation offers the highest perception performance, communication methods (V2I vs. V2V) perform differently under fusion schemes, error increases lead to more driving violations, and systems lack robustness against communication interference.

Conclusion: The study uncovers critical vulnerabilities in cooperative perception systems and aims to guide improvements in their design and functionality.

Abstract: With the tremendous advancement of deep learning and communication
technology, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception has the
potential to address limitations in sensing distant objects and occlusion for a
single-agent perception system. V2X cooperative perception systems are software
systems characterized by diverse sensor types and cooperative agents, varying
fusion schemes, and operation under different communication conditions.
Therefore, their complex composition gives rise to numerous operational
challenges. Furthermore, when cooperative perception systems produce erroneous
predictions, the types of errors and their underlying causes remain
insufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we take an initial step by
conducting an empirical study of V2X cooperative perception. To systematically
evaluate the impact of cooperative perception on the ego vehicle's perception
performance, we identify and analyze six prevalent error patterns in
cooperative perception systems. We further conduct a systematic evaluation of
the critical components of these systems through our large-scale study and
identify the following key findings: (1) The LiDAR-based cooperation
configuration exhibits the highest perception performance; (2)
Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication
exhibit distinct cooperative perception performance under different fusion
schemes; (3) Increased cooperative perception errors may result in a higher
frequency of driving violations; (4) Cooperative perception systems are not
robust against communication interference when running online. Our results
reveal potential risks and vulnerabilities in critical components of
cooperative perception systems. We hope that our findings can better promote
the design and repair of cooperative perception systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper critiques current methods of teaching small language models (SLMs) via behavioral cloning, focusing instead on transferring structured reasoning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the logical robustness and reasoning capabilities of SLMs by moving away from surface-level behavioral mimicry.

Method: Introduce 'Reasoning Scaffolding,' a framework that abstracts reasoning into interpretable semantic signals used to train models using a multi-task objective.

Result: Their approach significantly improves performance in accuracy and logical consistency on reasoning benchmarks, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Reasoning Scaffolding could be key to developing smaller models with genuine reasoning abilities, rather than mimicking text patterns.

Abstract: The prevailing approach to distilling reasoning from Large Language Models
(LLMs)-behavioral cloning from textual rationales-is fundamentally limited. It
teaches Small Language Models (SLMs) to mimic surface-level patterns rather
than the underlying algorithmic structure of thought, resulting in a critical
lack of logical robustness. We argue that instead of cloning text, distillation
should transfer this algorithmic structure directly. We introduce Reasoning
Scaffolding}, a framework that reframes reasoning as a structured generation
process. Our method first abstracts the teacher's thought process into a
sequence of discrete, interpretable semantic signals (e.g., Contrast, Addition)
that act as a scaffold. The student model is then trained via a multi-task
objective to both (1)predict the next semantic signal, anticipating the
reasoning flow, and (2)generate the corresponding step, conditioned on that
signal. This multi-task scheme acts as a powerful regularizer, compelling the
student to internalize the computational patterns of coherent reasoning. On a
suite of challenging reasoning benchmarks, our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art distillation in both accuracy and logical consistency,
providing a path towards creating smaller models that are genuine reasoners,

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper provides a theory explaining unusual behaviors in RLVR-trained large language models, introduces a novel Annealed-RLVR algorithm, and demonstrates improved performance through structured self-organization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address puzzling behaviors in large language models trained with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) that are poorly explained, such as learning inefficiencies and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: The authors propose a theory linking RLVR behaviors to the self-organization of a persistently sparse semantic network. They introduce "Annealed-RLVR," a novel algorithm incorporating SFT-based "heating" to overcome frustration points in learning.

Result: The Annealed-RLVR algorithm demonstrated improved performance over standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks in experiments involving a 1.5-billion-parameter model.

Conclusion: By framing RLVR as a process of structural self-organization rather than black-box optimization, the paper offers a new physical framework for enhancing reasoning in AI systems and proposes effective algorithmic improvements.

Abstract: Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain
poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, V-shaped
response-length trajectories, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic
forgetting. In this work, we propose that these seemingly disparate phenomena
can be explained using a single unifying theory: the model's reasoning process
maps to the self-organization of a semantic complex network whose topology
remains persistently sparse, with the average degree pinned close to two. This
topology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first
drives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands''
form, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp
growth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by
phase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier. Equipped with the theory,
we propose \textit{Annealed-RLVR}, a principled algorithm that introduces an
SFT-based ``heating'' step at the point of maximal frustration to resolve the
competitive bottleneck and enhance the reasoning capability of the model.
Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter model demonstrate that the approach outperforms
standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks. By
recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of
structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for
engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the GO-AEC framework to improve Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in gaming scenarios, overcoming challenges like jargon, noise, and fast speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General ASR systems perform poorly in gaming environments due to challenges like short phrases, jargon, fast speech, and background noise. Addressing these issues is critical for enhancing communication in multiplayer online games.

Method: The GO-AEC framework utilizes large language models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a novel data augmentation strategy involving LLMs and Text-to-Speech (TTS). It incorporates N-best hypothesis correction and a dynamic game knowledge base.

Result: The GO-AEC framework achieves a 6.22% reduction in character error rate and a 29.71% reduction in sentence error rate, demonstrating significant improvements in ASR accuracy for gaming scenarios.

Conclusion: GO-AEC effectively tackles gaming-specific ASR challenges, showcasing the potential of combining advanced language technologies like LLMs and RAG with focused strategies for gaming environments.

Abstract: With the rise of multiplayer online games, real-time voice communication is
essential for team coordination. However, general ASR systems struggle with
gaming-specific challenges like short phrases, rapid speech, jargon, and noise,
leading to frequent errors. To address this, we propose the GO-AEC framework,
which integrates large language models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
and a data augmentation strategy using LLMs and TTS. GO-AEC includes data
augmentation, N-best hypothesis-based correction, and a dynamic game knowledge
base. Experiments show GO-AEC reduces character error rate by 6.22% and
sentence error rate by 29.71%, significantly improving ASR accuracy in gaming
scenarios.

*Jue Zhang,Qingwei Lin,Saravan Rajmohan,Dongmei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates how reasoning traces in Large Reasoning Models impact answer generation and identifies a functional relationship between reasoning tokens and answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of intermediate reasoning traces in improving answer generation and evaluate how LRMs utilize reasoning tokens.

Method: The paper conducts a three-stage study: empirical evaluation of reasoning's impact on answer quality, attention analysis of reasoning's influence on answer tokens, and mechanistic interventions with activation patching.

Result: Reasoning improves answer quality, attention weights confirm reasoning's influence, and modifications to reasoning activations alter model outputs.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of explicit reasoning in LRMs and shows reasoning tokens play a functional role in shaping answers.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate explicit reasoning traces alongside
final answers, yet the extent to which these traces influence answer generation
remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a three-stage investigation into the
interplay between reasoning and answer generation in three distilled DeepSeek
R1 models. First, through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that including
explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality across diverse domains.
Second, attention analysis reveals that answer tokens attend substantially to
reasoning tokens, with certain mid-layer Reasoning-Focus Heads (RFHs) closely
tracking the reasoning trajectory, including self-reflective cues. Third, we
apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the
dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that
perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers,
confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to
answer. These findings deepen our understanding of how LRMs leverage reasoning
tokens for answer generation, highlighting the functional role of intermediate
reasoning in shaping model outputs. Our data and code are publicly available at

*Jianshuo Dong,Sheng Guo,Hao Wang,Zhuotao Liu,Tianwei Zhang,Ke Xu,Minlie Huang,Han Qiu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates vulnerabilities in LLM-based search agents exposed to unreliable information online and introduces a systematic assessment framework to enhance safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address safety concerns arising from the unreliable search results that can misguide LLM-based agents connected to the Internet.

Method: Two experiments reveal issues with search results, followed by the development of an automatic red-teaming framework and the SafeSearch benchmark to evaluate vulnerabilities in search agents.

Result: The evaluation across various LLMs reveals significant vulnerabilities, with a worst-case attack success rate (ASR) of 90.5% for a specific setup, and common defenses proving ineffective.

Conclusion: The framework provides valuable insights into risks faced by search agents, promoting their safer and more transparent development.

Abstract: Search agents connect LLMs to the Internet, enabling access to broader and
more up-to-date information. However, unreliable search results may also pose
safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work,
we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of
low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To
counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is
systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless
safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct
the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five
categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using
this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds,
covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary
and 8 open-source backend LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities
of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest
ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover,
our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices,
such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in
promoting transparency for safer agent development. Our codebase and test cases

### [61] [Measuring Sparse Autoencoder Feature Sensitivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23717)
*Claire Tian,Katherine Tian,Nathan Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to measure feature sensitivity in Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) architectures, revealing insights about their reliability and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse Autoencoder features are widely used for interpretability, but current methods inadequately address how reliably these features activate in similar contexts.

Method: A scalable approach is proposed to evaluate feature sensitivity using language models to generate semantically similar texts based on a feature's activating examples and test activation on these generated texts.

Result: The study identifies that many interpretable features lack sensitivity, validated by human evaluations, and observes that sensitivity declines as SAE width increases across different variants.

Conclusion: Feature sensitivity is introduced as an essential criterion for assessing individual feature quality and architecture-wide effectiveness in SAEs.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) features have become essential tools for mechanistic
interpretability research. SAE features are typically characterized by
examining their activating examples, which are often "monosemantic" and align
with human interpretable concepts. However, these examples don't reveal feature
sensitivity: how reliably a feature activates on texts similar to its
activating examples. In this work, we develop a scalable method to evaluate
feature sensitivity. Our approach avoids the need to generate natural language
descriptions for features; instead we use language models to generate text with
the same semantic properties as a feature's activating examples. We then test
whether the feature activates on these generated texts. We demonstrate that
sensitivity measures a new facet of feature quality and find that many
interpretable features have poor sensitivity. Human evaluation confirms that
when features fail to activate on our generated text, that text genuinely
resembles the original activating examples. Lastly, we study feature
sensitivity at the SAE level and observe that average feature sensitivity
declines with increasing SAE width across 7 SAE variants. Our work establishes
feature sensitivity as a new dimension for evaluating both individual features
and SAE architectures.

*Siqi Ma,Jiajie Huang,Bolin Yang,Fan Zhang,Jinlin Wu,Yue Shen,Guohui Fan,Zhu Zhang,Zelin Zang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces MedLA, a logic-driven multi-agent framework using large language models to improve medical question-answering with structured reasoning and error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent systems for medical QA lack the ability to detect fine-grained logical inconsistencies due to limited interaction mechanisms and static role assignments.

Method: MedLA employs multiple agents that construct explicit logical trees comprising syllogistic triads. These agents engage in graph-guided discussions to refine logic, correct errors, and resolve contradictions iteratively.

Result: MedLA outperformed static role-based systems and single-agent models in medical diagnosis benchmarks (MedDDx) and standard medical QA tasks.

Conclusion: MedLA offers a scalable and generalizable framework for trustworthy medical reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results with both open-source and commercial LLMs.

Abstract: Answering complex medical questions requires not only domain expertise and
patient-specific information, but also structured and multi-perspective
reasoning. Existing multi-agent approaches often rely on fixed roles or shallow
interaction prompts, limiting their ability to detect and resolve fine-grained
logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose \textsc{MedLA}, a
logic-driven multi-agent framework built on large language models. Each agent
organizes its reasoning process into an explicit logical tree based on
syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion), enabling
transparent inference and premise-level alignment. Agents engage in a
multi-round, graph-guided discussion to compare and iteratively refine their
logic trees, achieving consensus through error correction and contradiction
resolution. We demonstrate that \textsc{MedLA} consistently outperforms both
static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on challenging benchmarks
such as MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks. Furthermore, \textsc{MedLA}
scales effectively across both open-source and commercial LLM backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering a generalizable paradigm
for trustworthy medical reasoning.

*Siyao Song,Cong Ma,Zhihao Cheng,Shiye Lei,Minghao Li,Ying Zeng,Huaixiao Tou,Kai Jia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Expert-Assisted Policy Optimization (EAPO), an RL framework for improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs) using external expert interaction during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in current reinforcement learning approaches for LLMs that rely on sparse, outcome-based rewards, leading to challenges in exploration and reasoning strengthening.

Method: Proposes EAPO, which incorporates multi-turn interactions with external experts during model training, encouraging policies to dynamically decide when to consult experts and thereby enhancing reward feedback and reasoning reliability.

Result: EAPO demonstrated consistently superior performance in mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME 2024, AIME 2025, AIMO 2025), outperforming existing expert-assisted, expert-distilled, and RL baselines, with a notable 5-point improvement over self-exploratory models.

Conclusion: The EAPO framework internalizes expert knowledge, significantly improving the independent reasoning abilities of LLMs, resulting in richer reasoning paths and more accurate solutions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently advanced in reasoning when
optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) under verifiable rewards. Existing
methods primarily rely on outcome-based supervision to strengthen internal LLM
reasoning, often leading to inefficient exploration and sparse rewards. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Expert-Assisted Policy Optimization (EAPO), a
novel RL framework that enhances exploration by incorporating multi-turn
interactions with external experts during training. Unlike prior methods, where
policies reason in isolation, EAPO incentivizes the policy to adaptively
determine when and how to consult experts, yielding richer reward signals and
more reliable reasoning trajectories. External assistance ultimately
internalizes expert knowledge into the policy model, amplifying the model's
inherent reasoning capabilities. During evaluation, the policy model has been
well-optimized to solve questions independently, producing improved reasoning
paths and more accurate solutions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, including AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and AIMO 2025, show that EAPO
consistently outperforms expert-assisted workflow, expert-distilled models, and
RL baselines, with an average gain of 5 points over self-exploratory models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GUI-Shepherd, a Process Reward Model that provides dense feedback for training autonomous agents for long-sequence GUI tasks, addressing challenges in sparse rewards and credit assignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous agents face challenges in performing long-sequence GUI tasks due to sparse rewards and difficulties in assigning credit to specific actions within a sequence.

Method: The authors propose GUI-Shepherd, which leverages a large dataset of 52k interactions (with human-annotated scores and GPT-4-generated rationales) to provide step-by-step dense rewards for reinforcement learning and act as an inference verifier.

Result: GUI-Shepherd improves performance across both the online and offline benchmarks. It achieves a 7.7-point improvement in success rate in the online AndroidWorld benchmark and similar gains in the offline AndroidControl benchmark as both a reward provider and verifier.

Conclusion: High-fidelity process supervision, as provided by GUI-Shepherd, is essential for building better-performing GUI agents. The approach generalizes well across various benchmarks, making it a promising solution.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for long-sequence Graphical User Interface tasks are
hindered by sparse rewards and the intractable credit assignment problem. To
address these challenges, we introduce GUI-Shepherd, a Process Reward Model
that provides dense, step-by-step feedback to guide agents. GUI-Shepherd is
trained on a diverse large-scale data set of $52$k interactions that features
human-annotated scores and GPT-4o generated rationales, enabling it to serve
both as a reward provider for RL training and as a verifier for inference. As
far as we know, we are the first to conduct a systematic study of process
supervision in GUI agents, across diverse settings from online long-horizon
tasks to offline single-step prediction. On the online AndroidWorld benchmark,
GUI-Shepherd improves success rate by $7.7$ points via multi-turn online PPO,
significantly outperforming Outcome Reward Model based competitors. When used
as an inference verifier, it brings $5.1$ points improvements. The benefits
generalize to the offline AndroidControl benchmark, with gains of $2.2$ points
as a reward provider and $4.3$ points as a verifier. Collectively, our results
establish that high-fidelity process supervision is critical for building more
capable GUI agents and present a generalizable solution.

TL;DR: The paper introduces OCEAN, a framework for producing visually grounded, human-understandable explanations in AI using object-centric representations and a multi-agent game-theoretic reasoning process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainable AI often struggles to produce human-understandable explanations, especially in visual domains.

Method: OCEAN combines object-centric representations with a transparent multi-agent reasoning process, trained end-to-end, to generate coherent and discriminative evidence for decision-making.

Result: OCEAN was benchmarked against visual classifiers and explanation tools like GradCAM and LIME, demonstrating competitive performance and superior explanation intuitiveness and trustworthiness in user studies.

Conclusion: OCEAN successfully balances model interpretability and performance, offering a faithful reasoning process that users find more intuitive and trustworthy.

Abstract: A central challenge in explainable AI, particularly in the visual domain, is
producing explanations grounded in human-understandable concepts. To tackle
this, we introduce OCEAN (Object-Centric Explananda via Agent Negotiation), a
novel, inherently interpretable framework built on object-centric
representations and a transparent multi-agent reasoning process. The
game-theoretic reasoning process drives agents to agree on coherent and
discriminative evidence, resulting in a faithful and interpretable
decision-making process. We train OCEAN end-to-end and benchmark it against
standard visual classifiers and popular posthoc explanation tools like GradCAM
and LIME across two diagnostic multi-object datasets. Our results demonstrate
competitive performance with respect to state-of-the-art black-box models with
a faithful reasoning process, which was reflected by our user study, where
participants consistently rated OCEAN's explanations as more intuitive and
trustworthy.

*Cheng Yang,Jiaxuan Lu,Haiyuan Wan,Junchi Yu,Feiwei Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChemMAS, a multi-agent system designed for evidence-based recommendation of chemical reaction conditions, emphasizing explainability and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve chemical reaction condition recommendation by leveraging LLMs for better reasoning and decision-making, while addressing the current lack of explanation in existing models.

Method: ChemMAS employs a multi-agent system with mechanistic grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware debate, and rationale aggregation, making task decisions interpretable and evidence-based.

Result: ChemMAS achieves 20-35% better performance compared to domain-specific baselines and surpasses general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy, providing reliable and explainable rationales.

Conclusion: ChemMAS establishes a new standard for explainable AI in scientific workflows, particularly in chemical reaction recommendation tasks, by offering both high accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: The chemical reaction recommendation is to select proper reaction condition
parameters for chemical reactions, which is pivotal to accelerating chemical
science. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), there is
growing interest in leveraging their reasoning and planning capabilities for
reaction condition recommendation. Despite their success, existing methods
rarely explain the rationale behind the recommended reaction conditions,
limiting their utility in high-stakes scientific workflows. In this work, we
propose ChemMAS, a multi-agent system that reframes condition prediction as an
evidence-based reasoning task. ChemMAS decomposes the task into mechanistic
grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale
aggregation. Each decision is backed by interpretable justifications grounded
in chemical knowledge and retrieved precedents. Experiments show that ChemMAS
achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms
general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy, while offering falsifiable,
human-trustable rationales, which establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI
in scientific discovery.

TL;DR: The paper presents Falcon, a large-scale vision-language safety dataset, and FalconEye, an evaluator trained on it, to enhance harm detection in multimodal large language models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods focus primarily on text-based harm evaluation for LLMs, neglecting the visual component in multimodal models (MLLMs).

Method: The authors created Falcon, a dataset with 57,515 VQA pairs categorized into 13 harm group types, and fine-tuned FalconEye, a specialized evaluator, using this dataset.

Result: FalconEye demonstrated superior accuracy in identifying harmful content compared to existing baselines, tested on Falcon-test, VLGuard, and Beavertail-V benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating visual information is vital for evaluating harmfulness in MLLMs, and FalconEye serves as an effective tool for ensuring safety in multimodal dialogues.

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating the harmfulness of content generated by large
language models (LLMs) have been well studied. However, approaches tailored to
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain underdeveloped and lack depth.
This work highlights the crucial role of visual information in moderating
content in visual question answering (VQA), a dimension often overlooked in
current research. To bridge this gap, we introduce Falcon, a large-scale
vision-language safety dataset containing 57,515 VQA pairs across 13 harm
categories. The dataset provides explicit annotations for harmful attributes
across images, instructions, and responses, thereby facilitating a
comprehensive evaluation of the content generated by MLLMs. In addition, it
includes the relevant harm categories along with explanations supporting the
corresponding judgments. We further propose FalconEye, a specialized evaluator
fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the Falcon dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that FalconEye reliably identifies harmful content in complex and
safety-critical multimodal dialogue scenarios. It outperforms all other
baselines in overall accuracy across our proposed Falcon-test dataset and two
widely-used benchmarks-VLGuard and Beavertail-V, underscoring its potential as
a practical safety auditing tool for MLLMs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Mix-ECom,' a dataset designed to assess e-commerce agents on more complex and mixed types of dialogues and domain rules. It evaluates and highlights current agents' limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing benchmarks in evaluating e-commerce dialogue agents' ability to handle mixed-type dialogues and complex domain rules.

Method: The paper introduces 'Mix-ECom,' a corpus derived from real-world customer-service dialogues with post-processed anonymization and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. It contains 4,799 samples featuring diverse dialogue types and 82 e-commerce rules.

Result: Findings reveal that current e-commerce agents are inadequate in handling complex dialogues due to hallucination issues caused by intricate domain rules.

Conclusion: The dataset (Mix-ECom) offers a novel approach to evaluate and enhance e-commerce agents' performance and will be made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: E-commerce agents contribute greatly to helping users complete their
e-commerce needs. To promote further research and application of e-commerce
agents, benchmarking frameworks are introduced for evaluating LLM agents in the
e-commerce domain. Despite the progress, current benchmarks lack evaluating
agents' capability to handle mixed-type e-commerce dialogue and complex domain
rules. To address the issue, this work first introduces a novel corpus, termed
Mix-ECom, which is constructed based on real-world customer-service dialogues
with post-processing to remove user privacy and add CoT process. Specifically,
Mix-ECom contains 4,799 samples with multiply dialogue types in each e-commerce
dialogue, covering four dialogue types (QA, recommendation, task-oriented
dialogue, and chit-chat), three e-commerce task types (pre-sales, logistics,
after-sales), and 82 e-commerce rules. Furthermore, this work build baselines
on Mix-Ecom and propose a dynamic framework to further improve the performance.
Results show that current e-commerce agents lack sufficient capabilities to
handle e-commerce dialogues, due to the hallucination cased by complex domain
rules. The dataset will be publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dreamer 4, a scalable agent that learns to solve complex tasks through reinforcement learning in a world model, achieving breakthroughs in Minecraft gameplay using offline data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of previous world models that struggled to accurately predict object interactions in complex environments, making them less effective at training intelligent agents in imagination.

Method: Dreamer 4 implements a fast and accurate world model leveraging a shortcut forcing objective and a transformer architecture for efficient inference. It learns behaviors from small amounts of action-conditioned data and extensive unlabeled videos, utilizing reinforcement learning in imagination.

Result: The paper demonstrates that Dreamer 4 outperforms previous world models significantly, achieving tasks like obtaining diamonds in Minecraft from purely offline data. It achieves real-time inference on a single GPU and learns effectively from video data.

Conclusion: Dreamer 4 represents a scalable and promising step toward intelligent agents, as it trains solely in imagination, bypassing environmental interaction challenges. The approach has broader implications for robotics and similar tasks.

Abstract: World models learn general knowledge from videos and simulate experience for
training behaviors in imagination, offering a path towards intelligent agents.
However, previous world models have been unable to accurately predict object
interactions in complex environments. We introduce Dreamer 4, a scalable agent
that learns to solve control tasks by reinforcement learning inside of a fast
and accurate world model. In the complex video game Minecraft, the world model
accurately predicts object interactions and game mechanics, outperforming
previous world models by a large margin. The world model achieves real-time
interactive inference on a single GPU through a shortcut forcing objective and
an efficient transformer architecture. Moreover, the world model learns general
action conditioning from only a small amount of data, allowing it to extract
the majority of its knowledge from diverse unlabeled videos. We propose the
challenge of obtaining diamonds in Minecraft from only offline data, aligning
with practical applications such as robotics where learning from environment
interaction can be unsafe and slow. This task requires choosing sequences of
over 20,000 mouse and keyboard actions from raw pixels. By learning behaviors
in imagination, Dreamer 4 is the first agent to obtain diamonds in Minecraft
purely from offline data, without environment interaction. Our work provides a
scalable recipe for imagination training, marking a step towards intelligent
agents.

*Jingyu Liu,Xiaopeng Wu,Jingquan Peng,Kehan Chen,Chuan Yu,Lizhong Ding,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of reward miscalibration and gradient coupling in reinforcement learning, proposing an actor training method to classify good and bad actions to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle flaws in current reward structures and training methods in reinforcement learning, which can inadvertently reinforce suboptimal actions due to reward miscalibration and gradient coupling.

Method: The authors propose a technique where the actor is trained to classify actions into good and bad categories, thereby separating their respective embeddings and mitigating gradient coupling issues.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively reduces harmful reinforcement of flawed actions while promoting better decision-making in long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: By addressing reward miscalibration and gradient interference, the paper establishes that separating action embeddings improves learning efficiency and agentic performance.

Abstract: Building autonomous agents capable of solving long-horizon, real-world tasks
has garnered significant research interest. But outcome based rewards may cause
reward miscalibration which means it might mistakenly allocate positive reward
to flawed middle steps which is regarded as the key reason making the bad
actions being reinforced during training. However we reveal that outcome based
reward ensures expected negative advantage for those flawed middle steps, which
means the flawed actions should be punished during training. Even accounting
for the ``squeezing effect", the probability mass of good actions should
increase and the actor should gradually get rid of harmful actions. This shows
that flawed actions should be punished during training. We further identify
gradient coupling between similar samples as a key issue in agentic RL, the
input prompt is extremely similar and the output action space is limited,
therefore during training, gradients from well-performing samples can
inadvertently strengthen suboptimal or incorrect actions due to similar input
observation and output actions. We show that with gradient coupling, some
flawed actions might be enhanced. To address this, we propose training the
actor to classify good or bad actions to separate the embedding of good/bad
actions and alleviate the gradient interference, extensive experiments shows
its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the security resilience of GPT-OSS-20B against adversarial attacks through systematic evaluation using Jailbreak Oracle.

Method: Systematic security evaluation using the Jailbreak Oracle tool to identify and analyze failure modes such as Schrodinger's compliance, reasoning procedure mirage, and chain-oriented prompting.

Result: The study identifies several exploitable behaviors and vulnerabilities in GPT-OSS-20B models, suggesting significant security concerns.

Conclusion: The security evaluation underscores the necessity to address identified failure modes to improve robustness and mitigate risks in GPT-OSS models.

Abstract: OpenAI's GPT-OSS family provides open-weight language models with explicit
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and a Harmony prompt format. We summarize an
extensive security evaluation of GPT-OSS-20B that probes the model's behavior

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the correspondence between fibring in modal logics and neural networks, integrating fibring into a framework for logical reasoning within neural models, with applications to Graph Neural Networks and Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between the established fibring framework in modal logics and its application to neural networks, formalizing their correspondence to enable logical expressiveness and reasoning in neural architectures.

Method: The authors formalize the concept of fibred models compatible with fibring in neural networks, thereby deriving non-uniform logical expressiveness results for GNNs, GATs, and Transformer models.

Result: The study establishes the formal correspondence between fibring of modal logics and neural networks, showing its ability to derive logical properties for complex neural architectures like GNNs and Transformers.

Conclusion: This work bridges a theoretical gap, offers a foundation for understanding neural network learning through computational logic, and potentially extends fibring as a practical neurosymbolic reasoning framework in AI.

Abstract: Fibring of modal logics is a well-established formalism for combining
countable families of modal logics into a single fibred language with common
semantics, characterized by fibred models. Inspired by this formalism, fibring
of neural networks was introduced as a neurosymbolic framework for combining
learning and reasoning in neural networks. Fibring of neural networks uses the
(pre-)activations of a trained network to evaluate a fibring function computing
the weights of another network whose outputs are injected back into the
original network. However, the exact correspondence between fibring of neural
networks and fibring of modal logics was never formally established. In this
paper, we close this gap by formalizing the idea of fibred models
\emph{compatible} with fibred neural networks. Using this correspondence, we
then derive non-uniform logical expressiveness results for Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Transformer encoders.
Longer-term, the goal of this paper is to open the way for the use of fibring
as a formalism for interpreting the logical theories learnt by neural networks
with the tools of computational logic.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CANON, a novel Conditional advANtage estimatiON approach, enhances the application of reinforcement learning in reasoning tasks for LLMs by enabling directionless evaluation of training metrics like entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of directional biases and the need for careful hyperparameter tuning in prior methods that shape rewards or advantages in reinforcement learning for reasoning tasks.

Method: CANON regrouped sampled responses into two groups based on whether target metrics (e.g., entropy or response length) are higher or lower in value. The method then identifies trends contributing to better performance through inter-group and intra-group comparisons.

Result: CANON consistently outperformed existing methods across various LLMs on mathematical reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks, as well as improved token efficiency when applied to response length.

Conclusion: CANON is an effective and generalizable approach for introducing metric-driven improvement in reinforcement learning without assuming directional metric preferences, thereby enhancing both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language
models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities on tasks with clear correctness criteria, such as mathematical
reasoning tasks. Several training metrics, such as entropy or response length,
have been observed to correlate with different reasoning behaviors in
reinforcement learning. Prior approaches incorporate such priors through reward
or advantage shaping, which often relies on hand-crafted penalties and
preferences (e.g., higher-is-better or lower-is-better). However, without
careful hyperparameter tuning, these directional priors can be overly biased
and may lead to failure. To this end, we introduce Conditional advANtage
estimatiON (CANON), amplifying the impact of the target metric without
presuming its direction. Specifically, CANON regroups the sampled responses
into two groups based on the higher or lower value of a target metric, measures
which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group
comparison, and identifies the better response within the same group. In
summary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across
three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied
to response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more
favorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off.

*José de la Torre-López,Aurora Ramírez,José Raúl Romero*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an evolutionary machine learning model that helps automate paper selection for systematic literature reviews using interpretable, rule-based classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic literature reviews are time-consuming, and the rise of AI offers opportunities to automate certain tasks, including identifying relevant papers effectively.

Method: The study proposes an evolutionary machine learning approach, \\\"	extbackslash ourmodel\\\", employing grammar-guided genetic programming to create interpretable rule-based classifiers that integrate both textual and bibliometric data.

Result: The proposed model successfully generates accurate and interpretable classifiers by incorporating diverse information sources beyond traditional textual data.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates potential in automating paper selection with increased accuracy and flexibility, offering a significant efficiency boost for systematic reviews.

Abstract: Searching, filtering and analysing scientific literature are time-consuming
tasks when performing a systematic literature review. With the rise of
artificial intelligence, some steps in the review process are progressively
being automated. In particular, machine learning for automatic paper selection
can greatly reduce the effort required to identify relevant literature in
scientific databases. We propose an evolutionary machine learning approach,
called \ourmodel, to automatically determine whether a paper retrieved from a
literature search process is relevant. \ourmodel builds an interpretable
rule-based classifier using grammar-guided genetic programming. The use of a
grammar to define the syntax and the structure of the rules allows \ourmodel to
easily combine the usual textual information with other bibliometric data not
considered by state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments demonstrate that it is
possible to generate accurate classifiers without impairing interpretability
and using configurable information sources not supported so far.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TusoAI, an agentic AI system designed to automate the development and optimization of computational methods for scientific tasks, outperforming various benchmarks and uncovering novel biological insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the slow and costly manual process of developing computational tools for analyzing complex experimental data and to leverage the potential of large language models for accelerating scientific discovery.

Method: TusoAI uses a knowledge tree representation to integrate domain knowledge and performs iterative optimization and model diagnosis. It evaluates task descriptions autonomously to develop and refine computational methods.

Result: TusoAI outperformed state-of-the-art methods, machine learning engineers (MLE) agents, and scientific AI agents in benchmarks, while uncovering novel biological insights, such as autoimmune disease associations and genetic links.

Conclusion: TusoAI demonstrates the potential to automate and significantly enhance computational method development in scientific domains, offering improvements in performance and novel discoveries.

Abstract: Scientific discovery is often slowed by the manual development of
computational tools needed to analyze complex experimental data. Building such
tools is costly and time-consuming because scientists must iteratively review
literature, test modeling and scientific assumptions against empirical data,
and implement these insights into efficient software. Large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing literature,
reasoning with empirical data, and generating domain-specific code, offering
new opportunities to accelerate computational method development. Existing
LLM-based systems either focus on performing scientific analyses using existing
computational methods or on developing computational methods or models for
general machine learning without effectively integrating the often unstructured
knowledge specific to scientific domains. Here, we introduce TusoAI , an
agentic AI system that takes a scientific task description with an evaluation
function and autonomously develops and optimizes computational methods for the
application. TusoAI integrates domain knowledge into a knowledge tree
representation and performs iterative, domain-specific optimization and model
diagnosis, improving performance over a pool of candidate solutions. We
conducted comprehensive benchmark evaluations demonstrating that TusoAI
outperforms state-of-the-art expert methods, MLE agents, and scientific AI
agents across diverse tasks, such as single-cell RNA-seq data denoising and
satellite-based earth monitoring. Applying TusoAI to two key open problems in
genetics improved existing computational methods and uncovered novel biology,
including 9 new associations between autoimmune diseases and T cell subtypes
and 7 previously unreported links between disease variants linked to their
target genes. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: To explore how large language models (LLMs) and agent techniques improve data analysis capabilities compared to traditional methods, and to articulate design goals for intelligent data analysis agents.

Method: The paper reviews LLM-based techniques across four data types (structured, semi-structured, unstructured, and heterogeneous) and identifies design goals and challenges for LLM-powered data analysis.

Result: The review highlights key advancements in data comprehension, natural language interfaces, and tool-based workflows enabled by LLMs, catering to diverse data modalities.

Conclusion: LLMs and agents reveal significant potential for intelligent data analysis but face challenges, and the study suggests paths forward to refine capabilities for open-world tasks and multimodal data.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) and agent techniques for data analysis (a.k.a
LLM/Agent-as-Data-Analyst) have demonstrated substantial impact in both
academica and industry. In comparison with traditional rule or small-model
based approaches, (agentic) LLMs enable complex data understanding, natural
language interfaces, semantic analysis functions, and autonomous pipeline
orchestration. The technical evolution further distills five key design goals
for intelligent data analysis agents, namely semantic-aware design,
modality-hybrid integration, autonomous pipelines, tool-augmented workflows,
and support for open-world tasks. From a modality perspective, we review
LLM-based techniques for (i) structured data (e.g., table question answering
for relational data and NL2GQL for graph data), (ii) semi-structured data
(e.g., markup languages understanding and semi-structured table modeling),
(iii) unstructured data (e.g., chart understanding, document understanding,
programming languages vulnerable detection), and (iv) heterogeneous data (e.g.,
data retrieval and modality alignment for data lakes). Finally, we outline the
remaining challenges and propose several insights and practical directions for
advancing LLM/Agent-powered data analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines the reliability of single stochastic runs in leaderboard evaluations for LLMs, revealing their instability and advocating for multiple repetitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leaderboards for LLMs often rely on single-run evaluations, but their reliability is questionable; the motivation is to understand how many repetitions are needed for robust conclusions.

Method: Three independent runs per model setting were evaluated using statistical analyses, including mixed-effects logistic regression and rank-instability analysis.

Result: Findings show significant instabilities in single-run evaluations, with 83% of test cases flipping ranks. Using two repetitions removes 83% of rank inversions.

Conclusion: To improve robustness and align better with real-world reliability, the paper advises at least two repetitions under stochastic settings, while ensuring cost feasibility for small teams.

Abstract: LLM leaderboards often rely on single stochastic runs, but how many
repetitions are required for reliable conclusions remains unclear. We
re-evaluate eight state-of-the-art models on the AI4Math Benchmark with three
independent runs per setting. Using mixed-effects logistic regression,
domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run
reliability, we assessed the value of additional repetitions. Our findings
shows that Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 10/12 slices (83\%) invert at
least one pairwise rank relative to the three-run majority, despite a zero
sign-flip rate for pairwise significance and moderate overall interclass
correlation. Averaging runs yields modest SE shrinkage ($\sim$5\% from one to
three) but large ranking gains; two runs remove $\sim$83\% of single-run
inversions. We provide cost-aware guidance for practitioners: treat evaluation
as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use $\geq 2$ repetitions under
stochastic decoding. These practices improve robustness while remaining
feasible for small teams and help align model comparisons with real-world
reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve agentic applications in complex, open-ended information-seeking tasks by creating a robust and efficient system for evidence-based web searching and multi-turn reasoning.

Method: The paper presents Fathom-DeepResearch, which includes two models: Fathom-Search-4B (for evidence-based live web searches) trained using DUETQA, RAPO, and steerable step-level rewards, and Fathom-Synthesizer-4B (for synthesizing search results into structured research reports).

Result: The system achieves state-of-the-art performance on DeepSearch benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization to diverse reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Fathom-DeepResearch sets a new standard in open-weight agentic systems by advancing tool-dependent reasoning and structured synthesis, proving its efficacy across diverse information-seeking challenges.

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning has emerged as a key focus for enabling agentic
applications. Among these, DeepResearch Agents have gained significant
attention for their strong performance on complex, open-ended
information-seeking tasks. We introduce Fathom-DeepResearch, an agentic system
composed of two specialized models. The first is Fathom-Search-4B, a DeepSearch
model trained from Qwen3-4B and optimized for evidence-based investigation
through live web search and targeted webpage querying. Its training combines
three advances: (i) DUETQA, a 5K-sample dataset generated via multi-agent
self-play that enforces strict web-search dependence and heterogeneous source
grounding; (ii) RAPO, a zero-overhead extension of GRPO that stabilizes
multi-turn Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards through curriculum
pruning, reward-aware advantage scaling, and per-prompt replay buffers; and
(iii) a steerable step-level reward that classifies each tool call by cognitive
behavior and marginal utility, enabling explicit control over search trajectory
breadth, depth, and horizon. These improvements enable reliable extension of
tool-calling beyond 20 calls when warranted. The second is
Fathom-Synthesizer-4B, trained from Qwen3-4B, which converts multi-turn
DeepSearch traces into structured, citation-dense DeepResearch Reports for
comprehensive synthesis. Evaluated on DeepSearch benchmarks (SimpleQA, FRAMES,
WebWalker, Seal0, MuSiQue) and DeepResearch-Bench, the system achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the open-weights category while demonstrating
strong generalization to diverse reasoning tasks including HLE, AIME-25,
GPQA-Diamond, and MedQA.

Motivation: To bridge the gap between natural language interfaces and enterprise-grade data warehouses while addressing challenges in accessibility, interpretability, and maintainability.

Method: Developing a modular architecture with multi-layered reasoning, automated evaluation tools, and statistical reasoning mechanisms to ensure transparent and reliable performance.

Result: The proposed system was tested in insurance claims processing, demonstrating its ability to deliver secure data analysis, apply business rules, and justify decisions with human-auditable transparency.

Conclusion: The architecture provides a robust framework for deploying conversational AI agents in sensitive domains, ensuring trustworthiness through modular design and evaluation mechanisms.

Abstract: This article presents a modular, component-based architecture for developing
and evaluating AI agents that bridge the gap between natural language
interfaces and complex enterprise data warehouses. The system directly
addresses core challenges in data accessibility by enabling non-technical users
to interact with complex data warehouses through a conversational interface,
translating ambiguous user intent into precise, executable database queries to
overcome semantic gaps. A cornerstone of the design is its commitment to
transparent decision-making, achieved through a multi-layered reasoning
framework that explains the "why" behind every decision, allowing for full
interpretability by tracing conclusions through specific, activated business
rules and data points. The architecture integrates a robust quality assurance
mechanism via an automated evaluation framework that serves multiple functions:
it enables performance benchmarking by objectively measuring agent performance
against golden standards, and it ensures system reliability by automating the
detection of performance regressions during updates. The agent's analytical
depth is enhanced by a statistical context module, which quantifies deviations
from normative behavior, ensuring all conclusions are supported by quantitative
evidence including concrete data, percentages, and statistical comparisons. We
demonstrate the efficacy of this integrated agent-development-with-evaluation
framework through a case study on an insurance claims processing system. The
agent, built on a modular architecture, leverages the BigQuery ecosystem to
perform secure data retrieval, apply domain-specific business rules, and
generate human-auditable justifications. The results confirm that this approach
creates a robust, evaluable, and trustworthy system for deploying LLM-powered
agents in data-sensitive, high-stakes domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies a flaw in large reasoning models (LRMs) where answers often contradict reasoning traces due to competition between memory retrieval and reasoning mechanisms. It introduces FARL, a fine-tuning framework to overcome this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistencies in LRMs' answers, as they sometimes contradict their reasoning traces due to competing answer-generation mechanisms.

Method: The authors conduct controlled experiments with misleading cues and corrupted answers to analyze the interaction between reasoning and retrieval mechanisms. They propose a fine-tuning framework called FARL that combines memory unlearning and reinforcement learning.

Result: The experiments confirm the simultaneous operation of retrieval and reasoning mechanisms, with varying dominance across problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning methods. FARL mitigates shortcut exploitation and promotes reasoning-dominant behavior.

Conclusion: FARL helps LRMs reduce reliance on retrieval shortcuts and enhances their reasoning capabilities, addressing a critical limitation in existing fine-tuning paradigms.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving
complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent
studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning
traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing
mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test
this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with
misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our
results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate
simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors:
problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement
learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in
current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval
mechanism as a shortcut, effectively "hacking" the reward signal and
undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we
introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning
with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts
during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and
enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.

### [83] [Robust Preference Optimization: Aligning Language Models with Noisy Preference Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24159)
*Xiaoyang Cao,Zelai Xu,Mo Guang,Kaiwen Long,Michiel A. Bakker,Yu Wang,Chao Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies flaws in conventional human preference-based alignment methods for LLMs and proposes Robust Preference Optimization (RPO), a meta-framework to handle noisy and pluralistic human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard alignment methods assume homogeneous preferences and noiseless data, which does not represent the reality of pluralistic human preferences and potential annotation errors.

Method: RPO applies an Expectation-Maximization algorithm to infer the correctness of labels, adjusting their weights in training, and provides a theoretical framework to convert existing alignment algorithms into robust forms.

Result: RPO consistently improved the performance of four alignment algorithms (DPO, IPO, SimPO, and CPO) on Llama 3 and Mistral models, showing up to 7.0% gain in win rates in evaluations.

Conclusion: RPO not only addresses noise and pluralism in preference data but establishes itself as a generalizable framework for enhancing alignment algorithms, benefiting LLMs wherever robust preference data handling is needed.

Abstract: Standard human preference-based alignment methods, such as Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are a cornerstone technology for aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, these methods are all
underpinned by a critical, yet flawed assumption: human preferences are
homogeneous (representing a single, unified preference) and the collected data
is noiseless (free from error). In reality, neither is true since human
preference is pluralistic and annotators can make mistakes. This creates a
discrepancy between the recorded data and the ground-truth preferences, which
can misguide the model and degrade its performance. To address this challenge,
we introduce Robust Preference Optimization (RPO). RPO employs an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the posterior probability of
each label's correctness, which is used to adaptively re-weigh each data point
in the training loss to mitigate noise. We further generalize this approach by
establishing a theoretical link between arbitrary preference losses and their
corresponding probabilistic models. This generalization enables the systematic
transformation of existing alignment algorithms into their robust counterparts,
elevating RPO from a specific algorithm to a meta-framework for robust
preference alignment. Theoretically, we prove that under the condition of a
perfectly calibrated model, RPO is guaranteed to converge to the true noise
level of the dataset. Our experiments demonstrate RPO's effectiveness as a
meta-framework, consistently enhancing four state-of-the-art alignment
algorithms (DPO, IPO, SimPO, and CPO). When applied to Mistral and Llama 3
models, the RPO-enhanced methods achieve substantial win rate gains on
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, with improvements of up to 7.0% and 5.4%,
respectively.

*Sijia Liu,Niklas Muennighoff,Kawin Ethayarajh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the advantage of online alignment over offline alignment methods and attributes it to human-centric perceptual biases, proposing a design pattern to mimic this for better training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand why online alignment methods like GRPO perform better than offline methods such as DPO and to explore ways to improve training efficiency without performance loss.

Method: The paper draws on behavioral economics, specifically prospect theory, to explain how human perception biases are accounted for in online methods. It introduces design patterns that incorporate perceptual distortions into existing algorithms, allowing for offline training that mimics human perception.

Result: Humanline variants of alignment algorithms were created, and experiments showed that these offline-trained variants matched the performance of online methods on various tasks.

Conclusion: The study shows that the advantage of online alignment lies in accounting for human perceptual biases. By explicitly incorporating these biases, offline training can achieve similar performance while being more efficient and flexible.

Abstract: Online alignment (e.g., GRPO) is generally more performant than offline
alignment (e.g., DPO) -- but why? Drawing on prospect theory from behavioral
economics, we propose a human-centric explanation. We prove that online
on-policy sampling better approximates the human-perceived distribution of what
the model can produce, and PPO/GRPO-style clipping -- originally introduced to
just stabilize training -- recovers a perceptual bias in how humans perceive
probability. In this sense, PPO/GRPO act as perceptual losses already. Our
theory further suggests that the online/offline dichotomy is itself incidental
to maximizing human utility, since we can achieve the same effect by
selectively training on any data in a manner that mimics human perception,
rather than restricting ourselves to online on-policy data. Doing so would
allow us to post-train more quickly, cheaply, and flexibly without sacrificing
performance. To this end, we propose a design pattern that explicitly
incorporates perceptual distortions of probability into objectives like
DPO/KTO/GRPO, creating humanline variants of them. Surprisingly, we find that
these humanline variants, even when trained with offline off-policy data, can
match the performance of their online counterparts on both verifiable and
unverifiable tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ELHPlan, a new framework for efficient LLM-based multi-robot collaboration using intention-bound Action Chains, achieving reduced token consumption while maintaining task success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-offs faced by LLM-based multi-robot collaboration, balancing adaptability in dynamic settings and computational efficiency in large teams.

Method: ELHPlan employs cyclical planning: creating intention-bound action sequences, validating conflicts, refining issues, and executing validated actions. Efficiency metrics like token use and planning time are introduced.

Result: ELHPlan reduces token consumption to 24% of traditional methods while achieving comparable success rates in benchmark tests.

Conclusion: ELHPlan sets a new benchmark for efficiency and effectiveness in LLM-based multi-agent planning systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable intelligent multi-robot collaboration but
face fundamental trade-offs: declarative methods lack adaptability in dynamic
environments, while iterative methods incur prohibitive computational costs
that scale poorly with team size and task complexity. In this paper, we propose
ELHPlan, a novel framework that introduces Action Chains--sequences of actions
explicitly bound to sub-goal intentions--as the fundamental planning primitive.
ELHPlan operates via a cyclical process: 1) constructing intention-bound action
sequences, 2) proactively validating for conflicts and feasibility, 3) refining
issues through targeted mechanisms, and 4) executing validated actions. This
design balances adaptability and efficiency by providing sufficient planning
horizons while avoiding expensive full re-planning. We further propose
comprehensive efficiency metrics, including token consumption and planning
time, to more holistically evaluate multi-agent collaboration. Our experiments
on benchmark TDW-MAT and C-WAH demonstrate that ELHPlan achieves comparable
task success rates while consuming only 24% of the tokens required by
state-of-the-art methods. Our research establishes a new
efficiency-effectiveness frontier for LLM-based multi-agent planning systems.

*Yixin He,Lumingyuan Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FR-Ponder is a framework for optimizing computational effort during reasoning by large language models (LLMs) using adaptive steering to match problem complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for reasoning with LLMs unnecessarily apply uniform computational effort across problems, leading to inefficiencies and poor performance on complex tasks.

Method: FR-Ponder uses a lightweight controller to analyze hidden states and adaptively allocate reasoning steps by adding pre-computed steering vectors to frozen representations, leveraging curriculum learning and reward signals.

Result: On GSM8K and MATH500, FR-Ponder achieves better task accuracy with reduced computational effort and learns interpretable compute allocation correlated with input complexity.

Conclusion: FR-Ponder effectively balances computation and accuracy, improving efficiency without modifying the backbone model, paving the way for adaptive reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a key paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning,
yet prevailing approaches like Best-of-N and majority voting apply uniform
depth across inputs, wasting computation on simple queries while potentially
under-thinking complex ones. We present FR-Ponder, a single-graph,
backbone-training-free framework that allocates instance-adaptive reasoning
compute via latent steering. A less than 1M-param controller observes hidden
states and decides to halt or apply a small ponder step by adding a
pre-computed steering vector to frozen representations. Our method extracts the
latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning outputs and direct IO
from LLM and re-applies it through a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to adapt its reasoning depth to the complexity of each input. To balance
performance and computational cost, we employ Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) as a reward signal to adaptively regulate reasoning depth,
achieving task accuracy while mitigating overreasoning. Through curriculum
learning and careful reward engineering, FR-Ponder learns calibrated compute
allocation correlated with problem difficulty. On GSM8K and MATH500, FR-Ponder
improves the compute-accuracy frontier, delivering lower FLOPs with better
matched accuracy and comparing favorably to early-exit baselines, without
modifying backbone weights. Analyses visualize interpretable steering
directions and show learned compute allocation correlates with problem
difficulty.

### [87] [Model Merging Scaling Laws in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24244)
*Yuanyi Wang,Yanggan Gu,Yiming Zhang,Qi Zhou,Zhaoyi Yan,Congkai Xie,Xinyao Wang,Jianbo Yuan,Hongxia Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper identifies a power-law relationship in language model merging, demonstrating predictable scaling behaviors based on model size and expert number.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to establish quantitative rules for language model merging, which currently lacks predictive guidelines despite its widespread use.

Method: The authors propose and validate a compact power law that relates model size and expert number, analyzing its validity across architectures and methods, while also deriving a theory explaining the scaling behavior.

Result: The study finds that gains follow a predictable 1/k pattern, with clear diminishing returns in expert number and greater efficiency through informed planning of merging strategies.

Conclusion: This work offers a new scaling principle for distributed generative AI, transforming merging into a predictable, efficient method and providing an alternative to multitask training for advancing AI system capabilities.

Abstract: We study empirical scaling laws for language model merging measured by
cross-entropy. Despite its wide practical use, merging lacks a quantitative
rule that predicts returns as we add experts or scale the model size. We
identify a compact power law that links model size and expert number: the
size-dependent floor decreases with model capacity, while the merging tail
exhibits clear diminishing returns in the number of experts. The law holds
in-domain and cross-domain, tightly fits measured curves across diverse
architectures and methods (Average, TA, TIES, DARE), and explains two robust
regularities: most gains arrive early, and variability shrinks as more experts
are included. Building on this, we present a simple theory that explains why
gains fall roughly as 1/k and links the floor and tail to properties of the
base model and the diversity across domains. This law enables predictive
planning: estimate how many experts are needed to reach a target loss, decide
when to stop adding experts, and trade off scaling the base model versus adding
experts under a fixed budget--turning merging from heuristic practice into a
computationally efficient, planable alternative to multitask training. This
suggests a scaling principle for distributed generative AI: predictable gains
can be achieved by composing specialists, offering a complementary path toward
AGI-level systems.

### [88] [SpecExit: Accelerating Large Reasoning Model via Speculative Exit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24248)
*Rubing Yang,Huajun Bai,Song Liu,Guanghua Yu,Runzhi Fan,Yanbin Dang,Jiejing Zhang,Kai Liu,Jianchen Zhu,Peng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper tackles overthinking in large reasoning models by proposing SpecExit, a framework utilizing hidden states to exit reasoning early, reducing latency and output length while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency of large reasoning models, which often produce excessively lengthy outputs and suffer from high latency, hindering their deployment.

Method: SpecExit uses a lightweight draft model to predict tokens and early-exit signals directly from hidden states, eliminating probing mechanisms and associated overhead.

Result: SpecExit achieves a 66% reduction in average generation length and a 2.5x improvement in end-to-end latency compared to speculative decoding baselines, with minimal accuracy trade-off.

Conclusion: SpecExit demonstrates that leveraging hidden states can effectively streamline reasoning in models, paving the way for broader applications in efficient reasoning systems.

Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models
(LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and
incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world
deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed
to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach
can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy.
However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead
that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their
generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states
in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts
both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft
model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements,
reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in
end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without
compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden
states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of
hidden states for efficient reasoning. Our code is available at

### [89] [Interactive Program Synthesis for Modeling Collaborative Physical Activities from Narrated Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24250)
*Edward Kim,Daniel He,Jorge Chao,Wiktor Rajca,Mohammed Amin,Nishant Malpani,Ruta Desai,Antti Oulasvirta,Bjoern Hartmann,Sanjit Seshia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores teaching systems collaborative physical tasks using program synthesis and narrated demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable teaching systems collaborative physical tasks, which involve understanding users' assumptions about teammates' intent.

Method: Uses program synthesis and narrated demonstrations (paired physical actions and natural language) to teach, inspect, and correct system behavior.

Result: In a study with 20 users teaching soccer tactics, 70% refined system-learned programs effectively, and 90% found correction processes easy.

Conclusion: The study highlights unique challenges in representing learning as programs and teaching collaborative tasks, proposing strategies to address them.

Abstract: Teaching systems physical tasks is a long standing goal in HCI, yet most
prior work has focused on non collaborative physical activities. Collaborative
tasks introduce added complexity, requiring systems to infer users assumptions
about their teammates intent, which is an inherently ambiguous and dynamic
process. This necessitates representations that are interpretable and
correctable, enabling users to inspect and refine system behavior. We address
this challenge by framing collaborative task learning as a program synthesis
problem. Our system represents behavior as editable programs and uses narrated
demonstrations, i.e. paired physical actions and natural language, as a unified
modality for teaching, inspecting, and correcting system logic without
requiring users to see or write code. The same modality is used for the system
to communicate its learning to users. In a within subjects study, 20 users
taught multiplayer soccer tactics to our system. 70 percent (14/20) of
participants successfully refined learned programs to match their intent and 90
percent (18/20) found it easy to correct the programs. The study surfaced
unique challenges in representing learning as programs and in enabling users to
teach collaborative physical activities. We discuss these issues and outline
mitigation strategies.

### [90] [Rethinking and Benchmarking Large Language Models for Graph Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24260)
*Yuwei Hu,Xinyi Huang,Zhewei Wei,Yongchao Liu,Chuntao Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of current practices in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) for graph reasoning tasks. It evaluates base models and proposes a new benchmark and method to better assess and enhance their capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify limitations in existing methods and benchmarks for enabling LLMs to handle graph reasoning problems and to improve their performance and evaluation.

Method: A new benchmark called GraphAlgorithm is introduced, which includes 239 graph problems and 3,041 test instances from competitions. The paper also proposes a baseline method, Simple-RTC, which focuses LLM reasoning on designing algorithms first, followed by coding.

Result: Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing benchmarks and outperforms other methods on the new GraphAlgorithm benchmark. It also shows that underperforming base models like GPT-4o-mini can excel with a better reasoning focus.

Conclusion: The study redefines the direction for LLMs in graph reasoning by creating a challenging benchmark and a strong baseline, encouraging further advancements in this field.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for Graph Reasoning have been extensively
studied over the past two years, involving enabling LLMs to understand graph
structures and reason on graphs to solve various graph problems, with graph
algorithm problems being the most prevalent. Recent studies underscore the
potential of LLMs in handling graph reasoning tasks, but their performance is
underwhelming. In this work, we point out issues with existing methods and
benchmarks, and rethink the direction that LLMs for graph reasoning should
strive toward. We find that base models, e.g., GPT-4o-mini, are largely
underestimated due to improper reasoning focus. Base models with reasoning
focus redirected from replicating graph algorithms to designing them can easily
solve most graph reasoning tasks in existing benchmarks. To truly evaluate the
graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we construct a more challenging
GraphAlgorithm benchmark, comprising 239 different graph problems and 3,041
test instances collected from 4 competition platforms. Finally, we introduce a
simple and strong baseline Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC)-which
guides LLMs to design graph algorithms first and then code to address graph
reasoning tasks. Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing
benchmarks and significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini and all prior methods on
the GraphAlgorithm benchmark. This strong baseline encourages further
advancements in LLMs for Graph Reasoning in the future.

### [91] [Risk-Sensitive RL for Alleviating Exploration Dilemmas in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24261)
*Yuhua Jiang,Jiawei Huang,Yufeng Yuan,Xin Mao,Yu Yue,Qianchuan Zhao,Lin Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the exploration problem in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing reasoning in LLMs, proposing a Risk-Sensitive RL framework with the RS-GRPO algorithm to achieve better exploration and improved reasoning diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the exploration dilemma in RLVR, where pre-trained LLMs' sharply peaked initial policies restrict standard RL algorithms to a narrow solution space, resulting in limited diversity and multi-solution effectiveness.

Method: The authors introduce a Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning framework, which uses a risk-seeking objective that interpolates between mean and maximum rewards. They propose a novel algorithm, Risk-Sensitive GRPO (RS-GRPO), to enhance exploration and learning from challenging prompts.

Result: On six mathematical reasoning benchmarks and with five different LLMs, the RS-GRPO algorithm consistently improves multi-solution performance (pass@k) while maintaining or enhancing single-solution accuracy (pass@1).

Conclusion: RS-GRPO successfully addresses the exploration limitations of RLVR, enriching solution diversity and demonstrating effectiveness across various benchmarks and models with minimal implementation effort.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective
for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However,
existing methods suffer from an exploration dilemma: the sharply peaked initial
policies of pre-trained LLMs confine standard RL algorithms to a narrow set of
solutions, boosting single-solution accuracy (pass@1) but suppressing solution
diversity and multi-solution performance (pass@k). As a result, RLVR often
distills existing capabilities rather than discovering new reasoning
strategies. To overcome this, we introduce a Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement
Learning framework. Our approach employs a risk-seeking objective that
interpolates between mean and maximum rewards, leading to a novel algorithm,
Risk-Sensitive GRPO (RS-GRPO), which drives deeper exploration by amplifying
learning from challenging prompts. Remarkably, RS-GRPO is simple to implement,
requiring only minor code modifications. On six mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and with five different LLMs, RS-GRPO consistently improves pass@k
performance while maintaining or enhancing pass@1 accuracy.

TL;DR: This paper introduces PAME-AI, a novel AI system that enhances patient messaging design for healthcare by using a structured computational approach, achieving significant improvements in message engagement rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare communication often struggles with limitations in traditional mobile message design, particularly in exploring complex design spaces to improve engagement and outcomes.

Method: The paper develops PAME-AI, an Agentic AI system based on the DIKW hierarchy. It uses specialized computational agents to refine raw data into optimized message strategies through a structured framework.

Result: Experiments involving over 500,000 patient encounters showed a top-performing message achieving a 68.76% engagement rate, a 12.2% improvement over the baseline of 61.27%.

Conclusion: PAME-AI effectively improves healthcare communication by utilizing structured AI methods to optimize patient messaging, demonstrating scalability and adaptability for large-scale healthcare applications.

Abstract: Messaging patients is a critical part of healthcare communication, helping to
improve things like medication adherence and healthy behaviors. However,
traditional mobile message design has significant limitations due to its
inability to explore the high-dimensional design space. We develop PAME-AI, a
novel approach for Patient Messaging Creation and Optimization using Agentic
AI. Built on the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy, PAME-AI
offers a structured framework to move from raw data to actionable insights for
high-performance messaging design. PAME-AI is composed of a system of
specialized computational agents that progressively transform raw experimental
data into actionable message design strategies. We demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness through a two-stage experiment, comprising of 444,691 patient
encounters in Stage 1 and 74,908 in Stage 2. The best-performing generated
message achieved 68.76% engagement compared to the 61.27% baseline,
representing a 12.2\% relative improvement in click-through rates. This agentic
architecture enables parallel processing, hypothesis validation, and continuous
learning, making it particularly suitable for large-scale healthcare
communication optimization.

### [93] [AdvChain: Adversarial Chain-of-Thought Tuning for Robust Safety Alignment of Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24269)
*Zihao Zhu,Xinyu Wu,Gehan Hu,Siwei Lyu,Ke Xu,Baoyuan Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces AdvChain, a method to improve the safety and reliability of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by enabling dynamic self-correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional safety tuning for LRMs in CoT reasoning struggles with the 'snowball effect,' where small reasoning errors progressively worsen. Current methods fail because models focus on imitating perfect reasoning rather than learning to self-correct.

Method: AdvChain is proposed as a new alignment paradigm using adversarial CoT tuning. It builds datasets with Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples to teach models how to recover from harmful reasoning deviations and unnecessary caution.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that AdvChain improves model robustness against jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while reducing over-refusal on benign prompts, ensuring a better safety-utility tradeoff.

Conclusion: The study presents AdvChain as an effective approach to mitigating critical safety issues in CoT reasoning, guiding the development of more robust and reliable reasoning models.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex problem-solving through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the
multi-step nature of CoT introduces new safety challenges that extend beyond
conventional language model alignment. We identify a failure mode in current
safety CoT tuning methods: the \textit{snowball effect}, where minor reasoning
deviations progressively amplify throughout the thought process, leading to
either harmful compliance or excessive refusal. This effect stems from models
being trained to imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to
self-correct. To address this limitation, we propose AdvChain, an alignment
paradigm that teaches models dynamic self-correction through adversarial CoT
tuning. Our method involves constructing a dataset containing
Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, where models learn to
recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions. Extensive
experiments show that AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against
jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal
on benign prompts, achieving a superior safety-utility balance without
compromising reasoning capabilities. Our work establishes a new direction for
building more robust and reliable reasoning models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces G-reasoner, a framework combining graph and language models to improve reasoning on graph-structured knowledge, achieving superior performance and efficiency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods struggle with reasoning on graph-structured knowledge, relying on fragmented data and weak modeling approaches.

Method: The authors propose QuadGraph, a unified graph abstraction for heterogeneous knowledge, and develop a graph foundation model (GFM) that combines graph topology with textual semantics, integrated into LLMs.

Result: Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, enhances reasoning efficiency, and generalizes better across diverse graphs.

Conclusion: G-reasoner establishes a scalable and effective framework for reasoning with graph-structured knowledge, showcasing improved capability and efficiency on knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but remain limited by
static and incomplete parametric knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, yet existing RAGs
struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak
modeling of knowledge structure. Graphs offer a natural way to model
relationships within knowledge, but LLMs are inherently unstructured and cannot
effectively reason over graph-structured data. Recent graph-enhanced RAG
(GraphRAG) attempts to bridge this gap by constructing tailored graphs and
enabling LLMs to reason on them. However, these methods often depend on ad-hoc
graph designs, heuristic search, or costly agent pipelines, which hinder
scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we present
G-reasoner, a unified framework that integrates graph and language foundation
models for reasoning over diverse graph-structured knowledge. Central to our
approach is QuadGraph, a standardized four-layer abstraction that unifies
heterogeneous knowledge sources into a common graph representation. Building on
this, we introduce a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that jointly
captures graph topology and textual semantics, and is integrated with LLMs to
enhance reasoning in downstream applications. To ensure scalability and
efficiency, mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing are
implemented to scale GFM with more GPUs. Extensive experiments on six
benchmarks show that G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency
and cross-graph generalization.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of answer verification for large language models (LLMs) in scientific reasoning by introducing a cross-disciplinary benchmark, SCI-VerifyBench, and a reasoning-augmented model, SCI-Verifier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With LLMs increasingly used in scientific reasoning, verifying answers is complicated by diverse equivalent expressions and complex formats. Existing solutions lack evaluation standards and generalizability across domains.

Method: The researchers created SCI-VerifyBench, a benchmark covering diverse scientific disciplines and LLM responses, incorporating equivalence transformations and expert annotations. They also developed SCI-Verifier, a unified, reasoning-augmented model trained for logical reasoning and equivalence judgment.

Result: SCI-Verifier demonstrated strong performance in reasoning and verification tasks, while SCI-VerifyBench allowed for systematic evaluation across disciplines.

Conclusion: The combined framework of SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provides a systematic approach for improving answer verification and advancing the reliability of LLMs in scientific applications.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent
expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing
verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations:
(a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient
disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b)
heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces
their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their
cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct
SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics,
biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real
LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations
that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert
annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of
verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of
reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified
reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training,
SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment
capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together,
SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific
verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to
enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedMMV is introduced as a controllable multimodal multi-agent framework for clinical reasoning that addresses instability and hallucination in diagnostic AI models. It stabilizes reasoning through diversified short rollouts, evidence graph grounding, and uncertainty scoring, achieving higher accuracy and reliability on medical benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address instability and hallucination in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that can lead to inconsistent conclusions during clinical reasoning. This is critical for ensuring trustworthy AI systems in medical decision support.

Method: MedMMV employs a multi-agent framework with diversified short rollouts, structured evidence graphs supervised by a Hallucination Detector, and aggregated reasoning paths scored by a Combined Uncertainty metric. This approach aims to stabilize reasoning and enhance reliability.

Result: MedMMV achieves up to 12.7% higher accuracy on six medical benchmarks compared to prior approaches. Blind evaluations by physicians show significantly improved reasoning truthfulness without a loss in informational content.

Conclusion: By controlling reasoning instability via a verifiable multi-agent process, MedMMV demonstrates a robust and practical methodology for deploying reliable AI models in high-stakes areas like clinical decision support.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
promising performance on medical benchmarks and in preliminary trials as
clinical assistants. Yet, our pilot audit of diagnostic cases uncovers a
critical failure mode: instability in early evidence interpretation precedes
hallucination, creating branching reasoning trajectories that cascade into
globally inconsistent conclusions. This highlights the need for clinical
reasoning agents that constrain stochasticity and hallucination while producing
auditable decision flows. We introduce MedMMV, a controllable multimodal
multi-agent framework for reliable and verifiable clinical reasoning. MedMMV
stabilizes reasoning through diversified short rollouts, grounds intermediate
steps in a structured evidence graph under the supervision of a Hallucination
Detector, and aggregates candidate paths with a Combined Uncertainty scorer. On
six medical benchmarks, MedMMV improves accuracy by up to 12.7% and, more
critically, demonstrates superior reliability. Blind physician evaluations
confirm that MedMMV substantially increases reasoning truthfulness without
sacrificing informational content. By controlling instability through a
verifiable, multi-agent process, our framework provides a robust path toward
deploying trustworthy AI systems in high-stakes domains like clinical decision
support.

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Fin-Solution 2.0," which includes Fin-Vault dataset and Fin-Ally model focused on improving financial chatbot responses through commonsense reasoning and polite conversational dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current financial chatbots occasionally deliver inappropriate or unprofessional responses due to limitations of fine-tuned LLMs and the lack of domain-specific datasets for multi-turn dialogues.

Method: Developed the Fin-Vault dataset with 1,417 annotated financial dialogues and created the Fin-Ally model using COMET-BART for commonsense context and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for alignment with human-like responses.

Result: Fin-Ally leverages the novel Fin-Vault dataset to surpass basic functionalities, offering sophisticated responses for budgeting, expense tracking, and financial planning with improved professional grounding and textual precision.

Conclusion: Introducing commonsense reasoning and domain-specific datasets enhances the relevance and professionalism of financial chatbot responses, making Fin-Ally a promising AI solution for the FinTech industry.

Abstract: The exponential technological breakthrough of the FinTech industry has
significantly enhanced user engagement through sophisticated advisory chatbots.
However, large-scale fine-tuning of LLMs can occasionally yield unprofessional
or flippant remarks, such as ``With that money, you're going to change the
world,'' which, though factually correct, can be contextually inappropriate and
erode user trust. The scarcity of domain-specific datasets has led previous
studies to focus on isolated components, such as reasoning-aware frameworks or
the enhancement of human-like response generation. To address this research
gap, we present Fin-Solution 2.O, an advanced solution that 1) introduces the
multi-turn financial conversational dataset, Fin-Vault, and 2) incorporates a
unified model, Fin-Ally, which integrates commonsense reasoning, politeness,
and human-like conversational dynamics. Fin-Ally is powered by
COMET-BART-embedded commonsense context and optimized with a Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) mechanism to generate human-aligned responses. The novel
Fin-Vault dataset, consisting of 1,417 annotated multi-turn dialogues, enables
Fin-Ally to extend beyond basic account management to provide personalized
budgeting, real-time expense tracking, and automated financial planning. Our
comprehensive results demonstrate that incorporating commonsense context
enables language models to generate more refined, textually precise, and
professionally grounded financial guidance, positioning this approach as a
next-generation AI solution for the FinTech sector. Dataset and codes are

TL;DR: The paper proposes Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS) to improve process data quality and train superior Process Reward Models (PRMs), yielding better mathematical reasoning performance in language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inefficiencies and inflexibilities in existing methods for estimating reasoning steps and expanding paths during automated data generation for PRMs.

Method: Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS) refines node value estimation dynamically by allocating samples based on uncertainty and enhances path expansion using an adaptive exploration-to-exploitation policy.

Result: AMCS creates MathSearch-200K dataset for PRMs, achieving up to 76.2% accuracy on MATH500 and showing superior generalization capabilities against out-of-distribution problems.

Conclusion: AMCS improves PRM training significantly, enabling smaller models to outperform larger ones under weaker supervision while maintaining strong generalization across mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The quality of process data plays a key role in training a Process Reward
Model (PRM), which can enhance the complex mathematical reasoning capability of
large language models. Existing methods estimate the quality of reasoning steps
based on a fixed-budget sampling strategy and navigate a vast search space to
perform path expansion during the automated data generation process, resulting
in their inefficiency and inflexibility. To address these issues, we propose
Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS), a framework that transforms data generation
from fixed, static to adaptive, dynamic search at the level of node value
estimation and path expansion. On one hand, AMCS adaptively refines estimation
by allocating more samples to uncertain reasoning steps while using fewer
samples for those that are easier to estimate. On the other hand, it enhances
the path expansion through a Monte Carlo algorithm with a temporally adaptive
policy that begins with broad exploration and gradually shifts toward
exploiting the most promising directions. With AMCS, we construct a large-scale
dataset MathSearch-200K of about 200K process supervision examples for training
PRMs. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive
experiments on four mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results
show that Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS achieves up to 76.2% accuracy on MATH500
with GLM-4-9B, outperforming all baseline PRMs. Notably, a 7B model supervised
by Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS surpasses a 72B model with weaker supervision.
Moreover, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS maintains consistent advantages on
out-of-distribution problems, demonstrating strong generalization capability.

### [101] [Plan before Solving: Problem-Aware Strategy Routing for Mathematical Reasoning with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24377)
*Shihao Qi,Jie Ma,Ziang Yin,Lingling Zhang,Jian Zhang,Jun Liu,Feng Tian,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The authors present PRISM, a novel framework for mathematical reasoning that uses adaptive strategy planning and execution to address the limitations of individual fixed reasoning strategies. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of fixed reasoning strategies in adapting to problem-specific requirements for mathematical reasoning, which leads to inefficiencies and reduced effectiveness.

Method: The PRISM framework separates mathematical reasoning into two stages: strategy planning and targeted execution. It uses a curated dataset, MathStrat, to train a Strategy Adapter for confidence distributions across reasoning strategies. A dynamic routing policy enables tailored strategy execution based on prediction confidence.

Result: PRISM consistently outperforms individual reasoning strategies and ensemble baselines, with improvements from 0.9% to 7.6% across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks and varying model architectures.

Conclusion: The adaptive routing policy in PRISM effectively leverages problem-specific strategy selection, proving to be a reliable and superior approach for enhancing mathematical reasoning performance in LLMs.

Abstract: Existing methods usually leverage a fixed strategy, such as natural language
reasoning, code-augmented reasoning, tool-integrated reasoning, or
ensemble-based reasoning, to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
mathematical reasoning. Our analysis reveals that the single strategy cannot
adapt to problem-specific requirements and thus overlooks the trade-off between
effectiveness and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Planning and
Routing through Instance-Specific Modeling (PRISM), a novel framework that
decouples mathematical reasoning into two stages: strategy planning and
targeted execution. Specifically, we first curate a multi-strategy preference
dataset, which we call MathStrat, capturing correctness, process quality, and
computational efficiency for each problem--strategy pair. Then, we train a
lightweight Strategy Adapter based on the dataset to obtain confidence
distributions over the mentioned four reasoning strategies. At inference time,
an adaptive routing policy dynamically tailors the reasoning approach based on
predictor confidence. It directs the model to use single-strategy execution for
high-confidence predictions, dual-strategy verification for competitive
scenarios, or comprehensive multi-strategy exploration for uncertain cases.
Extensive experiments across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that PRISM consistently outperforms individual strategies and ensemble
baselines, achieving improvements ranging from 0.9% to 7.6% across different
base models. The adaptive routing approach shows particularly strong benefits
for mathematical reasoning tasks across diverse model architectures. Our code
is released at https://github.com/reml-group/PRISM.

### [102] [Towards Safe Reasoning in Large Reasoning Models via Corrective Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24393)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses unsafe reasoning in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) and proposes a method called Intervened Preference Optimization (IPO) to improve reasoning and response safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LRMs face issues with unsafe reasoning in chain-of-thought processes, which undermine their trustworthiness and pose risks when exploited by malicious users.

Method: The authors propose IPO, which substitutes compliance steps with safety triggers and uses preference learning with strong safety signals to enforce safe reasoning.

Result: IPO improves safety significantly, reducing harmfulness by over 30% compared to baseline methods while maintaining high performance in reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Explicit alignment of reasoning safety enhances LRMs' trustworthiness and usability, offering a practical solution to safer applications.

Abstract: Although Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have progressed in solving complex
problems, their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning often contains harmful content
that can persist even when the final responses appear safe. We show that this
issue still remains in existing methods which overlook the unique significance
of safe reasoning, undermining their trustworthiness and posing potential risks
in applications if unsafe reasoning is accessible for and exploited by
malicious users. We therefore shift our focus to aligning the safety of
reasoning itself in this paper and explore process supervision as the solution.
However, simply rewarding safe reasoning proves inadequate due to low rollout
diversity and limited training signals. To tackle this challenge, we first
delve into the characteristics of safe reasoning and uncover several critical
insights that 1) safe reasoning is often consolidated by a few critical steps
of safety triggers; 2) compliance cues strongly correlate with unsafe
continuations; and 3) corrective interventions reliably steer unsafe
trajectories towards safer traces. Motivated by these, we propose Intervened
Preference Optimization (IPO), an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning
by substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing pairs
for preference learning with strong signals. Experiments on jailbreak and
adversarial safety benchmarks demonstrate that IPO remarkably improves overall
safety regarding both reasoning and responses, outperforming SFT-based and
RL-based baselines with a relative reduction of over 30% in harmfulness, while
preserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The results
highlight the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning and provide a
practical path to safer LRMs.

*Haotian Zhang,Liu Liu,Baosheng Yu,Jiayan Qiu,Likang Xiao,Yanwei Ren,Quan Chen,Xianglong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents ContextPRM, a model focused on improving the generalization abilities of process reward models (PRMs) in diverse domains beyond mathematics by shifting the learning objective towards domain-agnostic logical flows and contextual coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limited generalization of PRMs, which excel in mathematical reasoning but struggle in non-mathematical domains due to the lack of domain-specific data and knowledge-learning patterns.

Method: The authors propose shifting the learning objective to focus on domain-agnostic logical flows and contextual coherence in chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, realized through an innovative data annotation and training framework.

Result: ContextPRM achieves a 6.5% accuracy improvement on average across nine non-mathematical domains in MMLU-Pro, outperforming both mathematics-focused PRMs and a lead alternative, VersaPRM.

Conclusion: ContextPRM demonstrates superior generalization performance across mathematical and non-mathematical domains, showcasing its effectiveness for diverse applications.

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) have demonstrated significant efficacy in
enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by leveraging test-time scaling (TTS). However, while most PRMs exhibit
substantial gains in mathematical domains, the scarcity of domain-specific
training data and knowledge-based learning patterns limits their generalization
ability when faced with other domains. To address this limitation, we shift the
learning objective from verifying domain-specific knowledge to modeling
domain-agnostic logical flow. Centering on contextual coherence between
chain-of-thought (CoT) steps, our approach is realized through a novel data
annotation and training framework, which enhances the model's generalization
capabilities across diverse domains. For instance, our resulting model,
ContextPRM, achieves a notable 6.5% average accuracy improvement over the
majority voting baseline via weighted majority voting across nine
non-mathematical domains in MMLU-Pro, including law, history, and philosophy,
significantly surpassing the 2.2% improvement from VersaPRM and 0.5% gains from
other mathematics-focused PRMs, demonstrating consistent performance across
both mathematical and non-mathematical domains.

*Vasileios Balafas,Dimos Tsouros,Nikolaos Ploskas,Kostas Stergiou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops a hybrid framework for Constraint Acquisition that combines passive learning, interactive refinement with probabilistic confidence, and active learning to overcome overfitting and improve model accuracy with limited data and queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual Constraint Programming modeling is labor-intensive, and current automated solutions like Constraint Acquisition face challenges of overfitting and query inefficiency.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid framework combining passive learning for candidate generation, interactive refinement based on probabilistic confidence scores, subset exploration mechanisms, and a final active learning phase for model completeness.

Result: Experiments show that the interactive refinement phase significantly improves target model coverage and accuracy while maintaining reasonable query complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is a step forward in Constraint Acquisition, making it more robust and practical in scenarios with limited data and queries.

Abstract: Manual modeling in Constraint Programming is a substantial bottleneck, which
Constraint Acquisition (CA) aims to automate. However, passive CA methods are
prone to over-fitting, often learning models that include spurious global
constraints when trained on limited data, while purely active methods can be
query-intensive. We introduce a hybrid CA framework specifically designed to
address the challenge of over-fitting in CA. Our approach integrates passive
learning for initial candidate generation, a query-driven interactive
refinement phase that utilizes probabilistic confidence scores (initialized by
machine learning priors) to systematically identify over-fitted constraints,
and a specialized subset exploration mechanism to recover valid substructures
from rejected candidates. A final active learning phase ensures model
completeness. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our
interactive refinement phase is crucial for achieving high target model
coverage and overall model accuracy from limited examples, doing so with
manageable query complexity. This framework represents a substantial
advancement towards robust and practical constraint acquisition in data-limited
scenarios.

Result: NMT-Net demonstrated superior performance on three real-world datasets from Kaggle, achieving lower RMSE and standard deviation compared to traditional and state-of-the-art multi-task methods.

Conclusion: NMT-Net provides a scalable and adaptable solution for multi-task and continual learning in time series prediction, outperforming current methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to Dynamic Artificial Neural Networks
(D-ANNs) for multi-task demand forecasting called Neuroplastic Multi-Task
Network (NMT-Net). Unlike conventional methods focusing on inference-time
dynamics or computational efficiency, our proposed method enables structural
adaptability of the computational graph during training, inspired by
neuroplasticity as seen in biological systems. Each new task triggers a dynamic
network adaptation, including similarity-based task identification and
selective training of candidate ANN heads, which are then assessed and
integrated into the model based on their performance. We evaluated our
framework using three real-world multi-task demand forecasting datasets from
Kaggle. We demonstrated its superior performance and consistency, achieving
lower RMSE and standard deviation compared to traditional baselines and
state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods. NMT-Net offers a scalable,
adaptable solution for multi-task and continual learning in time series
prediction. The complete code for NMT-Net is available from our GitHub

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces EvoPH, a framework that co-evolves prompts and heuristic algorithms using LLMs to tackle combinatorial optimization problems. It improves upon typical methods by addressing local optima stagnation, yielding superior results on benchmark problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditionally, solving combinatorial optimization problems requires handcrafted algorithms, which rely on domain expertise and are labor-intensive to develop. Leveraging LLMs for automatic heuristic design shows promise but often results in solutions stuck in local optima.

Method: The authors propose EvoPH, a system integrating island migration and elite selection algorithms to co-evolve prompts and heuristic algorithms. Performance feedback guides the evolution process.

Result: EvoPH was tested on the Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem, achieving the lowest relative error against optimal solutions compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: EvoPH effectively advances automatic algorithm design using LLMs by overcoming stagnation issues and demonstrating performance improvements on benchmark optimization problems.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with
handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and
significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the
potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models
(LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These
approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as
mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such
methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we
propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics
(EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the
island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse
heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic
algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two
problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem.
Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error
against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of
automatic algorithm design with LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a human-agent teaching approach to enable AI systems to perform subjective tasks like ingredient substitution with minimal examples, utilizing domain knowledge and strategic example selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems struggle with rapid learning from few examples, especially for subjective tasks. The paper aims to address this limitation by creating an intuitive teaching process between humans and agents.

Method: The authors propose a teaching architecture where agents learn incrementally from few examples, integrating domain knowledge and strategic example selection. They use the Recipe1MSubs dataset to simulate human input for ingredient substitution tasks.

Result: The agent achieves half its task performance with just 100 examples, compared to a complete training set of 50k examples, by strategically selecting demonstrations and leveraging symbolic knowledge.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates that efficient learning from limited, strategically chosen examples is possible, which can enhance human-agent interactions for tasks with data scarcity.

Abstract: Humans quickly learn new concepts from a small number of examples.
Replicating this capacity with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems has proven
to be challenging. When it comes to learning subjective tasks-where there is an
evident scarcity of data-this capacity needs to be recreated. In this work, we
propose an intuitive human-agent teaching architecture in which the human can
teach an agent how to perform a task by providing demonstrations, i.e.,
examples. To have an intuitive interaction, we argue that the agent should be
able to learn incrementally from a few single examples. To allow for this, our
objective is to broaden the agent's task understanding using domain knowledge.
Then, using a learning method to enable the agent to learn efficiently from a
limited number of examples. Finally, to optimize how human can select the most
representative and less redundant examples to provide the agent with. We apply
our proposed method to the subjective task of ingredient substitution, where
the agent needs to learn how to substitute ingredients in recipes based on
human examples. We replicate human input using the Recipe1MSubs dataset. In our
experiments, the agent achieves half its task performance after only 100
examples are provided, compared to the complete training set of 50k examples.
We show that by providing examples in strategic order along with a learning
method that leverages external symbolic knowledge, the agent can generalize
more efficiently.

*Nikolaos Kondylidis,Anil Yaman,Frank van Harmelen,Erman Acar,Annette ten Teije*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies communication in signaling games where agents, with different perceptions, develop and refine signals for coordination. While optimal coordination is achieved, misaligned understanding can lead to successful misunderstandings, difficult to detect and repair.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate communication emergence and the assumption that understanding is required for coordination, especially in hybrid populations involving humans and artificial agents.

Method: A signaling game was designed where agents develop and use signals while lacking shared observations. The interaction depends only on communication signals and received rewards.

Result: Agents in the game converged to optimal coordination levels, but sometimes achieved "successful misunderstandings" with misaligned signal interpretations.

Conclusion: Successful misunderstandings hinder new coordination efforts and require at least three agents interacting together to ensure emergence of shared interpretations, enabling robust and aligned communication.

Abstract: The main approach to evaluating communication is by assessing how well it
facilitates coordination. If two or more individuals can coordinate through
communication, it is generally assumed that they understand one another. We
investigate this assumption in a signaling game where individuals develop a new
vocabulary of signals to coordinate successfully. In our game, the individuals
do not have common observations besides the communication signal and outcome of
the interaction, i.e. received reward. This setting is used as a proxy to study
communication emergence in populations of agents that perceive their
environment very differently, e.g. hybrid populations that include humans and
artificial agents. Agents develop signals, use them, and refine interpretations
while not observing how other agents are using them. While populations always
converge to optimal levels of coordination, in some cases, interacting agents
interpret and use signals differently, converging to what we call successful
misunderstandings. However, agents of population that coordinate using
misaligned interpretations, are unable to establish successful coordination
with new interaction partners. Not leading to coordination failure immediately,
successful misunderstandings are difficult to spot and repair. Having at least
three agents that all interact with each other are the two minimum conditions
to ensure the emergence of shared interpretations. Under these conditions, the
agent population exhibits this emergent property of compensating for the lack
of shared observations of signal use, ensuring the emergence of shared
interpretations.

TL;DR: The paper explores how Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) can recognize their own limitations, using confidence signals and hidden states to avoid engaging in unproductive reasoning, leading to improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of LRMs wasting computational resources by engaging in unproductive reasoning on questions beyond their capability boundaries.

Method: The authors analyzed expressed reasoning confidence and hidden states to identify solvability signals for both black-box and white-box models. They proposed optimization strategies based on reasoning expression monitoring and hidden states monitoring.

Result: Experiments showed these strategies greatly reduce unproductive reasoning, cutting token usage by 62.7 - 93.6%, without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: Incorporating capability-boundary awareness into LRMs enhances their reliability and computational efficiency, addressing key limitations of current answering paradigms.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks such as mathematics, yet they also display misbehaviors that
expose their limitations. In particular, when faced with hard questions, LRMs
often engage in unproductive reasoning until context limit, producing wrong
answers while wasting substantial computation. This phenomenon reflects a
fundamental issue: current answering paradigms overlook the relationship
between questions and LRMs' capability boundaries. In this paper, we
investigate whether LRMs possess self-awareness of capability boundaries. We
begin by an observation that LRMs may know what they cannot solve through
expressed reasoning confidence. For black-box models, we find that reasoning
expressions reveal boundary signals, with accelerated growing confidence
trajectory for solvable problems but convergent uncertainty trajectory for
unsolvable ones. For white-box models, we show that hidden states of the last
input token encode boundary information, with solvable and unsolvable problems
linearly separable even before reasoning begins. Building on these findings, we
propose two simple yet effective optimization strategies: reasoning expression
monitoring and hidden states monitoring. Experiments demonstrate that these
boundary-aware strategies enable LRMs to avoid unproductive reasoning without
sacrificing accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency by
cutting token usage up to 62.7 - 93.6%.

Conclusion: Integrating graph-based learning with contrastive objectives significantly improves EEG-based decoding, enabling more robust and generalizable neural representations.

Abstract: Decoding visual neural representations from Electroencephalography (EEG)

simultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics.
To mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype

to improve feature consistency and class separability. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations on the

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes LogicAgent, a semiotic-square-guided reasoning framework, and introduces RepublicQA, a challenging benchmark for evaluating logical reasoning in LLMs. Results show significant performance gains over existing methods and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for logical reasoning in LLMs struggle to handle scenarios with complex semantics and abstract propositions, which are central to human reasoning.

Method: LogicAgent employs a semiotic-square-guided framework using multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic (FOL). It introduces existential import checks and a three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain) to handle boundary cases. Additionally, a new benchmark, RepublicQA, is introduced to assess these capabilities.

Result: LogicAgent outperforms strong baselines on RepublicQA, achieving a 6.25% gain. It also generalizes effectively to existing benchmarks like ProntoQA and ProofWriter, with an additional average gain of 7.05%.

Conclusion: LogicAgent and the RepublicQA benchmark improve LLM performance in logical reasoning by addressing both logical and semantic complexities, demonstrating their potential in enhancing human-level reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a fundamental capability of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing studies largely overlook the interplay between
logical complexity and semantic complexity, resulting in methods that struggle
to address challenging scenarios involving abstract propositions, ambiguous
contexts, and conflicting stances, which are central to human reasoning. For
this gap, we propose LogicAgent, a semiotic-square-guided framework designed to
jointly address logical complexity and semantic complexity. LogicAgent
explicitly performs multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic (FOL),
while mitigating vacuous reasoning through existential import checks that
incorporate a three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain) to handle
boundary cases more faithfully. Furthermore, to overcome the semantic
simplicity and low logical complexity of existing datasets, we introduce
RepublicQA, a benchmark that reaches college-level difficulty (FKGL = 11.94)
and exhibits substantially greater lexical and structural diversity than prior
benchmarks. RepublicQA is grounded in philosophical concepts, featuring
abstract propositions and systematically organized contrary and contradictory
relations, making it the most semantically rich resource for evaluating logical
reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that LogicAgent achieves state-of-the-art
performance on RepublicQA, with a 6.25% average gain over strong baselines, and
generalizes effectively to mainstream logical reasoning benchmarks including
ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA, achieving an additional 7.05%
average gain. These results highlight the strong effectiveness of our
semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning in boosting LLMs' logical
performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TSR-Suite, a multimodal time series reasoning framework, alongside TimeOmni-1, a unified reasoning model, demonstrating advances in reasoning and forecasting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the lack of tasks and data demanding genuine reasoning in multimodal time series analysis, limiting the development of practical time series reasoning models.

Method: The authors formalize four atomic tasks within TSR-Suite for perception, extrapolation, and decision-making. Additionally, they introduce TimeOmni-1, a unified model trained on diverse tasks with novel reward functions and optimizations.

Result: TimeOmni-1 exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization, improves causality discovery accuracy (64.0% vs 35.9% with GPT-4.1), and increases valid response rates in event-aware forecasting tasks by over 6%.

Conclusion: TSR-Suite and TimeOmni-1 pave the way for advanced multimodal time series reasoning, addressing gaps in genuine reasoning tasks and establishing benchmarks for future research.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal time series learning underscore a paradigm
shift from analytics centered on basic patterns toward advanced time series
understanding and reasoning. However, existing multimodal time series datasets
mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without
reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that
genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of
high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series
reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite
(TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental
capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through
scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via
event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through
deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first
comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough
evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more
than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided
hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce
TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse
real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in
multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward
functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1
delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and
achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality
discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response

### [114] [Query Circuits: Explaining How Language Models Answer User Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24808)
*Tung-Yu Wu,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'query circuits' for explaining specific outputs of language models by directly tracing information flow within the model, achieving sparse and faithful input-level explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explanation methods focus on global capabilities and fail to address why a language model produces a specific output for a particular input.

Method: The study introduces 'query circuits,' uses Normalized Deviation Faithfulness (NDF) as a metric for evaluation, and employs efficient sampling-based methods to identify sparse, faithful circuits within models.

Result: Query circuits were shown to be highly sparse yet effective, recovering up to 60% of a model’s performance with only 1.3% of model connections on the MMLU benchmark.

Conclusion: Query circuits offer a scalable, faithful way to explain individual outputs of language models, advancing our understanding of specific information flows within models.

Abstract: Explaining why a language model produces a particular output requires local,
input-level explanations. Existing methods uncover global capability circuits
(e.g., indirect object identification), but not why the model answers a
specific input query in a particular way. We introduce query circuits, which
directly trace the information flow inside a model that maps a specific input
to the output. Unlike surrogate-based approaches (e.g., sparse autoencoders),
query circuits are identified within the model itself, resulting in more
faithful and computationally accessible explanations. To make query circuits
practical, we address two challenges. First, we introduce Normalized Deviation
Faithfulness (NDF), a robust metric to evaluate how well a discovered circuit
recovers the model's decision for a specific input, and is broadly applicable
to circuit discovery beyond our setting. Second, we develop sampling-based
methods to efficiently identify circuits that are sparse yet faithfully
describe the model's behavior. Across benchmarks (IOI, arithmetic, MMLU, and
ARC), we find that there exist extremely sparse query circuits within the model
that can recover much of its performance on single queries. For example, a
circuit covering only 1.3% of model connections can recover about 60% of
performance on an MMLU questions. Overall, query circuits provide a step
towards faithful, scalable explanations of how language models process
individual inputs.

### [115] [Pushing LLMs to Their Logical Reasoning Bound: The Role of Data Reasoning Intensity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24836)
*Zhen Bi,Zhenlin Hu,Jinnan Yang,Mingyang Chen,Cheng Deng,Yida Xue,Zeyu Yang,Qing Shen,Zhenfang Liu,Kang Zhao,Ningyu Zhang,Jungang Lou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops a novel metric (Data Reasoning Intensity) and strategy for enhancing logical reasoning performance of large language models by focusing on reasoning complexity of the data itself rather than volume or format.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most methods optimizing training for LLMs neglect reasoning complexity in data, leading to underutilized potential of data in shaping reasoning behavior.

Method: The authors introduce the Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI) metric to quantify logical complexity and propose a re-cognizing optimization approach to enhance reasoning intensity in training data.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in performance and generalization upon applying this optimization strategy, especially compared to data-centric approaches.

Conclusion: Prioritizing reasoning complexity in training data over data quantity or superficial formatting is crucial to leveraging the full cognitive capacity of LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of
training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However,
most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting
the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning
potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that
LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of
the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this
relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel
metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by
decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze
how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify
performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we
introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the
logical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data
volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's
logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach
significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric
strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning
framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data
rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs'
full cognitive potential.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PhysicsMinions is a multi-agent system designed to solve Physics Olympiad problems, achieving groundbreaking performance, including multiple gold medals for open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI struggles with high-level reasoning required for Physics Olympiads, so PhysicsMinions aims to address this challenge by enhancing multimodal understanding and achieving competitive-level performance.

Method: PhysicsMinions is composed of three studios (Visual, Logic, Review) that work synergistically in an iterative refinement loop, enabling self-correction and convergence to accurate solutions.

Result: PhysicsMinions significantly improves the performance of both open-source and closed-source models, achieving historic breakthroughs across 7 Physics Olympiads, including multiple gold medals for open-source systems.

Conclusion: This system provides a scalable and generalizable framework for complex problem-solving in physics, with implications for extending across other disciplines.

Abstract: Physics is central to understanding and shaping the real world, and the
ability to solve physics problems is a key indicator of real-world physical
intelligence. Physics Olympiads, renowned as the crown of competitive physics,
provide a rigorous testbed requiring complex reasoning and deep multimodal
understanding, yet they remain largely underexplored in AI research. Existing
approaches are predominantly single-model based, and open-source MLLMs rarely
reach gold-medal-level performance. To address this gap, we propose
PhysicsMinions, a coevolutionary multi-agent system for Physics Olympiad. Its
architecture features three synergistic studios: a Visual Studio to interpret
diagrams, a Logic Studio to formulate solutions, and a Review Studio to perform
dual-stage verification. The system coevolves through an iterative refinement
loop where feedback from the Review Studio continuously guides the Logic
Studio, enabling the system to self-correct and converge towards the ground
truth. Evaluated on the HiPhO benchmark spanning 7 latest physics Olympiads,
PhysicsMinions delivers three major breakthroughs: (i) Strong generalization:
it consistently improves both open-source and closed-source models of different
sizes, delivering clear benefits over their single-model baselines; (ii)
Historic breakthroughs: it elevates open-source models from only 1-2 to 6 gold
medals across 7 Olympiads, achieving the first-ever open-source gold medal in
the latest International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) under the average-score
metric; and (iii) Scaling to human expert: it further advances the open-source
Pass@32 score to 26.8/30 points on the latest IPhO, ranking 4th of 406
contestants and far surpassing the top single-model score of 22.7 (ranked
22nd). Generally, PhysicsMinions offers a generalizable framework for
Olympiad-level problem solving, with the potential to extend across
disciplines.

### [117] [The Emergence of Social Science of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24877)
*Xiao Jia,Zhanzhan Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper provides a systematic review of 270 studies on the social sciences of large language models (LLMs), introducing a computational taxonomy encompassing three domains: Social Minds, Societies, and Human Interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the fragmented research in the social sciences of LLMs and establish a clear taxonomy to promote a cumulative understanding of their societal impacts.

Method: A systematic review was conducted on 270 studies. Text embeddings, unsupervised clustering, and topic modeling techniques were used to build a computational taxonomy of the research field.

Result: Three domains emerged organically through the analysis: LLM as Social Minds, LLM Societies, and LLM-Human Interactions, providing insights into cognition attribution, multi-agent interaction protocols, and human-interface transformation.

Conclusion: This taxonomy reconciles fragmented research, establishes evidentiary standards, and enables systematic progression in understanding the societal roles and implications of LLMs.

Abstract: The social science of large language models (LLMs) examines how these systems
evoke mind attributions, interact with one another, and transform human
activity and institutions. We conducted a systematic review of 270 studies,
combining text embeddings, unsupervised clustering and topic modeling to build
a computational taxonomy. Three domains emerge organically across the reviewed
literature. LLM as Social Minds examines whether and when models display
behaviors that elicit attributions of cognition, morality and bias, while
addressing challenges such as test leakage and surface cues. LLM Societies
examines multi-agent settings where interaction protocols, architectures and
mechanism design shape coordination, norms, institutions and collective
epistemic processes. LLM-Human Interactions examines how LLMs reshape tasks,
learning, trust, work and governance, and how risks arise at the human-AI
interface. This taxonomy provides a reproducible map of a fragmented field,
clarifies evidentiary standards across levels of analysis, and highlights
opportunities for cumulative progress in the social science of artificial
intelligence.

### [118] [RealUnify: Do Unified Models Truly Benefit from Unification? A Comprehensive Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24897)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RealUnify, a benchmark designed to assess whether unified multimodal AI models can synergize visual understanding and generation. Current models struggle, implying unification isn't enough.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether integrating visual understanding and generation into unified multimodal models leads to meaningful synergies, a gap not covered by current benchmarks.

Method: The authors created RealUnify, a benchmark with 1,000 annotated instances spanning multiple tasks, and a dual-evaluation protocol to evaluate bidirectional synergy between understanding and generation.

Result: Evaluations reveal that unified models often fail to achieve effective synergy, showing deficiencies in integrating understanding and generation capabilities.

Conclusion: Architectural unification alone does not guarantee synergy between understanding and generation; new training methods are required to realize the full potential of unified models.

Abstract: The integration of visual understanding and generation into unified
multimodal models represents a significant stride toward general-purpose AI.
However, a fundamental question remains unanswered by existing benchmarks: does
this architectural unification actually enable synergetic interaction between
the constituent capabilities? Existing evaluation paradigms, which primarily
assess understanding and generation in isolation, are insufficient for
determining whether a unified model can leverage its understanding to enhance
its generation, or use generative simulation to facilitate deeper
comprehension. To address this critical gap, we introduce RealUnify, a
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate bidirectional capability synergy.
RealUnify comprises 1,000 meticulously human-annotated instances spanning 10
categories and 32 subtasks. It is structured around two core axes: 1)
Understanding Enhances Generation, which requires reasoning (e.g., commonsense,
logic) to guide image generation, and 2) Generation Enhances Understanding,
which necessitates mental simulation or reconstruction (e.g., of transformed or
disordered visual inputs) to solve reasoning tasks. A key contribution is our
dual-evaluation protocol, which combines direct end-to-end assessment with a
diagnostic stepwise evaluation that decomposes tasks into distinct
understanding and generation phases. This protocol allows us to precisely
discern whether performance bottlenecks stem from deficiencies in core
abilities or from a failure to integrate them. Through large-scale evaluations
of 12 leading unified models and 6 specialized baselines, we find that current
unified models still struggle to achieve effective synergy, indicating that
architectural unification alone is insufficient. These results highlight the
need for new training strategies and inductive biases to fully unlock the
potential of unified modeling.

*Max Pellert,Clemens M. Lechner,Indira Sen,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes SQuID, a method leveraging neural network embeddings to replicate human-judged psychometric dimensions, achieving 55% variance explanation and showing promising scalability and cost-effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient and scalable method that generates psychometric structures from survey items using neural network embeddings, bypassing the challenges of traditional costly data collection and fine-tuning methods.

Method: The authors introduce SQuID, which uses embeddings from large language models to recover psychometric dimensions. They validated the approach using the Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire, comparing multiple embedding models and evaluation metrics.

Result: SQuID recovers 55% of variance in dimension-dimension similarities compared to human judgments, exhibits fair factor congruence, and aligns with the theoretical structure of psychometric dimensions.

Conclusion: SQuID offers a complementary, scalable, and cost-effective method to traditional psychometrics, maintaining comparable quality while broadening the scope of represented human behavior and experience.

Abstract: This study introduces "Survey and Questionnaire Item Embeddings
Differentials" (SQuID), a novel methodological approach that enables neural
network embeddings to effectively recover latent dimensions from psychometric
survey items. We demonstrate that embeddings derived from large language
models, when processed with SQuID, can recover the structure of human values
obtained from human rater judgments on the Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire
(PVQ-RR). Our experimental validation compares multiple embedding models across
a number of evaluation metrics. Unlike previous approaches, SQuID successfully
addresses the challenge of obtaining negative correlations between dimensions
without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. Quantitative analysis reveals
that our embedding-based approach explains 55% of variance in
dimension-dimension similarities compared to human data. Multidimensional
scaling configurations from both types of data show fair factor congruence
coefficients and largely follow the underlying theory. These results
demonstrate that semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric
structures previously established through extensive human surveys. The approach
offers substantial advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility while
maintaining comparable quality to traditional methods. Our findings have
significant implications for psychometrics and social science research,
providing a complementary methodology that could expand the scope of human
behavior and experience represented in measurement tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks and evaluation methods tailored for multi-agent systems (MAS) in the legal domain, which limits their potential.

Method: The authors design MASLegalBench, a legal benchmark aimed at multi-agent systems, adopting a deductive reasoning approach and using GDPR as the application case. They also design role-based MAS setups and conduct experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: Experiments showcased the strengths, weaknesses, and improvement areas for both existing models and MAS architectures in handling legal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: MASLegalBench effectively aids in evaluating and advancing multi-agent systems for legal applications, demonstrating the utility of MAS in complex legal reasoning scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS), leveraging the remarkable capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), show great potential in addressing complex tasks. In
this context, integrating MAS with legal tasks is a crucial step. While
previous studies have developed legal benchmarks for LLM agents, none are
specifically designed to consider the unique advantages of MAS, such as task
decomposition, agent specialization, and flexible training. In fact, the lack
of evaluation methods limits the potential of MAS in the legal domain. To
address this gap, we propose MASLegalBench, a legal benchmark tailored for MAS
and designed with a deductive reasoning approach. Our benchmark uses GDPR as
the application scenario, encompassing extensive background knowledge and
covering complex reasoning processes that effectively reflect the intricacies
of real-world legal situations. Furthermore, we manually design various
role-based MAS and conduct extensive experiments using different
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results highlight the strengths, limitations, and
potential areas for improvement of existing models and MAS architectures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SciExplorer, a tool leveraging large language model capabilities to autonomously explore unknown physical systems and derive scientific insights without domain-specific tailoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of automating the discovery process of physical laws and properties in unknown systems using a generalized approach without task-specific instructions.

Method: SciExplorer employs large language models with tool-use functionalities, focusing on free-form exploration using code execution, applied to diverse examples like mechanical dynamics, wave evolution, and quantum physics.

Result: SciExplorer demonstrated strong performance in recovering equations of motion and inferring Hamiltonians from physics-based observations, using minimal external configurations.

Conclusion: The approach suggests a promising pathway for autonomous scientific exploration across various domains without requiring additional tuning or instructions tailored to particular tasks.

Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations,
analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being
adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an
open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop
required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through
experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a
given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large
language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems
without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of
physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer
on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution,
and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily
based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as
recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring
Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this
setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains,
without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.

*Shijie Zhang,Guohao Sun,Kevin Zhang,Xiang Guo,Rujun Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes CLPO, a curriculum-guided learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts training problems to optimize LLMs' reasoning efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods uniformly treat all training samples, neglecting differences in problem difficulty and hindering both learning efficiency and maximum performance.

Method: CLPO dynamically assesses problem difficulty based on the model's rollout performance, creating an online curriculum that adapts problems to the model's learning state by simplifying hard problems and diversifying medium-difficulty ones.

Result: CLPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight benchmarks with an average pass@1 improvement of 6.96% compared to other methods.

Conclusion: By integrating dynamic curricula into policy optimization, CLPO enhances both the learning efficiency and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, paving the way for more effective model training.

Abstract: Recently, online Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has
become a key paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods typically treat all training
samples uniformly, overlooking the vast differences in problem difficulty
relative to the model's current capabilities. This uniform training strategy
leads to inefficient exploration of problems the model has already mastered,
while concurrently lacking effective guidance on problems that are challenging
its abilities the most, limiting both learning efficiency and upper-bound
performance. To address this, we propose CLPO (Curriculum-guided Learning for
Policy Optimization), a novel algorithm that creates a dynamic pedagogical
feedback loop within the policy optimization process. The core of CLPO
leverages the model's own rollout performance to conduct real-time difficulty
assessment, thereby constructing an Online Curriculum. This curriculum then
guides an Adaptive Problem Restructuring mechanism, where the model acts as its
own teacher: it diversifies medium-difficulty problems to promote
generalization and simplifies challenging problems to make them more
attainable. Our approach transforms the static training procedure into a
dynamic process that co-evolves with the model's capabilities. Experiments show
that CLPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight challenging
mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks, with an average pass@1
improvement of 6.96% over other methods, demonstrating its potential for more
efficiently training more capable reasoning models.

TL;DR: AutoPlay introduces a scalable pipeline for interactive task generation, allowing MLLMs to train UI agents efficiently and achieve improved success rates in mobile and computer-use scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of scaling post-training for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in building interactive agents, due to the lack of diverse, high-quality datasets for downstream tasks.

Method: AutoPlay explores environments using a systematic MLLM explorer agent to uncover functionalities and uses task guideline prompts to synthesize diverse, feasible tasks grounded in specific environments.

Result: AutoPlay generated 20k tasks for Android apps and 10k for Ubuntu apps, enabling MLLM task execution without human annotation. Models trained on these data achieved up to 20% improvement in mobile-use and 10.9% improvement in computer-use scenarios, with reinforcement learning adding a further 5.7% gain.

Conclusion: AutoPlay provides an effective and scalable solution for post-training MLLMs by reducing dependence on human annotation and enhancing training outcomes for interactive agents.

Abstract: Post-Training Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to build interactive
agents holds promise across domains such as computer-use, web navigation, and
robotics. A key challenge in scaling such post-training is lack of high-quality
downstream agentic task datasets with tasks that are diverse, feasible, and
verifiable. Existing approaches for task generation rely heavily on human
annotation or prompting MLLM with limited downstream environment information,
which is either costly or poorly scalable as it yield tasks with limited
coverage. To remedy this, we present AutoPlay, a scalable pipeline for task
generation that explicitly explores interactive environments to discover
possible interactions and current state information to synthesize
environment-grounded tasks. AutoPlay operates in two stages: (i) an exploration
phase, where an MLLM explorer agent systematically uncovers novel environment
states and functionalities, and (ii) a task generation phase, where a task
generator leverages exploration trajectories and a set of task guideline
prompts as context to synthesize diverse, executable, and verifiable tasks. We
show AutoPlay generates 20k tasks across 20 Android applications and 10k tasks
across 13 applications Ubuntu applications to train mobile-use and computer-use
agents. AutoPlay generated tasks enable large-scale task demonstration
synthesis without human annotation by employing an MLLM task executor and
verifier. This data enables training MLLM-based UI agents that improve success
rates up to $20.0\%$ on mobile-use and $10.9\%$ on computer-use scenarios. In
addition, AutoPlay generated tasks combined with MLLM verifier-based rewards
enable scaling reinforcement learning training of UI agents, leading to an
additional $5.7\%$ gain. coverage. These results establish AutoPlay as a
scalable approach for post-training capable MLLM agents reducing reliance on
human annotation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to develop artificial agents capable of building an interpretable and transparent understanding of their environment to improve reinforcement learning, which often relies on opaque neural network weights.

Method: The CEL agent iteratively interacts with its environment, building its knowledge through Rule Induction (environment dynamics) and Strategy Summarization (actionable playbooks) using LLMs. It starts from no prior knowledge except the action set.

Result: The CEL agent successfully mastered grid-world tasks like Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban, autonomously discovering rules and crafting effective strategies. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of the iterative learning process.

Conclusion: CEL demonstrates the feasibility of agents that learn effectively while building interpretable models of their world, providing insights through explicit reasoning on raw experiences.

Abstract: The pursuit of artificial agents that can learn to master complex
environments has led to remarkable successes, yet prevailing deep reinforcement
learning methods often rely on immense experience, encoding their knowledge
opaquely within neural network weights. We propose a different paradigm, one in
which an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito,
ergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language
Model (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its
environment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state
with no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of
interaction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete
trajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where
it refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and
Playbook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable
strategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e.,
Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent
successfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their
rules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies
confirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work
demonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only
act effectively but also build a transparent and improving model of their world
through explicit reasoning on raw experience.

Motivation: Fragmented scientific understanding of heatwave risks across climate, social, and economic systems limits effective adaptation strategies.

Method: The authors developed HeDA, a multi-agent system using automated knowledge graph construction and multi-layer risk propagation analysis from academic papers.

Result: HeDA achieved 78.9% accuracy on question-answering tasks, outperformed GPT-4 by 13.7%, and discovered five high-impact risk pathways validated via case studies and expert reviews.

Conclusion: HeDA demonstrates the potential of AI-driven scientific discovery to enhance resilience against climate risks and provide actionable insights for decision-making.

Abstract: Heatwaves pose complex cascading risks across interconnected climate, social,
and economic systems, but knowledge fragmentation in scientific literature
hinders comprehensive understanding of these risk pathways. We introduce HeDA
(Heatwave Discovery Agent), an intelligent multi-agent system designed for
automated scientific discovery through knowledge graph construction and
multi-layer risk propagation analysis. HeDA processes over 10,247 academic
papers to construct a comprehensive knowledge graph with 23,156 nodes and
89,472 relationships, employing novel multi-layer risk propagation analysis to
systematically identify overlooked risk transmission pathways. Our system
achieves 78.9% accuracy on complex question-answering tasks, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines including GPT-4 by 13.7%. Critically, HeDA
successfully discovered five previously unidentified high-impact risk chains,
such as the pathway where a heatwave leads to a water demand surge, resulting
in industrial water restrictions and ultimately causing small business
disruption, which were validated through historical case studies and domain
expert review. This work presents a new paradigm for AI-driven scientific
discovery, providing actionable insights for developing more resilient climate

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether reinforcement learning (RL) enables language models (LLMs) to acquire genuinely new skills by composing existing ones. It provides evidence of new skill acquisition and generalization through a synthetic string transformation task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the debate on whether RL introduces new skills to LLMs or merely reweights existing ones. The paper aims to understand skill composition and transfer in LLMs.

Method: A synthetic task framework is used to study the ability to learn string transformation compositions. The authors test RL's ability to help LLMs learn and generalize compositions of functions, both seen and unseen during training.

Result: Experiments show that RL enables LLMs to acquire and generalize new compositional skills. These skills transfer to unseen tasks with minimal prior training, unlike next-token supervision.

Conclusion: The findings highlight RL's potential to fundamentally augment LLM reasoning capabilities, suggesting a strategy of building base models first and then refining them with RL to develop generalizable advanced skills.

Abstract: Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing
ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in
LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with
RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue
that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.
This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills
during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms
by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination
and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task
complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.
Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string
transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g
prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen
compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability
generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions
unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that
compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target
task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target,
requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative
analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the
models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of
these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM
learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills,
then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex
problems.

### [128] [The Era of Real-World Human Interaction: RL from User Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25137)
*Chuanyang Jin,Jing Xu,Bo Liu,Leitian Tao,Olga Golovneva,Tianmin Shu,Wenting Zhao,Xian Li,Jason Weston*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reinforcement Learning from Human Interaction (RLHI), a technique that uses organic user conversations to continually improve conversational models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conversational AI models rely on pre-annotated expert feedback, and the authors aim to shift towards learning directly through natural human interaction for better alignment and personalization.

Method: The authors propose two RLHI techniques: (1) using user-guided rewrites based on follow-up responses, and (2) employing persona-based rewards linked to users' long-term interaction history.

Result: Models trained via RLHI performed better in personalization, instruction-following, and reasoning benchmarks compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: Natural human interaction provides scalable and effective supervision, enhancing personalized alignment in conversational AI models.

Abstract: We posit that to achieve continual model improvement and multifaceted
alignment, future models must learn from natural human interaction. Current
conversational models are aligned using pre-annotated, expert-generated human
feedback. In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Human
Interaction (RLHI), a paradigm that learns directly from in-the-wild user
conversations. We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided
Rewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users'
natural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which
learns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term
interaction history (termed persona). Together, these methods link long-term
user personas to turn-level preferences via persona-conditioned preference
optimization. Trained on conversations derived from WildChat, both RLHI
variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and
instruction-following, and similar feedback enhances performance on reasoning
benchmarks. These results suggest organic human interaction offers scalable,
effective supervision for personalized alignment.

*Yue Zhang,Tianyi Ma,Zun Wang,Yanyuan Qiao,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes improving Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents by combining textual descriptions from multiple perspectives with large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-and-Language Navigation agents are limited in understanding visual details or abstract semantics necessary for high-level reasoning.

Method: The approach integrates text-based analogical reasoning from multiple perspectives into the navigation task, enhancing scene understanding and spatial reasoning.

Result: The method significantly improves navigation performance on the R2R dataset.

Conclusion: Combining textual inputs with analogical reasoning substantially boosts the ability of VLN agents to make accurate navigation decisions.

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming
increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual
scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw
image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for
high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's
contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple
perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging
text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene
understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions.
We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in navigation performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReasoningBank introduces a memory framework enabling language model agents to learn from past experiences, guiding their interactions with better strategies for real-world tasks. The MaTTS mechanism amplifies this memory-driven learning by expanding interaction experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language model agents fail to learn from accumulated interaction history, repeating mistakes and discarding insights. This issue necessitates a solution for persistent real-world tasks.

Method: The authors propose ReasoningBank, a system that extracts reasoning strategies from successful and failed experiences, combined with memory-aware test-time scaling (MaTTS) to improve task performance via diverse and abundant experience generation.

Result: ReasoningBank consistently outperforms traditional memory mechanisms in web browsing and software engineering benchmarks by enhancing effectiveness and efficiency. MaTTS further boosts performance through better memory utilization.

Conclusion: Memory-driven experience scaling introduces a novel mechanism for large language model agents to become self-evolving with emergent behaviors, accelerating learning over time and improving task performance.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of large language model agents in persistent
real-world roles, they naturally encounter continuous streams of tasks. A key
limitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction
history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We
propose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable
reasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed
experiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from
ReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back,
enabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful
experience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling
(MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up
the agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task,
the agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive
signals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn
guides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory
and test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks,
ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store
raw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness
and efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish
memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to
self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise.

*Nicholas Budny,Kia Ghods,Declan Campbell,Raja Marjieh,Amogh Joshi,Sreejan Kumar,Jonathan D. Cohen,Taylor W. Webb,Thomas L. Griffiths*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Vision Language Models (VLMs) struggle with visually grounded serial processing, widening performance gaps with humans as tasks become more demanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why VLMs underperform compared to humans on simple visual reasoning tasks and identify visually grounded serial processing as a potential bottleneck.

Method: Human and VLM performance were compared across tasks in geometric reasoning, perceptual enumeration, and mental rotation, with varying serial processing demands.

Result: VLMs showed decreased accuracy correlated with increased human reaction times, indicating deficiencies in serial processing as tasks demanded greater complexity.

Conclusion: VLMs face a fundamental limitation in visually grounded serial reasoning, highlighting a key area for improvement to better align with human capabilities.

Abstract: Why do Vision Language Models (VLMs), despite success on standard benchmarks,
often fail to match human performance on surprisingly simple visual reasoning
tasks? While the underlying computational principles are still debated, we
hypothesize that a crucial factor is a deficit in visually-grounded serial
processing. To test this hypothesis, we compared human and VLM performance
across tasks designed to vary serial processing demands in three distinct
domains: geometric reasoning, perceptual enumeration, and mental rotation.
Tasks within each domain varied serial processing load by manipulating factors
such as geometric concept complexity, perceptual individuation load, and
transformation difficulty. Across all domains, our results revealed a
consistent pattern: decreased VLM accuracy was strongly correlated with
increased human reaction time (used as a proxy for serial processing load). As
tasks require more demanding serial processing -- whether composing concepts,
enumerating items, or performing mental transformations -- the VLM-human
performance gap widens reliably. These findings support our hypothesis,
indicating that limitations in serial, visually grounded reasoning represent a
fundamental bottleneck that distinguishes current VLMs from humans.

*FaQiang Qian,WeiKun Zhang,Ziliang Wang,Kang An,Xuhui Zheng,Liangjian Wen,Mengya Gao,Yong Dai,Yichao Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniAPL, a unified training framework to address the distributional mismatch in preference learning for LLM alignment, achieving superior performance to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the flaws in the standard sequential alignment pipeline of SFT and RL, which creates distributional mismatches, ungrounded RL updates, and lacks mutual regularization between data sources.

Method: The authors propose the UniAPL framework, which reframes alignment as a constrained optimization problem and adopts a unified training objective that combines SFT and preference data in mixed batches for dynamic alignment and mutual regularization.

Result: Experiments on instruction-following tasks using the Qwen3 model family demonstrate significant improvements in performance over traditional GRPO baselines, showing up to +5.77% gains and even outperforming teacher models in some cases.

Conclusion: UniAPL resolves the distributional mismatch problem in preference learning, achieves better behavioral alignment with expert demonstrations, and enhances LLM performance while offering a more efficient training process.

Abstract: Shaping powerful LLMs to be beneficial and safe is central to AI alignment.
We argue that post-training alignment is fundamentally a unified Preference
Learning problem, involving two modalities: demonstrated preferences (e.g.,
Supervised Fine-Tuning, SFT) and comparative preferences (e.g., Reinforcement
Learning, RL).The standard sequential pipeline-SFT followed by RL-is flawed due
to a critical distributional mismatch: SFT uses static expert data, but as the
policy evolves, its generation distribution drifts, making SFT knowledge
brittle. Subsequent RL then explores without direct access to the rich,
ground-truth knowledge in expert demonstrations, leading to inefficient,
ungrounded updates. This separation prevents mutual regularization between data
sources. To address this, we reframe alignment as a constrained optimization
problem and propose Unified Adversarial Preference Learning (UniAPL),a novel
framework that dynamically aligns the policy's distribution with the expert's.
UniAPL implements a single-stage unified training objective, jointly learning
from mixed batches of SFT and preference data. In every gradient step, dense
expert demonstrations directly ground and regularize online exploration,
inherently resolving distributional mismatch and maximizing data synergy.We
evaluate UniAPL on instruction-following tasks using Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507
as the teacher. Our models match or exceed strong GRPO baselines: +5.77% on
Qwen3-0.6B (matching a 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B,even outperforming the
teacher. Analyses of response length and log-probability distributions confirm
that UniAPL outputs closely mimic expert demonstrations, achieving both
stronger performance and better behavioral alignment.

*Dawei Li,Zhen Tan,Chengshuai Zhao,Bohan Jiang,Baixiang Huang,Pingchuan Ma,Abdullah Alnaibari,Kai Shu,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of detecting judgments produced by Large Language Models (LLMs) in sensitive contexts, introduces the task of judgment detection, and presents a novel model called J-Detector for effective detection based on interaction analysis between judgment scores and candidates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper highlights the risks associated with relying on LLM-generated judgments due to their inherent biases and vulnerabilities, especially in critical scenarios like academic peer reviewing where unbiased decisions are crucial.

Method: The researchers propose a formalized judgment detection task and introduce J-Detector, a neural detector that uses linguistic and LLM-enhanced features to link biases in LLM judgments to the properties of candidates. They also conduct experiments to assess effectiveness.

Result: Experiments show J-Detector's success in accurately detecting LLM-generated judgments by leveraging neural techniques and interpretability, while highlighting its ability to quantify biases in LLM judgments.

Conclusion: The study validates the effectiveness of judgment detection, particularly with J-Detector, and its utility for mitigating risks in scenarios dependent on fair and transparent judgment systems leveraging LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based judgments leverage powerful LLMs to
efficiently evaluate candidate content and provide judgment scores. However,
the inherent biases and vulnerabilities of LLM-generated judgments raise
concerns, underscoring the urgent need for distinguishing them in sensitive
scenarios like academic peer reviewing. In this work, we propose and formalize
the task of judgment detection and systematically investigate the detectability
of LLM-generated judgments. Unlike LLM-generated text detection, judgment
detection relies solely on judgment scores and candidates, reflecting
real-world scenarios where textual feedback is often unavailable in the
detection process. Our preliminary analysis shows that existing LLM-generated
text detection methods perform poorly given their incapability to capture the
interaction between judgment scores and candidate content -- an aspect crucial
for effective judgment detection. Inspired by this, we introduce
\textit{J-Detector}, a lightweight and transparent neural detector augmented
with explicitly extracted linguistic and LLM-enhanced features to link LLM
judges' biases with candidates' properties for accurate detection. Experiments
across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{J-Detector}
and show how its interpretability enables quantifying biases in LLM judges.
Finally, we analyze key factors affecting the detectability of LLM-generated
judgments and validate the practical utility of judgment detection in
real-world scenarios.

*Siwei Wang,Yifei Shen,Haoran Sun,Shi Feng,Shang-Hua Teng,Li Dong,Yaru Hao,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the theoretical underpinnings of reinforcement learning methods applied to large language models, exploring policy gradient and Q-learning approaches for planning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advance the understanding of why reinforcement learning methods, specifically policy gradient and Q-learning, improve planning in large language models, despite theoretical ambiguities.

Method: The authors utilize a graph-based abstraction to theoretically analyze supervised fine-tuning, policy gradient, and Q-learning, complemented by real-world benchmarking using the Blocksworld dataset.

Result: The study finds that while supervised fine-tuning can introduce spurious solutions, RL enhances planning through exploration. Policy gradient suffers from diversity collapse, whereas Q-learning retains diversity and is better suited for off-policy learning. Reward hacking challenges in Q-learning are noted as well.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of exploration in RL for effective generalization in planning tasks, the superiority of Q-learning in avoiding diversity collapse, and the critical role of reward design in practical RL applications.

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical
basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate
RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction,
focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical
analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce
co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning
primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling
better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity
collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even
after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key
advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We
further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward
hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world
planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in
practice.

### [135] [\textit{No One-Size-Fits-All}: A Workload-Driven Characterization of Bit-Parallel vs. Bit-Serial Data Layouts for Processing-using-Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22980)
*Jingyao Zhang,Elaheh Sadredini*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This study offers the first systematic analysis of Bit-Parallel (BP) and Bit-Serial (BS) architectures in Processing-in-Memory (PIM), showing that the choice of layout is workload-dependent, with BP being better for control-heavy tasks and BS excelling in parallel, low-precision AI computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the lack of systematic guidelines for choosing optimal PIM data layouts (BP or BS), as existing frameworks assume a one-size-fits-all approach, limiting architectural decisions.

Method: The authors developed iso-area, cycle-accurate models for BP and BS architectures and evaluated them using both fine-grained benchmarks (MIMDRAM) and large-scale real applications (PIMBench, e.g., VGG network).

Result: The analysis revealed that BP is optimal for control-flow-intensive and irregular tasks, while BS is better suited for massively parallel, low-precision workloads (common in AI).

Conclusion: The study challenges the universal applicability of a single PIM layout, instead providing workload-driven guidelines for selecting layouts and paving the way for hybrid PIM system designs.

Abstract: Processing-in-Memory (PIM) is a promising approach to overcoming the
memory-wall bottleneck. However, the PIM community has largely treated its two
fundamental data layouts, Bit-Parallel (BP) and Bit-Serial (BS), as if they
were interchangeable. This implicit "one-layout-fits-all" assumption, often
hard-coded into existing evaluation frameworks, creates a critical gap:
architects lack systematic, workload-driven guidelines for choosing the optimal
data layout for their target applications.
  To address this gap, this paper presents the first systematic,
workload-driven characterization of BP and BS PIM architectures. We develop
iso-area, cycle-accurate BP and BS PIM architectural models and conduct a
comprehensive evaluation using a diverse set of benchmarks. Our suite includes
both fine-grained microworkloads from MIMDRAM to isolate specific operational
characteristics, and large-scale applications from the PIMBench suite, such as
the VGG network, to represent realistic end-to-end workloads.
  Our results quantitatively demonstrate that no single layout is universally
superior; the optimal choice is strongly dependent on workload characteristics.
BP excels on control-flow-intensive tasks with irregular memory access
patterns, whereas BS shows substantial advantages in massively parallel,
low-precision (e.g., INT4/INT8) computations common in AI. Based on this
characterization, we distill a set of actionable design guidelines for
architects. This work challenges the prevailing one-size-fits-all view on PIM
data layouts and provides a principled foundation for designing
next-generation, workload-aware, and potentially hybrid PIM systems.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the E-HTC framework, enhancing accuracy and lowering power/area consumption for hardware accelerators. It features novel addition schemes and demonstrates significant improvements over prior designs in multiple test scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the accuracy loss and high-power/area consumption seen in existing Hybrid Temporal Computing (HTC) architectures due to their reliance on MUX-based scaled addition.

Method: Two addition schemes are developed: Exact Multiple-input Binary Accumulator (EMBA) for precise calculations and Deterministic Threshold-based Scaled Adder (DTSA) for scaled operations. These are integrated into a MAC unit accommodating different encoding styles.

Result: In unipolar mode, E-HTC achieved dramatic accuracy improvements (94% better RMSE) over MUX-based HTC while reducing power and area consumption significantly. Similar trends are observed for bipolar encoding, with major advancements in RMSE and efficiency. Robust results are also demonstrated in FIR and DCT/iDCT applications.

Conclusion: E-HTC provides a substantial step forward in accuracy, efficiency, and power reduction for ultra-low-power hardware accelerators, outperforming prior architectures in diverse applications.

Abstract: This paper presents an accuracy-enhanced Hybrid Temporal Computing (E-HTC)
framework for ultra-low-power hardware accelerators with deterministic
additions. Inspired by the recently proposed HTC architecture, which leverages
pulse-rate and temporal data encoding to reduce switching activity and energy
consumption but loses accuracy due to its multiplexer (MUX)-based scaled
addition, we propose two bitstream addition schemes: (1) an Exact
Multiple-input Binary Accumulator (EMBA), which performs precise binary
accumulation, and (2) a Deterministic Threshold-based Scaled Adder (DTSA),
which employs threshold logic for scaled addition. These adders are integrated
into a multiplier accumulator (MAC) unit supporting both unipolar and bipolar
encodings. To validate the framework, we implement two accelerators: a Finite
Impulse Response (FIR) filter and an 8-point Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT)/iDCT engine. Results on a 4x4 MAC show that, in unipolar mode, E-HTC
matches the RMSE of state-of-the-art Counter-Based Stochastic Computing (CBSC)
MAC, improves accuracy by 94% over MUX-based HTC, and reduces power and area by
23% and 7% compared to MUX-based HTC and 64% and 74% compared to CBSC. In
bipolar mode, E-HTC MAC achieves 2.09% RMSE -- an 83% improvement over
MUX-based HTC -- and approaches CBSC's 1.40% RMSE with area and power savings
of 28% and 43% vs. MUX-based HTC and about 76% vs. CBSC. In FIR experiments,
both E-HTC variants yield PSNR gains of 3--5 dB (30--45% RMSE reduction) while
saving 13% power and 3% area. For DCT/iDCT, E-HTC boosts PSNR by 10--13 dB
(70--75% RMSE reduction) while saving area and power over both MUX- and
CBSC-based designs.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Crypto-Near-Cache (CNC), a near-cache-slice computing paradigm to address performance and energy efficiency issues in post-quantum cryptographic algorithms caused by cache bandwidth bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transition to post-quantum cryptographic algorithms introduces performance inefficiencies and energy overheads due to longer public keys and signatures. The bottleneck in cache bandwidth necessitates the development of solutions that balance high performance and energy efficiency.

Method: The authors introduce Crypto-Near-Cache (CNC), which places SRAM arrays with bitline computing capabilities near cache slices, enabling higher internal bandwidth and reduced data movement. CNC also supports virtual addressing and includes an ISA extension for seamless integration.

Result: The CNC paradigm achieves significant improvements in performance and energy efficiency for post-quantum cryptographic algorithms by addressing cache bandwidth limitations.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed CNC paradigm provides an innovative, efficient, and system-integrative solution to accelerate post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, resolving external bandwidth constraints and enhancing energy efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in post-quantum cryptographic algorithms have led to
their standardization by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) to safeguard information security in the post-quantum era. These
algorithms, however, employ public keys and signatures that are 3 to 9$\times$
longer than those used in pre-quantum cryptography, resulting in significant
performance and energy efficiency overheads. A critical bottleneck identified
in our analysis is the cache bandwidth. This limitation motivates the adoption
of on-chip in-/near-cache computing, a computing paradigm that offers
high-performance, exceptional energy efficiency, and flexibility to accelerate
post-quantum cryptographic algorithms. Our analysis of existing works reveals
challenges in integrating in-/near-cache computing into modern computer systems
and performance limitations due to external bandwidth limitation, highlighting
the need for innovative solutions that can seamlessly integrate into existing
systems without performance and energy efficiency issues. In this paper, we
introduce a near-cache-slice computing paradigm with support of customization
and virtual address, named Crypto-Near-Cache (CNC), designed to accelerate
post-quantum cryptographic algorithms and other applications. By placing SRAM
arrays with bitline computing capability near cache slices, high internal
bandwidth and short data movement are achieved with native support of virtual
addressing. An ISA extension to facilitate CNC is also proposed, with detailed
discussion on the implementation aspects of the core/cache datapath.

*Hongqin Lyu,Yonghao Wang,Yunlin Du,Mingyu Shi,Zhiteng Chao,Wenxing Li,Tiancheng Wang,Huawei Li*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces AssertGen, a framework for automatically generating SystemVerilog assertions (SVA) using an LLM-based approach. It improves assertion accuracy by extracting verification objectives, linking them to RTL signal chains, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on key testing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Large Language Model-based assertion generation methods fail to effectively correlate design specifications with RTL designs, resulting in subpar assertion quality.

Method: The proposed AssertGen uses a chain-of-thought (CoT) strategy to extract verification objectives from specifications, establishes cross-layer signal chains between objectives and RTL code, and employs an LLM to generate SystemVerilog assertions.

Result: Experimental results show that AssertGen achieves superior performance compared to existing methods in terms of formal property verification, cone of influence, proof core, and mutation testing coverage.

Conclusion: AssertGen successfully addresses the challenge of linking specifications to RTL designs for more precise assertion generation and sets a new standard of performance in the domain.

Abstract: Assertion-based verification (ABV) serves as a crucial technique for ensuring
that register-transfer level (RTL) designs adhere to their specifications.
While Large Language Model (LLM) aided assertion generation approaches have
recently achieved remarkable progress, existing methods are still unable to
effectively identify the relationship between design specifications and RTL
designs, which leads to the insufficiency of the generated assertions. To
address this issue, we propose AssertGen, an assertion generation framework
that automatically generates SystemVerilog assertions (SVA). AssertGen first
extracts verification objectives from specifications using a chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning strategy, then bridges corresponding signals between these
objectives and the RTL code to construct a cross-layer signal chain, and
finally generates SVAs based on the LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that
AssertGen outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods across several key
metrics, such as pass rate of formal property verification (FPV), cone of
influence (COI), proof core and mutation testing coverage.

TL;DR: The paper explores various designs and placements of hardware compression and decompression units (CDPUs) for datacenter efficiency, analyzing an in-storage ASIC-based CDPU against leading accelerators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational burdens imposed by lossless compression on datacenter CPUs and the need to optimize CDPU selection, design, and placement.

Method: The researchers designed an ASIC-based in-storage CDPU and conducted a comprehensive evaluation across three placement regimes: peripheral, on-chip, and in-storage, comparing it with Intel QAT accelerators.

Result: The study found key factors like throughput and latency sensitivity to placement, correlations with data patterns, mismatches in benchmarks vs. real-world gains, power efficiency discrepancies, and scalability issues.

Conclusion: A cross-layer, placement-aware approach is essential for optimizing hardware (de)compression for hyperscale storage systems.

Abstract: Lossless compression imposes significant computational over head on
datacenters when performed on CPUs. Hardware compression and decompression
processing units (CDPUs) can alleviate this overhead, but optimal algorithm
selection, microarchitectural design, and system-level placement of CDPUs are
still not well understood. We present the design of an ASIC-based in-storage
CDPU and provide a comprehensive end-to-end evaluation against two leading ASIC
accelerators, Intel QAT 8970 and QAT 4xxx. The evaluation spans three dominant
CDPU placement regimes: peripheral, on-chip, and in-storage. Our results
reveal: (i) acute sensitivity of throughput and latency to CDPU placement and
interconnection, (ii) strong correlation between compression efficiency and
data patterns/layouts, (iii) placement-driven divergences between
microbenchmark gains and real-application speedups, (iv) discrepancies between
module and system-level power efficiency, and (v) scalability and multi-tenant
interference is sues of various CDPUs. These findings motivate a
placement-aware, cross-layer rethinking of hardware (de)compression for
hyperscale storage infrastructures.

*Hongqin Lyu,Yunlin Du,Yonghao Wang,Zhiteng Chao,Tiancheng Wang,Huawei Li*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces AssertFix, a framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to automatically fix incorrect SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs), improving assertion quality and verification coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual writing and maintenance of SystemVerilog Assertions are prone to errors, and existing LLM-based assertion-generation methods leave the burden of fixing errors to users, limiting their applicability.

Method: AssertFix combines LLMs with a process that systematically locates problematic RTL code, identifies root causes, classifies error types, and applies tailored fix strategies to correct assertion errors.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that AssertFix achieves significant improvements in both fix rate and verification coverage using Opencore benchmarks.

Conclusion: AssertFix enhances the practicality of assertion-based verification by automating the correction of assertion errors, thereby advancing quality and coverage in RTL design verification.

Abstract: Assertion-based verification (ABV) is critical in ensuring that
register-transfer level (RTL) designs conform to their functional
specifications. SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) effectively specify design
properties, but writing and maintaining them manually is challenging and
error-prone. Although recent progress of assertion generation methods
leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in improving
assertion quality, they typically treat assertion generation as a final step,
leaving the burden of fixing of the incorrect assertions to human effects,
which may significantly limits the application of these methods. To address the
above limitation, we propose an automatic assertion fix framework based on
LLMs, named AssertFix. AsserFix accurately locates the RTL code related to the
incorrect assertion, systematically identifies the root causes of the assertion
errors, classifies the error type and finally applies dedicated fix strategies
to automatically correct these errors, improving the overall quality of the
generated assertions. Experimental results show that AssertFix achieves
noticeable improvements in both fix rate and verification coverage across the
Opencore benchmarks.

Motivation: With the rising complexity of SoC architectures, on-chip communication buses are becoming critical attack vectors for fault injection threats.

Method: Simulation-driven fault injection was performed across three mainstream bus protocols (Wishbone, AXI Lite, AXI), analyzing success rates, spatial distributions, and timing dependencies.

Result: Consistent patterns of fault interactions with bus transactions were identified across the protocols, revealing vulnerabilities and providing insights.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to better attack modeling and the design of more resilient System on Chip architectures.

Abstract: Fault injection attacks exploit physical disturbances to compromise the
functionality and security of integrated circuits. As System on Chip (SoC)
architectures grow in complexity, the vulnerability of on chip communication
fabrics has become increasingly prominent. Buses, serving as interconnects
among various IP cores, represent potential vectors for fault-based
exploitation. In this study, we perform simulation-driven fault injection
across three mainstream bus protocols Wishbone, AXI Lite, and AXI. We
systematically examine fault success rates, spatial vulnerability
distributions, and timing dependencies to characterize how faults interact with
bus-level transactions. The results uncover consistent behavioral patterns
across protocols, offering practical insights for both attack modeling and the
development of resilient SoC designs.

### [142] [Are you sure? Measuring models bias in content moderation through uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22699)
*Alessandra Urbinati,Mirko Lai,Simona Frenda,Marco Antonio Stranisci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an unsupervised approach to measure model fairness in content moderation using uncertainty metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media content moderation using language models often perpetuates racial and social biases, raising fairness concerns.

Method: The study uses conformal prediction-based uncertainty as a proxy to benchmark language models against messages labeled by vulnerable groups.

Result: Models often achieve high classification accuracy for minority groups' labels but with low confidence, revealing representation gaps.

Conclusion: Confidence measurements can help identify bias and guide debiasing processes in pre-trained models before deployment.

Abstract: Automatic content moderation is crucial to ensuring safety in social media.
Language Model-based classifiers are being increasingly adopted for this task,
but it has been shown that they perpetuate racial and social biases. Even if
several resources and benchmark corpora have been developed to challenge this
issue, measuring the fairness of models in content moderation remains an open
issue. In this work, we present an unsupervised approach that benchmarks models
on the basis of their uncertainty in classifying messages annotated by people
belonging to vulnerable groups. We use uncertainty, computed by means of the
conformal prediction technique, as a proxy to analyze the bias of 11 models
against women and non-white annotators and observe to what extent it diverges
from metrics based on performance, such as the $F_1$ score. The results show
that some pre-trained models predict with high accuracy the labels coming from
minority groups, even if the confidence in their prediction is low. Therefore,
by measuring the confidence of models, we are able to see which groups of
annotators are better represented in pre-trained models and lead the debiasing
process of these models before their effective use.

### [143] [AccessEval: Benchmarking Disability Bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22703)
*Srikant Panda,Amit Agarwal,Hitesh Laxmichand Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AccessEval is a benchmark evaluating biases in 21 Language Models against disability-aware queries, revealing ableist tendencies and variations in responses across domains and disability types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to systematically investigate disparities in Large Language Model responses, especially focusing on biases related to disabilities.

Method: The authors created AccessEval, a benchmark using paired Neutral and Disability-Aware queries across 6 domains and 9 disability types. Metrics for sentiment, social perception, and factual accuracy were employed.

Result: The analysis revealed biases where disability-aware queries had negative tones, increased stereotyping, and higher factual inaccuracies, with disproportionate effects on hearing, speech, and mobility-related disabilities.

Conclusion: The study underscores the harmful real-world implications of embedded ableism in language models and emphasizes the need for improved bias mitigation strategies in AI applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse domains
but often exhibit disparities in how they handle real-life queries. To
systematically investigate these effects within various disability contexts, we
introduce \textbf{AccessEval (Accessibility Evaluation)}, a benchmark
evaluating 21 closed- and open-source LLMs across 6 real-world domains and 9
disability types using paired Neutral and Disability-Aware Queries. We
evaluated model outputs with metrics for sentiment, social perception, and
factual accuracy.
  Our analysis reveals that responses to disability-aware queries tend to have
a more negative tone, increased stereotyping, and higher factual error compared
to neutral queries. These effects show notable variation by domain and
disability type, with disabilities affecting hearing, speech, and mobility
disproportionately impacted. These disparities reflect persistent forms of
ableism embedded in model behavior.
  By examining model performance in real-world decision-making contexts, we
better illuminate how such biases can translate into tangible harms for
disabled users. This framing helps bridges the gap between technical evaluation
and user impact, reinforcing importance of bias mitigation in day-to-day
applications. Our dataset is publicly available at:

### [144] [RAR$^2$: Retrieval-Augmented Medical Reasoning via Thought-Driven Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22713)
*Kaishuai Xu,Wenjun Hou,Yi Cheng,Wenjie Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAR$^2$ enhances biomedical question answering through joint Reasoning-Augmented Retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning, surpassing standard RAG approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods struggle to address complex medical questions due to limited reasoning, which hampers the retrieval and integration of clinically relevant information.

Method: RAR$^2$ introduces a joint learning framework combining Reasoning-Augmented Retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning. It employs a thought process to guide retrieval and answer generation, supported by a mixed preference training dataset and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Result: RAR$^2$ demonstrates superior performance over traditional RAG methods on various biomedical question-answering datasets, even without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: RAR$^2$ effectively bridges reasoning and retrieval, providing a promising approach to address limitations in existing RAG methods for biomedical question answering.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance on diverse
medical benchmarks, highlighting their potential in supporting real-world
clinical tasks. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a key
approach for mitigating knowledge gaps and hallucinations by incorporating
external medical information. However, RAG still struggles with complex medical
questions that require intensive reasoning, as surface-level input often fails
to reflect the true knowledge needs of the task. Existing methods typically
focus on refining queries without explicitly modeling the reasoning process,
limiting their ability to retrieve and integrate clinically relevant knowledge.
In this work, we propose RAR$^2$, a joint learning framework that improves both
Reasoning-Augmented Retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning. RAR$^2$
constructs a thought process to uncover implicit knowledge requirements and
uses it to guide retrieval and answer generation. We build a training dataset
of mixed preference pairs and apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to
train the model. Moreover, we design two test-time scaling strategies to
explore the boundaries of our framework. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAR$^2$ across several biomedical question answering datasets,
outperforming RAG baselines with or without fine-tuning.

### [145] [TRUEBench: Can LLM Response Meet Real-world Constraints as Productivity Assistant?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22715)
*Jiho Park,Jongyoon Song,Minjin Choi,Kyuho Heo,Taehun Huh,Ji Won Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRUEBench is a benchmark designed to rigorously assess large language models (LLMs) in productivity-oriented tasks with a focus on multilinguality, implicit constraints, and complex multi-turn dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs fail to evaluate their real-world capabilities effectively due to lack of multilinguality, inability to capture implicit constraints, and exclusion of multi-turn dialogues.

Method: TRUEBench incorporates multilingual instructions across 12 languages, evaluates implicit and explicit constraints, and tests complex multi-turn dialogue scenarios with accumulating constraints and context switches. An LLM validator is used to refine evaluation criteria.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal that TRUEBench is more challenging than existing benchmarks, with OpenAI’s model achieving a modest pass rate of only 69.07%.

Conclusion: TRUEBench provides a realistic and demanding framework for assessing LLMs in productivity settings, exposing both their capabilities and limitations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integral as productivity
assistants, but existing benchmarks fall short in rigorously evaluating their
real-world instruction-following capabilities. Current benchmarks often (i)
lack sufficient multilinguality, (ii) fail to capture the implicit constraints
inherent in user requests, and (iii) overlook the complexities of multi-turn
dialogue. To address these critical gaps and provide a more realistic
assessment, we introduce TRUEBench (Trustworthy Real-world Usage Evaluation
Benchmark)1, a novel benchmark specifically designed for LLM-based productivity
assistants. TRUEBench distinguishes itself by featuring input prompts across 12
languages, incorporating intra-instance multilingual instructions, employing
rigorous evaluation criteria to capture both explicit and implicit constraints,
and including complex multi-turn dialogue scenarios with both accumulating
constraints and context switches. Furthermore, to ensure reliability in
evaluation, we refined constraints using an LLM validator. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TRUEBench presents significantly greater
challenges than existing benchmarks; for instance, a strong model like OpenAI
o1 achieved only a 69.07% overall pass rate. TRUEBench offers a demanding and
realistic assessment of LLMs in practical productivity settings, highlighting
their capabilities and limitations.

### [146] [Multi-Modal Sentiment Analysis with Dynamic Attention Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22729)
*Sadia Abdulhalim,Muaz Albaghdadi,Moshiur Farazi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Dynamic Attention Fusion (DAF) framework to improve sentiment analysis using both text and acoustic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sentiment analysis relying solely on text ignores vital non-verbal cues like vocal tone and prosody, which are essential for understanding emotional intent.

Method: DAF integrates frozen text embeddings from pretrained language models and acoustic features from speech encoders using an adaptive attention mechanism that dynamically weights each modality per utterance.

Result: The DAF model outperforms static fusion and unimodal baselines in sentiment prediction, showing significant F1-score improvements, reduced prediction errors, and validation through comprehensive ablation studies.

Conclusion: By leveraging both verbal and non-verbal cues, DAF enhances sentiment prediction reliability, with potential applications in emotion recognition, mental health assessment, and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Traditional sentiment analysis has long been a unimodal task, relying solely
on text. This approach overlooks non-verbal cues such as vocal tone and prosody
that are essential for capturing true emotional intent. We introduce Dynamic
Attention Fusion (DAF), a lightweight framework that combines frozen text
embeddings from a pretrained language model with acoustic features from a
speech encoder, using an adaptive attention mechanism to weight each modality
per utterance. Without any finetuning of the underlying encoders, our proposed
DAF model consistently outperforms both static fusion and unimodal baselines on
a large multimodal benchmark. We report notable gains in F1-score and
reductions in prediction error and perform a variety of ablation studies that
support our hypothesis that the dynamic weighting strategy is crucial for
modeling emotionally complex inputs. By effectively integrating verbal and
non-verbal information, our approach offers a more robust foundation for
sentiment prediction and carries broader impact for affective computing
applications -- from emotion recognition and mental health assessment to more
natural human computer interaction.

### [147] [TF-Bench: Evaluating Program Semantics Reasoning with Type Inference in System F](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23686)
*Yifeng He,Luning Yang,Christopher Castro Gaw Gonzalo,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TF-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' type inference reasoning ability in System F, emphasizing semantic understanding. Results show state-of-the-art models struggle in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for code reasoning fail to adequately assess semantic reasoning in LLMs and rely too much on superficial correlations between language and code.

Method: Developed TF-Bench, a type inference benchmark in System F with a variant TF-Bench_pure focused on semantics by removing irrelevant language. Two new metrics were also introduced to evaluate robustness and reasoning effectiveness.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs like Claude-3.7-sonnet showed only 55.85% accuracy on the semantic-focused TF-Bench_pure, revealing significant gaps in semantic reasoning.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit considerable limitations in true program semantics reasoning, necessitating refined benchmarks and targeted research to enhance their capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into the software
engineering ecosystem. Their test-time compute (TTC) reasoning capabilities
show significant potential for understanding program logic and semantics beyond
mere token recognition. However, current benchmarks for code reasoning lack a
formal, program-centric deductive framework to ensure sound evaluation, and are
incapable of assessing whether models genuinely reason about program semantics
or merely exploit superficial associations between natural language and code
tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce TF-Bench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate LLM reasoning based on type inference in System F, a task we refer to
as program semantics reasoning. By employing verified transformations to remove
semantically irrelevant natural language, we construct TF-Bench_pure, a purely
semantics-driven variant of TF-Bench. Our analysis reveals substantial
limitations in state-of-the-art LLMs, with the best-performing LLM
(Claude-3.7-sonnet) achieving only 55.85% accuracy on TF-Bench_pure.
Additionally, we propose two novel metrics to assess robustness and the
effectiveness of test-time reasoning, underscoring critical limitations in
current LLM capabilities and highlighting essential directions for future
research.

### [148] [Enabling Approximate Joint Sampling in Diffusion LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22738)
*Parikshit Bansal,Sujay Sanghavi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new sampler for diffusion-based language models that allows for approximately sampling multiple tokens at once, improving the balance between accuracy and generation speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in masked diffusion language models that arises when unmasking multiple tokens in parallel, which leads to inaccuracies in the true joint distribution.

Method: The authors introduce a lightweight sampler layer that works on top of an existing diffusion language model. By training this sampler to mimic exact joint sampling, it allows multiple tokens to be unmasked after a single pass of the main diffusion model.

Result: The proposed method achieves a high MAUVE score of 0.87, significantly improving over the baseline of 0.31, indicating effective approximate joint sampling for both general and task-specific language modeling.

Conclusion: The new sampler demonstrates the potential to balance faster text generation with higher fidelity to the underlying joint distribution, making it viable for applications in tasks like language modeling and coding.

Abstract: In autoregressive language models, each token is sampled by conditioning on
all the past tokens; the overall string has thus been sampled from the correct
underlying joint distribution represented by the model. In contrast, masked
diffusion language models generate text by unmasking tokens out of order and
potentially in parallel. Generating an overall string sampled from the correct
underlying joint distribution would (again) require exactly one token unmasking
in every full-model forward pass. The more tokens unmasked in parallel, the
further away the string is from the true joint; this can be seen in the
resulting drop in accuracy (but, increase in speed). In this paper we devise a
way to {\em approximately} sample multiple tokens from the joint distribution
in a single full-model forward pass; we do so by developing a new lightweight
single-layer ``sampler" on top of an existing large diffusion LM. One forward
pass of the full model can now be followed by multiple forward passes of only
this sampler layer, to yield multiple unmasked tokens. Our sampler is trained
to mimic exact joint sampling from the (frozen) full model. We show the
effectiveness of our approximate joint sampling for both pretrained-only
(Dream-7B-Base) and instruction-tuned (Dream-7B-Instruct) models on language
modeling and math \& coding tasks. When four tokens are unmasked for each
full-model denoising step, our sampling algorithm achieves a MAUVE score of
0.87 (vs marginal baseline of 0.31) with respect to the true joint
distribution.

### [149] [Painless Activation Steering: An Automated, Lightweight Approach for Post-Training Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22739)
*Sasha Cui,Zhongren Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Painless Activation Steering (PAS), an automated and efficient post-training method for language models that improves behavioral tasks without manual intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-training methods for language models are either expensive and time-consuming (weight-based steering) or imprecise and labor-intensive (prompt-based steering and manual techniques). There is a need for a controllable, efficient, and automated alternative.

Method: The authors present Painless Activation Steering (PAS), which automates activation steering using labeled datasets without requiring human intervention, prompt creation, or feature labeling. PAS includes introspective variants (iPAS) and delivers lightweight activation vectors for steering language models.

Result: PAS showed reliable improvement for behavioral tasks across three language models and 18 tasks. The introspective variant (iPAS) demonstrated strong steering effects, delivering up to 34.8% improvement in alignment. PAS also provided additional benefits alongside In-Context Learning (ICL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).

Conclusion: PAS provides a practical, cheap, and efficient automated method for steering language model behavior, defining areas where activation steering excels and fails, and enhancing existing techniques like ICL and SFT.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are typically post-trained for desired capabilities and
behaviors via weight-based or prompt-based steering, but the former is
time-consuming and expensive, and the latter is not precisely controllable and
often requires manual trial-and-error. While activation steering (AS) promises
a cheap, fast, and controllable alternative to the two existing post-training
methods, current AS techniques require hand-crafted prompt pairs or
labor-intensive feature annotation, making them more inconvenient than the
plug-and-play methods such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). We introduce Painless Activation Steering (PAS), a family of
fully automated methods that make AS readily usable with any given labeled
dataset, with no need for prompt construction, feature labeling, or human
intervention. We evaluate PAS on three open-weight models
(Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-8B, and Nous-Hermes-2) and 18 tasks;
we find that PAS reliably improves performance for behavior tasks, but not for
intelligence-oriented tasks. The introspective variant (iPAS) delivers the
strongest causal steering effects (10.1% on Bias, 5.2% on Morality, and 34.8%
on Alignment). We also show PAS delivers additional gains on top of In-Context
Learning (ICL) and SFT. PAS constructs a fast, lightweight activation vector
that can be cheaply trained, easily stored, and activated at will. Our results
provide a characterization of where AS helps, where it fails, and how to deploy
it as a practical, automated LM post-training option.

### [150] [MIRAGE: Multi-hop Reasoning with Ambiguity Evaluation for Illusory Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22750)
*Jeonghyun Park,Ingeol Baek,Seunghyun Yoon,Haeun Jang,Aparna Garimella,Akriti Jain,Nedim Lipka,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the complexity of multi-hop question answering due to embedded ambiguity, introducing a new benchmark called MIRAGE and proposing the CLARION framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenge posed by multi-hop QA ambiguity, where models fail in reasoning through multiple layers of intertwined ambiguity.

Method: The authors introduce MIRAGE, a curated benchmark of ambiguous multi-hop questions, and propose CLARION, a multi-agent framework focusing on clarifying ambiguity at each reasoning step.

Result: Their experiments show that current models perform poorly on MIRAGE, while CLARION significantly advances performance in resolving multi-hop ambiguity.

Conclusion: Resolving ambiguity in multi-hop QA is critical, and CLARION offers a promising direction for developing more robust reasoning systems.

Abstract: Real-world Multi-hop Question Answering (QA) often involves ambiguity that is
inseparable from the reasoning process itself. This ambiguity creates a
distinct challenge, where multiple reasoning paths emerge from a single
question, each requiring independent resolution. Since each sub-question is
ambiguous, the model must resolve ambiguity at every step. Thus, answering a
single question requires handling multiple layers of ambiguity throughout the
reasoning chain. We find that current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle in
this setting, typically exploring wrong reasoning paths and producing
incomplete answers. To facilitate research on multi-hop ambiguity, we introduce
MultI-hop Reasoning with AmbiGuity Evaluation for Illusory Questions (MIRAGE),
a benchmark designed to analyze and evaluate this challenging intersection of
ambiguity interpretation and multi-hop reasoning. MIRAGE contains 1,142
high-quality examples of ambiguous multi-hop questions, categorized under a
taxonomy of syntactic, general, and semantic ambiguity, and curated through a
rigorous multi-LLM verification pipeline. Our experiments reveal that even
state-of-the-art models struggle on MIRAGE, confirming that resolving ambiguity
combined with multi-step inference is a distinct and significant challenge. To
establish a robust baseline, we propose CLarifying Ambiguity with a Reasoning
and InstructiON (CLARION), a multi-agent framework that significantly
outperforms existing approaches on MIRAGE, paving the way for more adaptive and
robust reasoning systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ML2B, the first multilingual benchmark for evaluating machine learning (ML) code generation in multiple languages beyond English, revealing a sharp performance drop in non-English tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ML code generation benchmarks are primarily focused on English, ignoring the need for multilingual support in the global ML community.

Method: The authors designed ML2B, a benchmark with 30 translated Kaggle competitions in 13 languages, providing structured metadata and validated human-reviewed translations. They evaluated with the automated AIDE framework.

Result: Performance of ML models in multilingual contexts shows a significant degradation of 15-45% on non-English tasks compared to English.

Conclusion: ML2B highlights the need for improving multilingual representation learning in ML code generation, offering resources to drive progress in this area.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
in generating machine learning (ML) code, enabling end-to-end pipeline
construction from natural language instructions. However, existing benchmarks
for ML code generation are mainly restricted to English, overlooking the global
and multilingual nature of ML research and practice. To address this gap, we
present ML2B, the first benchmark for evaluating multilingual ML code
generation. ML2B consists of 30 Kaggle competitions translated into 13 natural
languages, covering tabular, text, and image data types, with structured
metadata and validated human-reviewed translations. For evaluation, we employ
AIDE, an automated framework for end-to-end assessment of data science
pipelines, and provide insights into cross-lingual model performance. Our
results reveal substantial 15-45% performance degradation on non-English tasks,
highlighting critical challenges in multilingual representation learning for
code generation. The benchmark, evaluation framework, and comprehensive results
are made available through our GitHub repository to facilitate future research
in multilingual ML code generation: https://github.com/enaix/ml2b.

### [152] [Estimating the strength and timing of syntactic structure building in naturalistic reading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23195)
*Nan Wang,Jiaxuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the timing of syntactic processes in sentence comprehension using eye-tracking and EEG data under natural reading conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the conflation of syntactic category detection and phrase structure construction in psycholinguistic research, and explore their temporal order.

Method: Utilize EEG and eye-tracking data from the ZuCo corpus, analyze gaze transitions, apply Bayesian network modeling, and measure fixation-related potentials.

Result: The study demonstrates that fixation preferentially moves between syntactic heads, structural depth drives reading deviations, and syntactic processes influence neural activity before word onset and during early integration.

Conclusion: Phrase structure construction can precede category detection, suggesting a predictive tree-scaffolding mechanism dominates lexical influences in sentence comprehension.

Abstract: A central question in psycholinguistics is the timing of syntax in sentence
processing. Much of the existing evidence comes from violation paradigms, which
conflate two separable processes - syntactic category detection and phrase
structure construction - and implicitly assume that phrase structure follows
category detection. In this study, we use co-registered EEG and eye-tracking
data from the ZuCo corpus to disentangle these processes and test their
temporal order under naturalistic reading conditions. Analyses of gaze
transitions showed that readers preferentially moved between syntactic heads,
suggesting that phrase structures, rather than serial word order, organize
scanpaths. Bayesian network modeling further revealed that structural depth was
the strongest driver of deviations from linear reading, outweighing lexical
familiarity and surprisal. Finally, fixation-related potentials demonstrated
that syntactic surprisal influences neural activity before word onset (-184 to
-10 ms) and during early integration (48 to 300 ms). These findings extend
current models of syntactic timing by showing that phrase structure
construction can precede category detection and dominate lexical influences,
supporting a predictive "tree-scaffolding" account of comprehension.

*Mohamed Maged,Alhassan Ehab,Ali Mekky,Besher Hassan,Shady Shehata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Generative text-to-speech technology poses challenges in distinguishing real and synthetic Arabic speech. Researchers created a multi-dialect Arabic spoofed speech dataset and evaluated synthesis models to identify the most realistic outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the lack of focus on Arabic languages and dialects in spoofed speech detection, given that most prior efforts target English.

Method: The study involves compiling a multi-dialect Arabic spoofed speech dataset, evaluating synthesis models using classifiers, machine learning algorithms, an automatic speech recognition model, and human ratings.

Result: FishSpeech emerged as the best-performing TTS model for Arabic voice cloning, producing highly realistic synthetic speech based on evaluation on the Casablanca corpus.

Conclusion: While FishSpeech is highly effective, relying solely on it for dataset creation could reduce the model's generalizability.

Abstract: With the rise of generative text-to-speech models, distinguishing between
real and synthetic speech has become challenging, especially for Arabic that
have received limited research attention. Most spoof detection efforts have
focused on English, leaving a significant gap for Arabic and its many dialects.
In this work, we introduce the first multi-dialect Arabic spoofed speech
dataset. To evaluate the difficulty of the synthesized audio from each model
and determine which produces the most challenging samples, we aimed to guide
the construction of our final dataset either by merging audios from multiple
models or by selecting the best-performing model, we conducted an evaluation
pipeline that included training classifiers using two approaches: modern
embedding-based methods combined with classifier heads; classical machine
learning algorithms applied to MFCC features; and the RawNet2 architecture. The
pipeline further incorporated the calculation of Mean Opinion Score based on
human ratings, as well as processing both original and synthesized datasets
through an Automatic Speech Recognition model to measure the Word Error Rate.
Our results demonstrate that FishSpeech outperforms other TTS models in Arabic
voice cloning on the Casablanca corpus, producing more realistic and
challenging synthetic speech samples. However, relying on a single TTS for
dataset creation may limit generalizability.

*Kai Zhang,Christopher Malon,Lichao Sun,Martin Renqiang Min*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces EditGRPO, a mixed-policy reinforcement learning method to improve radiology report generation through clinically motivated rewards, showing significant performance and generalization gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in radiology report generation, where existing MLLMs lack alignment with clinical efficacy despite showing improved performance. This requires advanced analysis, reasoning, and accurate text generation catered to clinical needs.

Method: The authors develop EditGRPO, a mixed-policy RL algorithm combining on-policy exploration and off-policy guidance with sentence-level corrections during training rollouts. This approach improves exploration efficiency and sampling effectiveness.

Result: EditGRPO, when applied to a Qwen2.5-VL-3B MLLM pre-trained with SFT, achieves a 3.4% average improvement in key evaluation metrics on four datasets and a 5.9% performance gain on unseen datasets, surpassing both SFT and GRPO baselines.

Conclusion: EditGRPO effectively enhances radiology report generation by optimizing for clinically relevant outcomes, offering better performance and robust out-of-domain generalization, addressing critical limitations in the application of MLLMs in healthcare.

Abstract: Radiology report generation requires advanced medical image analysis,
effective temporal reasoning, and accurate text generation. Although recent
innovations, particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), have shown
improved performance, their supervised fine-tuning (SFT) objective is not
explicitly aligned with clinical efficacy. In this work, we introduce EditGRPO,
a mixed-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed specifically to
optimize the generation through clinically motivated rewards. EditGRPO
integrates on-policy exploration with off-policy guidance by injecting
sentence-level detailed corrections during training rollouts. This mixed-policy
approach addresses the exploration dilemma and sampling efficiency issues
typically encountered in RL. Applied to a Qwen2.5-VL-3B MLLM initialized with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), EditGRPO outperforms both SFT and vanilla GRPO
baselines, achieving an average improvement of 3.4% in CheXbert, GREEN,
Radgraph, and RATEScore metrics across four major chest X-ray report generation
datasets. Notably, EditGRPO also demonstrates superior out-of-domain
generalization, with an average performance gain of 5.9% on unseen datasets.

### [155] [Critique-Coder: Enhancing Coder Models by Critique Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22824)
*Chi Ruan,Dongfu Jiang,Yubo Wang,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Critique Reinforcement Learning (CRL) and Critique-Coder, combining RL and CRL to improve reasoning and critique generation in LLMs, outperforming RL-only models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL for reasoning models lacks explicit mechanisms for critique and reflection, motivating the need for Critique Reinforcement Learning (CRL).

Method: CRL tasks models with generating critiques for (question, solution) pairs, rewarding alignment with ground-truth judgment labels. Critique-Coder combines RL and CRL by using 20% CRL data in training.

Result: Critique-Coder significantly outperforms RL-only models in reasoning benchmarks, including LiveCodeBench (v5) and logic reasoning tasks from the BBEH dataset.

Conclusion: CRL enhances general reasoning and critique abilities, making it a strong complement to standard RL for reasoning tasks in LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a popular training paradigm,
particularly when paired with reasoning models. While effective, it primarily
focuses on generating responses and lacks mechanisms to explicitly foster
critique or reflection. Several recent studies, like Critique-Fine-Tuning (CFT)
and Critique-Guided-Distillation (CGD) have shown the benefits of explicitly
teaching LLMs how to critique. Motivated by them, we propose Critique
Reinforcement Learning (CRL), where the model is tasked with generating a
critique for a given (question, solution) pair. The reward is determined solely
by whether the final judgment label $c \in \{\texttt{True}, \texttt{False}\}$
of the generated critique aligns with the ground-truth judgment $c^*$. Building
on this point, we introduce \textsc{Critique-Coder}, which is trained on a
hybrid of RL and CRL by substituting 20\% of the standard RL data with CRL
data. We fine-tune multiple models (\textsc{Critique-Coder}) and evaluate them
on different benchmarks to show their advantages over RL-only models. We show
that \textsc{Critique-Coder} consistently outperforms RL-only baselines on all
the evaluated benchmarks. Notably, our \textsc{Critique-Coder-8B} can reach
over 60\% on LiveCodeBench (v5), outperforming other reasoning models like
DeepCoder-14B and GPT-o1. Beyond code generation, \textsc{Critique-Coder} also
demonstrates enhanced general reasoning abilities, as evidenced by its better
performance on logic reasoning tasks from the BBEH dataset. This indicates that
the application of CRL on coding datasets enhances general reasoning and
critique abilities, which are transferable across a broad range of tasks.
Hence, we believe that CRL works as a great complement to standard RL for LLM
reasoning.

### [156] [ChatInject: Abusing Chat Templates for Prompt Injection in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22830)
*Hwan Chang,Yonghyun Jun,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based agents are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks, especially using structured chat templates and multi-turn dialogues, exposing critical weaknesses in current defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and exploit vulnerabilities in LLM-based agents, particularly focusing on their susceptibility to structured chat templates and contextual manipulation through conversations.

Method: The authors propose ChatInject, an attack that mimics native chat templates to inject malicious payloads and uses multi-turn dialogues to prime agents for executing harmful actions.

Result: Experimental results show ChatInject's significantly higher success rates compared to traditional prompt injections, effective across open and closed-source models, with multi-turn dialogues achieving a 52.33% success rate.

Conclusion: ChatInject unveils critical vulnerabilities in LLM agents, emphasizing the need for more robust defenses against structured and conversational attack vectors.

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language model (LLM) based agents that
interact with external environments has created new attack surfaces for
adversarial manipulation. One major threat is indirect prompt injection, where
attackers embed malicious instructions in external environment output, causing
agents to interpret and execute them as if they were legitimate prompts. While
previous research has focused primarily on plain-text injection attacks, we
find a significant yet underexplored vulnerability: LLMs' dependence on
structured chat templates and their susceptibility to contextual manipulation
through persuasive multi-turn dialogues. To this end, we introduce ChatInject,
an attack that formats malicious payloads to mimic native chat templates,
thereby exploiting the model's inherent instruction-following tendencies.
Building on this foundation, we develop a persuasion-driven Multi-turn variant
that primes the agent across conversational turns to accept and execute
otherwise suspicious actions. Through comprehensive experiments across frontier
LLMs, we demonstrate three critical findings: (1) ChatInject achieves
significantly higher average attack success rates than traditional prompt
injection methods, improving from 5.18% to 32.05% on AgentDojo and from 15.13%
to 45.90% on InjecAgent, with multi-turn dialogues showing particularly strong
performance at average 52.33% success rate on InjecAgent, (2)
chat-template-based payloads demonstrate strong transferability across models
and remain effective even against closed-source LLMs, despite their unknown
template structures, and (3) existing prompt-based defenses are largely
ineffective against this attack approach, especially against Multi-turn
variants. These findings highlight vulnerabilities in current agent systems.

### [157] [Toward Preference-aligned Large Language Models via Residual-based Model Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23982)
*Lucio La Cava,Andrea Tagarelli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes PaLRS, a training-free technique to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences using lightweight steering vectors derived from residual streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of existing preference alignment techniques, such as their need for curated data, computational expense, and task-specific rigidity.

Method: The authors developed PaLRS, which extracts steering vectors from residual streams in LLMs using minimal preference data and applies them at inference time for preferred behaviors.

Result: PaLRS exhibited consistent performance gains in areas like mathematical reasoning and code generation, outperforming DPO-aligned models with significant time savings.

Conclusion: PaLRS is presented as an efficient, flexible alternative for aligning LLMs with preferences, requiring minimal data and offering a plug-and-play solution.

Abstract: Preference alignment is a critical step in making Large Language Models
(LLMs) useful and aligned with (human) preferences. Existing approaches such as
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or Direct Preference Optimization
typically require curated data and expensive optimization over billions of
parameters, and eventually lead to persistent task-specific models. In this
work, we introduce Preference alignment of Large Language Models via Residual
Steering (PaLRS), a training-free method that exploits preference signals
encoded in the residual streams of LLMs. From as few as one hundred preference
pairs, PaLRS extracts lightweight, plug-and-play steering vectors that can be
applied at inference time to push models toward preferred behaviors. We
evaluate PaLRS on various small-to-medium-scale open-source LLMs, showing that
PaLRS-aligned models achieve consistent gains on mathematical reasoning and
code generation benchmarks while preserving baseline general-purpose
performance. Moreover, when compared to DPO-aligned models, they perform better
with huge time savings. Our findings highlight that PaLRS offers an effective,
much more efficient and flexible alternative to standard preference
optimization pipelines, offering a training-free, plug-and-play mechanism for
alignment with minimal data.

### [158] [Learning to Detect Relevant Contexts and Knowledge for Response Selection in Retrieval-based Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22845)
*Kai Hua,Zhiyuan Feng,Chongyang Tao,Rui Yan,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new multi-turn response selection model (RSM-DCK) that selectively detects relevant parts of conversation context and knowledge to improve response matching performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of excessive irrelevant information in dialogue contexts and knowledge bases, which leads to inferior performance in knowledge-grounded dialogue systems.

Method: The proposed model (RSM-DCK) involves three stages. First, it pre-selects relevant parts of the context and knowledge collection using word-level and utterance-level semantics. Second, the response candidate interacts with the selected context and knowledge. Finally, it post-selects the relevant knowledge more confidently through fused representations of context and responses.

Result: The model was tested on two benchmark datasets and outperformed existing methods, demonstrating better performance in detecting relevant context and knowledge for response selection.

Conclusion: RSM-DCK effectively enhances response matching by focusing on the most relevant context and knowledge while overcoming the challenges of topic shifts and irrelevant information in multi-turn dialogues.

Abstract: Recently, knowledge-grounded conversations in the open domain gain great
attention from researchers. Existing works on retrieval-based dialogue systems
have paid tremendous efforts to utilize neural networks to build a matching
model, where all of the context and knowledge contents are used to match the
response candidate with various representation methods. Actually, different
parts of the context and knowledge are differentially important for recognizing
the proper response candidate, as many utterances are useless due to the topic
shift. Those excessive useless information in the context and knowledge can
influence the matching process and leads to inferior performance. To address
this problem, we propose a multi-turn \textbf{R}esponse \textbf{S}election
\textbf{M}odel that can \textbf{D}etect the relevant parts of the
\textbf{C}ontext and \textbf{K}nowledge collection (\textbf{RSM-DCK}). Our
model first uses the recent context as a query to pre-select relevant parts of
the context and knowledge collection at the word-level and utterance-level
semantics. Further, the response candidate interacts with the selected context
and knowledge collection respectively. In the end, The fused representation of
the context and response candidate is utilized to post-select the relevant
parts of the knowledge collection more confidently for matching. We test our
proposed model on two benchmark datasets. Evaluation results indicate that our
model achieves better performance than the existing methods, and can
effectively detect the relevant context and knowledge for response selection.

### [159] [Towards Generalizable Implicit In-Context Learning with Attention Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22854)
*Jiaqian Li,Yanshu Li,Ligong Han,Ruixiang Tang,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces In-Context Routing (ICR), a novel method for implicit in-context learning, which improves few-shot performance without labeled demonstrations or task-specific alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing implicit in-context learning (ICL) methods rely on labeled data and task-specific alignment, limiting their generalizability. The authors aim to design a generalizable approach based on ICL’s structural mechanisms.

Method: ICR operates at the attention logits level, using reusable structural patterns and a learnable router to modulate attention logits. This framework allows for train-once-and-reuse adaptability.

Result: ICR was evaluated on 12 diverse datasets across multiple domains and language models (LLMs). It outperformed earlier implicit ICL methods in both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.

Conclusion: ICR proves to be a generalizable and robust alternative to existing implicit ICL approaches, pushing the boundaries of practical value with train-once-and-reuse capability.

Abstract: Implicit in-context learning (ICL) has newly emerged as a promising paradigm
that simulates ICL behaviors in the representation space of Large Language
Models (LLMs), aiming to attain few-shot performance at zero-shot cost.
However, existing approaches largely rely on injecting shift vectors into
residual flows, which are typically constructed from labeled demonstrations or
task-specific alignment. Such designs fall short of utilizing the structural
mechanisms underlying ICL and suffer from limited generalizability. To address
this, we propose In-Context Routing (ICR), a novel implicit ICL method that
internalizes generalizable ICL patterns at the attention logits level. It
extracts reusable structural directions that emerge during ICL and employs a
learnable input-conditioned router to modulate attention logits accordingly,
enabling a train-once-and-reuse framework. We evaluate ICR on 12 real-world
datasets spanning diverse domains and multiple LLMs. The results show that ICR
consistently outperforms prior implicit ICL methods that require task-specific
retrieval or training, while demonstrating robust generalization to
out-of-domain tasks where existing methods struggle. These findings position
ICR to push the boundary of ICL's practical value.

### [160] [The Bias is in the Details: An Assessment of Cognitive Bias in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22856)
*R. Alexander Knipper,Charles S. Knipper,Kaiqi Zhang,Valerie Sims,Clint Bowers,Santu Karmaker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates cognitive biases in 45 large language models (LLMs) through 2.8 million responses, identifying biases in 17.8-57.3% of instances and exploring the impact of model size and prompt specificity on these biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With LLMs increasingly used in decision-making, understanding their susceptibility to cognitive biases—common distortions in human judgment—is vital to ensure their reliability and fairness.

Method: The authors developed a framework based on multiple-choice tasks, curated 220 decision scenarios, and applied scalable prompt generation approaches to assess eight cognitive biases across LLMs.

Result: Bias-consistent behavior was observed in 17.8-57.3% of cases. Better performance correlated with larger model sizes (>32B parameters), which reduced biases in 39.5% of situations, and more detailed prompts mitigated biases by up to 14.9% (except for Overattribution, which worsened by 8.8%).

Conclusion: LLMs are vulnerable to biases, but their susceptibility varies based on model size and prompt specificity. Designing approaches to reduce bias and improve decision-making behavior is critical for ethical LLM deployment.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in real-world
decision-making processes, it becomes crucial to examine the extent to which
they exhibit cognitive biases. Extensively studied in the field of psychology,
cognitive biases appear as systematic distortions commonly observed in human
judgments. This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of eight
well-established cognitive biases across 45 LLMs, analyzing over 2.8 million
LLM responses generated through controlled prompt variations. To achieve this,
we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on multiple-choice tasks,
hand-curate a dataset of 220 decision scenarios targeting fundamental cognitive
biases in collaboration with psychologists, and propose a scalable approach for
generating diverse prompts from human-authored scenario templates. Our analysis
shows that LLMs exhibit bias-consistent behavior in 17.8-57.3% of instances
across a range of judgment and decision-making contexts targeting anchoring,
availability, confirmation, framing, interpretation, overattribution, prospect
theory, and representativeness biases. We find that both model size and prompt
specificity play a significant role on bias susceptibility as follows: larger
size (>32B parameters) can reduce bias in 39.5% of cases, while higher prompt
detail reduces most biases by up to 14.9%, except in one case
(Overattribution), which is exacerbated by up to 8.8%.

### [161] [Lexicon-Enriched Graph Modeling for Arabic Document Readability Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22870)
*Passant Elchafei,Mayar Osama,Mohamed Rageh,Mervat Abuelkheir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid graph-based and transformer-based approach for predicting Arabic document readability, achieving stronger performance than standalone methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the prediction of document-level readability in Arabic by addressing shortcomings in existing methodologies through a novel graph-based representation enriched by lexicons.

Method: The approach models documents as graphs with nodes for sentences and lemmas, leveraging features from the SAMER lexicon and Arabic transformer embeddings. It uses a GNN and transformer as independent branches, combining their outputs with late fusion and aggregating sentence-level predictions via max pooling for document-level results.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows the hybrid method outperforms individual branches in document readability metrics, though the GNN-only approach excels in sentence-level readability predictions.

Conclusion: The fusion approach enhances Arabic document readability predictions, providing a balance between sentence-level precision and document-level performance.

Abstract: We present a graph-based approach enriched with lexicons to predict
document-level readability in Arabic, developed as part of the Constrained
Track of the BAREC Shared Task 2025. Our system models each document as a
sentence-level graph, where nodes represent sentences and lemmas, and edges
capture linguistic relationships such as lexical co-occurrence and class
membership. Sentence nodes are enriched with features from the SAMER lexicon as
well as contextual embeddings from the Arabic transformer model. The graph
neural network (GNN) and transformer sentence encoder are trained as two
independent branches, and their predictions are combined via late fusion at
inference. For document-level prediction, sentence-level outputs are aggregated
using max pooling to reflect the most difficult sentence. Experimental results
show that this hybrid method outperforms standalone GNN or transformer branches
across multiple readability metrics. Overall, the findings highlight that
fusion offers advantages at the document level, but the GNN-only approach
remains stronger for precise prediction of sentence-level readability.

### [162] [HEART: Emotionally-driven test-time scaling of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22876)
*Gabriela Pinto,Palash Goyal,Yiwen Song,Souradip Chakraborty,Zifeng Wang,Tomas Pfister,Hamid Palangi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces HEART, a novel emotionally-driven iterative self-correction framework for language model reasoning. It uses affective feedback based on universal emotions to guide model refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore how emotionally-driven feedback can improve complex reasoning tasks in language models, inspired by psychological research that emotions modulate cognitive performance.

Method: HEART employs emotionally-charged phrases categorized by universal emotions to iteratively refine language model reasoning. Feedback varies across iterations to help escape flawed reasoning paths.

Result: Evaluations on benchmarks like OlympiadBench and Humanity's Last Exam show significant accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art baselines when guided by an oracle verifier.

Conclusion: The research indicates that emotionally-driven feedback has substantial potential for improving machine reasoning, but practical deployment without a verifier remains challenging and requires further exploration.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has shown considerable success in improving the performance
of language models on complex reasoning tasks without requiring fine-tuning.
However, current strategies such as self-reflection primarily focus on logical
or structural refinement. They do not leverage the guiding potential of
affective feedback. Inspired by psychological research showing that emotions
can modulate cognitive performance, we introduce HEART--a novel framework that
uses emotionally-driven prompts for iterative self-correction. HEART provides
feedback on a model's incorrect response using a curated set of concise,
emotionally charged phrases based on the six universal emotions categorized by
Dr. Paul Ekman. By systematically varying the emotional tone of the feedback
across iterations, our method guides the model to escape flawed reasoning paths
and explore more promising alternatives. We evaluate our framework on
challenging reasoning benchmarks including OlympiadBench, Humanity's Last Exam,
and SimpleQA. Our results reveal a significant new phenomenon: when guided by
an oracle verifier, this affective iteration protocol unlocks significantly
deeper reasoning, leading to consistent and substantial increases in accuracy
over state-of-the-art baselines with the same verifier. However, we also
identify a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. In a verifier-free
setting, it struggles to harness these gains consistently, highlighting as a
key challenge for future work. Our findings suggest that the next frontier in
machine reasoning may lie not just in refining logic, but also in understanding
and leveraging the `HEART' of the models.

*EunJeong Hwang,Yuwei Yin,Giuseppe Carenini,Peter West,Vered Shwartz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ToMAgent (ToMA), a dialogue model incorporating Theory of Mind (ToM) to improve goal-oriented interactions and relationships in LLM agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chatbots and LLM-based social agents lack Theory of Mind (ToM), which is essential for understanding others' mental states and improving social intelligence.

Method: The proposed method includes simple prompting of dialogue with ToM integration and the development of ToMAgent (ToMA), which trains dialogue lookahead paired with ToM to enhance interaction goals.

Result: Experiments using Sotopia benchmark highlight ToMA's superior goal-oriented reasoning, long-term adaptability, and ability to maintain positive relationships compared to other baselines.

Conclusion: Integrating Theory of Mind in LLMs offers promising improvements in socially intelligent dialogue systems capable of strategic and adaptive interactions.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM)-an understanding of the mental states of others-is a key
aspect of human social intelligence, yet, chatbots and LLM-based social agents
do not typically integrate it. In this work, we demonstrate that LLMs that
explicitly use ToM get better at dialogue, achieving goals more effectively.
After showing that simply prompting models to generate mental states between
dialogue turns already provides significant benefit, we further introduce
ToMAgent (ToMA), a ToM-focused dialogue agent. ToMA is trained by pairing ToM
with dialogue lookahead to produce mental states that are maximally useful for
achieving dialogue goals. Experiments on the Sotopia interactive social
evaluation benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over a range
of baselines. Comprehensive analysis shows that ToMA exhibits more strategic,
goal-oriented reasoning behaviors, which enable long-horizon adaptation, while
maintaining better relationships with their partners. Our results suggest a
step forward in integrating ToM for building socially intelligent LLM agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Extract-0 is a 7-billion parameter language model optimized for document information extraction, outperforming larger models like GPT-4.1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a task-specific language model for document information extraction with superior performance but lower computational demands.

Method: Extract-0 employs synthetic data generation, supervised fine-tuning using LoRA, and reinforcement learning using GRPO, coupled with a semantic similarity-based reward function.

Result: Extract-0 achieves a mean reward of 0.573 on 1,000 document extraction tasks, surpassing models such as GPT-4.1, o3, and GPT-4.1-2025.

Conclusion: Task-specific optimization allows smaller models like Extract-0 to provide better performance in document extraction compared to general-purpose models with far more parameters.

Abstract: This paper presents Extract-0, a 7-billion parameter language model
specifically optimized for document information extraction that achieves
performance exceeding models with parameter counts several orders of magnitude
larger. Through a novel combination of synthetic data generation, supervised
fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and reinforcement learning via
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Extract-0 achieves a mean reward of
0.573 on a benchmark of 1,000 diverse document extraction tasks, outperforming
GPT-4.1 (0.457), o3 (0.464), and GPT-4.1-2025 (0.459). The training methodology
employs a memory-preserving synthetic data generation pipeline that produces
280,128 training examples from diverse document sources, followed by
parameterefficient fine-tuning that modifies only 0.53% of model weights (40.4M
out of 7.66B parameters). The reinforcement learning phase introduces a novel
semantic similarity-based reward function that handles the inherent ambiguity
in information extraction tasks. This research demonstrates that task-specific
optimization can yield models that surpass general-purpose systems while
requiring substantially fewer computational resource.

*Kelli Henry,Steven Xu,Kaitlin Blotske,Moriah Cargile,Erin F. Barreto,Brian Murray,Susan Smith,Seth R. Bauer,Yanjun Gao,Tianming Liu,Andrea Sikora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates GPT-4o’s performance in medication-related tasks and finds its accuracy lacking, with issues in drug-formulation matching, drug-drug interaction identification, and medication order preparation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to analyze the consistency and reliability of GPT-4o in recommending appropriate medication regimens, as few studies have tested this area.

Method: The study used three benchmarking tests with GPT-4o: matching drug names to formulations, identifying drug-drug interactions (with and without web search), and preparing medication order sentences. Performance was evaluated via cosine similarity, Levenshtein similarity, ROUGE metrics, and manual clinician review.

Result: GPT-4o performed inconsistently across all tasks. Drug-formulation matching had frequent errors, drug-drug interaction identification was only moderately accurate (better with search augmentation but worse for non-interactions), and medication order sentence preparation showed moderate accuracy with errors in 34.2% of responses.

Conclusion: GPT-4o’s poor performance across all tests highlights the need for domain-specific training with clinician-annotated datasets and robust evaluation frameworks for healthcare applications.

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) can be useful in diagnosing medical
conditions, but few studies have evaluated their consistency in recommending
appropriate medication regimens. The purpose of this evaluation was to test
GPT-4o on three medication benchmarking tests including mapping a drug name to
its correct formulation, identifying drug-drug interactions using both its
internal knowledge and using a web search, and preparing a medication order
sentence after being given the medication name. Methods: Using GTP-4o three
experiments were completed. Accuracy was quantified by computing cosine
similarity on TF-IDF vectors, normalized Levenshtein similarity, and
ROUGE-1/ROUGE-L F1 between each response and its reference string or by manual
evaluation by clinicians. Results: GPT-4o performed poorly on drug-formulation
matching, with frequent omissions of available drug formulations (mean 1.23 per
medication) and hallucinations of formulations that do not exist (mean 1.14 per
medication). Only 49% of tested medications were correctly matched to all
available formulations. Accuracy was decreased for medications with more
formulations (p<0.0001). GPT-4o was also inconsistent at identifying
drug-drug-interactions, although it had better performance with the
search-augmented assessment compared to its internal knowledge (54.7% vs.
69.2%, p=0.013). However, allowing a web-search worsened performance when there
was no drug-drug interaction (median % correct 100% vs. 40%, p<0.001). Finally,
GPT-4o performed moderately with preparing a medication order sentence, with
only 65.8% of medication order sentences containing no medication or
abbreviation errors. Conclusions: Model performance was overall poor for all
tests. This highlights the need for domain-specific training through
clinician-annotated datasets and a comprehensive evaluation framework for
benchmarking performance.

### [166] [LLMs Behind the Scenes: Enabling Narrative Scene Illustration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22940)
*Melissa Roemmele,John Joon Young Chung,Taewook Kim,Yuqian Sun,Alex Calderwood,Max Kreminski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a process to generate scene illustrations from story text using large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image models, resulting in the public release of the "SceneIllustrations" dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance storytelling by converting raw textual narratives into illustrative visual content, leveraging generative AI to make stories more engaging and accessible.

Method: The paper employs a pipeline that uses large language models (LLMs) to prompt text-to-image models, transforming story scenes into illustrations. Human annotators then evaluate the quality of these generated illustrations.

Result: The authors create the SceneIllustrations dataset, including illustrations for various story scenes, with quality judgments obtained through human annotation tasks. They also establish that LLMs can effectively extract and verbalize scene knowledge implicit in stories.

Conclusion: The study concludes that using LLMs to guide text-to-image generation is a feasible and impactful approach for narrative scene illustration, enabling advancements in cross-modal storytelling and evaluation.

Abstract: Generative AI has established the opportunity to readily transform content
from one medium to another. This capability is especially powerful for
storytelling, where visual illustrations can illuminate a story originally
expressed in text. In this paper, we focus on the task of narrative scene
illustration, which involves automatically generating an image depicting a
scene in a story. Motivated by recent progress on text-to-image models, we
consider a pipeline that uses LLMs as an interface for prompting text-to-image
models to generate scene illustrations given raw story text. We apply
variations of this pipeline to a prominent story corpus in order to synthesize
illustrations for scenes in these stories. We conduct a human annotation task
to obtain pairwise quality judgments for these illustrations. The outcome of
this process is the SceneIllustrations dataset, which we release as a new
resource for future work on cross-modal narrative transformation. Through our
analysis of this dataset and experiments modeling illustration quality, we
demonstrate that LLMs can effectively verbalize scene knowledge implicitly
evoked by story text. Moreover, this capability is impactful for generating and
evaluating illustrations.

### [167] [What Matters More For In-Context Learning under Matched Compute Budgets: Pretraining on Natural Text or Incorporating Targeted Synthetic Examples?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22947)
*Mohammed Sabry,Anya Belz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies in-context learning (ICL) by testing whether injecting synthetic induction-focused data during pretraining improves ICL compared to training on natural text under constant compute budgets. Results suggest that while synthetic data accelerates induction head activation, it does not consistently improve generalization for ICL tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if targeted pretraining with synthetic data improves in-context learning capabilities by accelerating induction-head development, compared to traditional pretraining using natural text.

Method: The authors introduce Bi-Induct, a curriculum with synthetic data types (forward-copy, backward-copy, or mix) to test pretraining frameworks. They train models with varying size (0.13B to 1B parameters) while analyzing ICL benchmarks, model telemetry, and perplexity.

Result: Synthetic data accelerates induction-head emergence, but it doesn’t guarantee stronger ICL performance. Larger models trained solely on natural text develop broader and more centralized induction capabilities. Synthetic patterns impose negligible perplexity penalties at larger scales.

Conclusion: Targeted synthetic data for induction head activation alone is insufficient to improve ICL. Effective generalization requires that induction circuits become functionally necessary rather than merely present. Diagnostic pretraining approaches should focus on structure utilization and circuit load-bearing systems.

Abstract: Does explicitly exercising the induction circuit during pretraining improve
in-context learning (ICL), or is natural text sufficient when compute is held
constant (iso-FLOPs)? To test whether targeted synthetic data can accelerate
induction-head emergence and enhance ICL, we introduce Bi-Induct, a lightweight
curriculum that injects forward-copy (Induction), backward-copy (Anti), or a
balanced mix into the pretraining stream. We train models from 0.13B to 1B
parameters under iso-FLOPs, evaluating (i) few-shot ICL benchmarks, (ii)
head-level telemetry, and (iii) held-out language modeling perplexity. Our
findings challenge the assumption that early induction circuit activation
directly improves ICL. While Bi-Induct accelerates induction-head emergence at
small scales, this does not consistently yield stronger generalization. On
standard LM benchmarks, Bi-Induct matches natural-only training; on
function-style ICL probes, the 1B natural-only performs best. Stress tests
(e.g., label permutation, HITS@1 vs. HITS@3, 1 vs. 10 shots) preserve these
trends. Telemetry shows larger natural-only models develop broader, earlier
induction heads without explicit induction patterns. Anti-induction data fails
to elicit meaningful activation. Perplexity penalties from synthetic data
shrink with scale, suggesting larger models can absorb non-natural patterns
with minimal cost. Crucially, ablating the top 2% of induction heads degrades
ICL more than random ablations, especially for natural-only models, indicating
more centralized, load-bearing circuits. Bi-Induct variants exhibit more
redundant induction activity, implying different circuit utilization. Overall,
inducing activation is not sufficient: ICL gains depend on these circuits
becoming functionally necessary. These results underscore mechanism-aware
pretraining diagnostics and data mixtures that foster load-bearing, not merely
present, structure.

### [168] [Emergent morpho-phonological representations in self-supervised speech models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22973)
*Jon Gauthier,Canaan Breiss,Matthew Leonard,Edward F. Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the linguistic representations used by self-supervised speech models (S3M) trained for word recognition. It finds their representations link English nouns and verbs to their inflected forms through geometric relationships, not explicitly focusing on phonological or morphological units.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand what types of linguistic representations self-supervised speech models use to efficiently recognize spoken words in noisy conditions and whether they reflect phonological and morphological properties.

Method: The authors study S3M variants trained for word recognition and analyze how these models represent phenomena like noun and verb inflections in English through their internal geometric structure.

Result: The results show that the representations of S3M models form a global linear geometry linking words to their regular inflected forms. However, this structure tracks distributional relationships rather than explicit linguistic units like phonemes or morphemes.

Conclusion: The findings reveal representational strategies that may explain human word recognition and challenge the assumption that phonological and morphological units need distinct representations in linguistic models.

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models can be trained to efficiently recognize spoken
words in naturalistic, noisy environments. However, we do not understand the
types of linguistic representations these models use to accomplish this task.
To address this question, we study how S3M variants optimized for word
recognition represent phonological and morphological phenomena in frequent
English noun and verb inflections. We find that their representations exhibit a
global linear geometry which can be used to link English nouns and verbs to
their regular inflected forms.
  This geometric structure does not directly track phonological or
morphological units. Instead, it tracks the regular distributional
relationships linking many word pairs in the English lexicon -- often, but not
always, due to morphological inflection. These findings point to candidate

### [169] [Same Content, Different Representations: A Controlled Study for Table QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22983)
*Yue Zhang,Seiji Maekawa,Nikita Bhutani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how table representation (structured vs semi-structured) impacts Table Question Answering (Table QA) performance, presenting a diagnostic benchmark and identifying trade-offs between SQL-based methods, LLMs, and hybrid approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of table representation (structured vs semi-structured) on the performance of Table QA models, since previous benchmarks have not systematically addressed this.

Method: The authors develop a verbalization pipeline to generate structured and semi-structured table pairs for controlled comparisons. A diagnostic benchmark evaluates performance based on table size, join requirements, query complexity, and schema quality.

Result: SQL-based methods show high accuracy with structured data but deteriorate with semi-structured data. LLMs are flexible but less precise. Hybrid methods balance performance, especially in noisy schemas, but no single approach excels universally.

Conclusion: Table representation plays a pivotal role in Table QA performance. Hybrid methods are promising for handling diverse real-world data, and the study provides actionable insights for future model designs.

Abstract: Table Question Answering (Table QA) in real-world settings must operate over
both structured databases and semi-structured tables containing textual fields.
However, existing benchmarks are tied to fixed data formats and have not
systematically examined how representation itself affects model performance. We
present the first controlled study that isolates the role of table
representation by holding content constant while varying structure. Using a
verbalization pipeline, we generate paired structured and semi-structured
tables, enabling direct comparisons across modeling paradigms. To support
detailed analysis, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark with splits along table
size, join requirements, query complexity, and schema quality. Our experiments
reveal consistent trade-offs: SQL-based methods achieve high accuracy on
structured inputs but degrade on semi-structured data, LLMs exhibit flexibility
but reduced precision, and hybrid approaches strike a balance, particularly
under noisy schemas. These effects intensify with larger tables and more
complex queries. Ultimately, no single method excels across all conditions, and
we highlight the central role of representation in shaping Table QA
performance. Our findings provide actionable insights for model selection and
design, paving the way for more robust hybrid approaches suited for diverse
real-world data formats.

*Jasin Cekinmez,Omid Ghahroodi,Saad Fowad Chandle,Dhiman Gupta,Ehsaneddin Asgari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes ADAM, a framework consisting of a dataset (AdamDB) and evaluation tools (AdamBench) for testing and improving multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in biographical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of systematic evaluation of biographical reasoning capabilities in LLMs, which is a critical and underexplored area of factual knowledge.

Method: The authors developed AdamDB, a multilingual dataset of over 4 million individuals, and AdamBench, evaluation tools based on Bloom's taxonomy. They also propose AdamRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation system to address hallucinations.

Result: Experiments showed that AdamRAG significantly enhanced open-source models and slightly improved closed-source ones, especially in lower-order reasoning tasks. Multimodal inputs (e.g., face images) yielded smaller and inconsistent benefits.

Conclusion: ADAM serves as a foundational benchmark and framework for biographical reasoning evaluations, supporting the creation of more accurate, multilingual, and hallucination-resistant MLLMs.

Abstract: We introduce ADAM (A Diverse Archive of Mankind), a framework for evaluating
and improving multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in biographical
reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically examine LLM capabilities in biography, a critical yet
underexplored dimension of factual knowledge. At its core, AdamDB is a
multilingual and multimodal dataset covering over 4 million individuals across
geography, time, and profession, while AdamBench provides cognitively
structured evaluations based on Bloom's taxonomy, spanning six reasoning levels
in both English and native languages. To address hallucinations, particularly
for lesser-known individuals, we propose AdamRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation system tailored to biographical contexts. Experiments show that
AdamRAG substantially improves open-source models and modestly benefits
closed-source ones, with the largest gains on lower-order reasoning. Popularity
strongly mediates accuracy, and multimodal input via face images offers
smaller, less consistent improvements than retrieval. ADAM establishes the
first benchmark and framework for cognitively, culturally, and multimodally
grounded biographical evaluation, advancing the development of multilingual,
accurate, and hallucination-resistant MLLMs.

TL;DR: The article introduces English and Czech corpora generated by LLMs to compare linguistic aspects of human vs. AI texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Create a linguistically rich dataset for studying differences between LLM and human-generated texts.

Method: Generated multi-genre corpora using LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Alphabet, Meta, and DeepSeek, employing Universal Dependencies tagging.

Result: Produced corpora with significant token counts (27M English tokens, 21.5M Czech tokens) across multiple LLMs.

Conclusion: Freely available corpora contribute to linguistic research and are accessible via Czech National Corpus interface.

Abstract: This article presents two corpora of English and Czech texts generated with
large language models (LLMs). The motivation is to create a resource for
comparing human-written texts with LLM-generated text linguistically. Emphasis
was placed on ensuring these resources are multi-genre and rich in terms of
topics, authors, and text types, while maintaining comparability with existing
human-created corpora. These generated corpora replicate reference human
corpora: BE21 by Paul Baker, which is a modern version of the original Brown
Corpus, and Koditex corpus that also follows the Brown Corpus tradition but in
Czech. The new corpora were generated using models from OpenAI, Anthropic,
Alphabet, Meta, and DeepSeek, ranging from GPT-3 (davinci-002) to GPT-4.5, and
are tagged according to the Universal Dependencies standard (i.e., they are
tokenized, lemmatized, and morphologically and syntactically annotated). The
subcorpus size varies according to the model used (the English part contains on
average 864k tokens per model, 27M tokens altogether, the Czech partcontains on
average 768k tokens per model, 21.5M tokens altogether). The corpora are freely
available for download under the CC BY 4.0 license (the annotated data are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReMemR1 proposes a memory-augmented system and a novel reinforcement learning technique to address problems in long-context question-answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for handling long-context question answering with large language models face issues like forward-only processing, information loss, and sparse reinforcement learning signals.

Method: The paper introduces ReMemR1 with callback-enhanced memory for selective retrieval and non-linear reasoning. It also proposes RLMLR (Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Level Rewards) to provide dense step-level signals alongside final-answer rewards.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that ReMemR1 outperforms existing memory-based methods in long-document question answering, showcasing its efficiency in addressing the outlined challenges.

Conclusion: The combined system of ReMemR1 and RLMLR offers a promising solution for enhancing long-context reasoning in large language models, mitigating memory degradation and improving supervision and reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models face challenges in long-context question answering,
where key evidence of a query may be dispersed across millions of tokens.
Existing works equip large language models with a memory corpus that is
dynamically updated during a single-pass document scan, also known as the
"memorize while reading" methods. While this approach scales efficiently, it
suffers from irreversible forward-only processing, information loss through
overwriting, and sparse reinforcement learning signals. To tackle these
challenges, we present ReMemR1, a memory-augmented agent with callback-enhanced
memory that allows selective retrieval from the entire memory history and
allows non-linear reasoning and revisiting of early evidence. To further
strengthen training, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Level Rewards
(RLMLR), which combines final-answer rewards with dense, step-level signals
that guide effective memory use. Together, these contributions mitigate
information degradation, improve supervision, and support multi-hop memory
utilizing. Experiments on long-document QA show significant gains over existing
memory-based approaches, which validates ReMemR1 as an effective solution for
long-context reasoning agents.

### [173] [Peacemaker or Troublemaker: How Sycophancy Shapes Multi-Agent Debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23055)
*Binwei Yao,Chao Shang,Wanyu Du,Jianfeng He,Ruixue Lian,Yi Zhang,Hang Su,Sandesh Swamy,Yanjun Qi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses how sycophancy in Large Language Models (LLMs) affects the quality of multi-agent debating systems (MADS), proposing definitions, metrics, and methods to study and mitigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the challenge of excessive agreeability in LLMs, which undermines the value of debates in MADS by fostering premature consensus and reducing argument quality.

Method: The researchers define sycophancy for MADS, develop metrics to quantify it, and study its effects on decentralized and centralized debate setups. They analyze varying levels of sycophancy in debate roles (debaters and judges).

Result: The findings show that sycophancy leads to debate collapse before reaching correct conclusions, reduces accuracy compared to single-agent systems, and stems from distinct failure modes in debaters and judges.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with actionable design principles for MADS to balance disagreement and cooperation, aiming to mitigate sycophancy and improve debate outcomes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often display sycophancy, a tendency toward
excessive agreeability. This behavior poses significant challenges for
multi-agent debating systems (MADS) that rely on productive disagreement to
refine arguments and foster innovative thinking. LLMs' inherent sycophancy can
collapse debates into premature consensus, potentially undermining the benefits
of multi-agent debate. While prior studies focus on user--LLM sycophancy, the
impact of inter-agent sycophancy in debate remains poorly understood. To
address this gap, we introduce the first operational framework that (1)
proposes a formal definition of sycophancy specific to MADS settings, (2)
develops new metrics to evaluate the agent sycophancy level and its impact on
information exchange in MADS, and (3) systematically investigates how varying
levels of sycophancy across agent roles (debaters and judges) affects outcomes
in both decentralized and centralized debate frameworks. Our findings reveal
that sycophancy is a core failure mode that amplifies disagreement collapse
before reaching a correct conclusion in multi-agent debates, yields lower
accuracy than single-agent baselines, and arises from distinct debater-driven
and judge-driven failure modes. Building on these findings, we propose
actionable design principles for MADS, effectively balancing productive
disagreement with cooperation in agent interactions.

### [174] [Semantic Voting: A Self-Evaluation-Free Approach for Efficient LLM Self-Improvement on Unverifiable Open-ended Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23067)
*Chunyang Jiang,Yonggang Zhang,Yiyang Cai,Chi-Min Chan,Yulong Liu,Mingming Chen,Wei Xue,Yike Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 'semantic voting' method for self-improvement in large language models, offering a computationally efficient, self-evaluation-free approach that leverages semantic similarity for unverifiable tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs and overconfidence biases in self-evaluation methods for large language models, especially in unverifiable tasks, prompted a search for alternative strategies.

Method: The authors replace hard matching with semantic voting (soft matching), utilizing lightweight sentence embedding models to assess semantic similarities in model-generated responses.

Result: The proposed semantic voting achieved better computational efficiency and improved performance compared to existing self-evaluation methods across varying architectures and tasks.

Conclusion: Semantic voting proves to be a promising, efficient alternative to self-evaluation for self-improvement of large language models, especially in handling unverifiable tasks.

Abstract: The rising cost of acquiring supervised data has driven significant interest
in self-improvement for large language models (LLMs). Straightforward
unsupervised signals like majority voting have proven effective in generating
pseudo-labels for verifiable tasks, while their applicability to unverifiable
tasks (e.g., translation) is limited by the open-ended character of responses.
As a result, self-evaluation mechanisms (e.g., self-judging and entropy
minimization) are predominantly used to derive pseudo-labels. However,
self-evaluation relying on LLMs typically incurs high computational overhead
and introduces overconfidence issues due to intrinsic biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel self-evaluation-free approach for unverifiable
tasks, designed for lightweight yet effective self-improvement. Inspired by
majority voting commonly employed in verifiable tasks, we propose semantic
voting as a novel mechanism that relaxes the principle of hard matching (i.e.,
exact matching) toward soft matching (i.e., semantic similarity). Soft matching
is achieved by leveraging a lightweight sentence embedding model to quantify
semantic similarity, thereby mitigating excessive computational burden and
intrinsic bias-associated limitations of self-evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial gains in
computational efficiency and overall better performance than self-evaluation
methods across diverse model architectures and tasks.

TL;DR: EviPath introduces a novel approach to train retrieval-augmented generation agents by synthesizing evidence-anchored reasoning paths, showing significant improvement in question-answering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of effective supervision methods hampers the development of retrieval-augmented generation agents in handling complex reasoning and environmental interaction tasks.

Method: EviPath includes three core components: Abductive Subtask Planning to decompose and iteratively optimize solution paths, Faithful Sub-question Answering with evidence-based reasoning, and Conversational Fine-Tuning to format agent interactions into dialogue for training.

Result: Extensive testing demonstrates that an 8B parameter model trained with EviPath-synthesized data achieves a substantial 14.7% EM gain in open-domain question answering compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: EviPath effectively enables LLMs to develop advanced reasoning and tool-use capabilities through synthesized supervision, significantly advancing RAG agent performance.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation agents development is hindered by the lack of
process-level supervision to effectively guide agentic capabilities like task
decomposition, retriever invocation, and stepwise decision-making. While
reinforcement learning offers a potential solution, it suffers from sparse
rewards and the limited reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
Meanwhile, existing data synthesis methods only produce chain-of-thought
rationales and fail to model environmental interactions. In this paper, we
propose EviPath, an evidence-anchored reasoning path synthesis paradigm for RAG
agent development. EviPath comprises: (i) Abductive Subtask Planning, which
decomposes the problem into sub-questions and iteratively plans an optimal
solution path based on the dependencies between them; (ii) Faithful
Sub-question Answering, which uses supporting evidence to construct a proxy
environment to generate reasoning thoughts and answers for each sub-question;
and (iii) Conversational Fine-Tuning, which formats the complete
agent-environment interaction trajectory into a dialogue format suitable for
Supervised Fine-Tuning. EviPath allows LLMs to learn complex reasoning and
tool-use capabilities directly from synthesized data. Extensive experiments on
widely-used question-answering benchmarks show that an 8B parameter model
trained with EviPath-synthesized data significantly and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a double-digit absolute EM gain of
14.7% in open-domain question answering.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework using credal sets to study uncertainty in text generation tasks, revealing challenges in aligning models with human creative variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of quantifying and understanding uncertainties in AI-generated content, especially in creative tasks.

Method: The study uses credal sets to measure uncertainty in text generation. It evaluates outputs from four language models, across five decoding strategies, against human-generated text variations.

Result: The best model achieved a calibration score of 0.434, highlighting significant gaps in capturing human creative diversity. Decoding strategies contributed notably to epistemic uncertainty.

Conclusion: A geometric framework with credal sets offers insights for enhancing model calibration and creative alignment between human and AI outputs.

Abstract: Understanding uncertainty in large language models remains a fundamental
challenge, particularly in creative tasks where multiple valid outputs exist.
We present a geometric framework using credal sets - convex hulls of
probability distributions - to quantify and decompose uncertainty in neural
text generation, calibrated against human creative variation. Analyzing 500
creative writing prompts from the WritingPrompts dataset with 10 unique human
continuations each, we evaluate four language models across five decoding
strategies, generating 100,000 stories. Our credal set analysis reveals
substantial gaps in capturing human creative variation, with the best
model-human calibration reaching only 0.434 (Gemma-2B with temperature 0.7). We
decompose total uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, finding
that the choice of decoding strategy contributes 39.4% to 72.0% of total
epistemic uncertainty. Model scale shows weak correlation with calibration
quality and no significant difference exists between base and instruction-tuned
models in calibration quality. Our geometric framework provides actionable
insights for improving generation systems for human-AI creative alignment. We
release our complete experimental framework.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free KV cache framework, d$^2$Cache, to improve the inference speed and quality of diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in inference caused by the lack of compatibility with standard KV caches in dLLMs, which impacts their practicality compared to autoregressive models.

Method: Proposes d$^2$Cache, which uses a two-stage fine-grained selection strategy to adaptively update KV states for select tokens while caching the rest for reuse during decoding, offering efficient and reliable decoding.

Result: Extensive experiments on dLLMs (LLaDA and Dream) demonstrate significant inference speedups and improved generation quality when using d$^2$Cache.

Conclusion: d$^2$Cache enables faster and higher-quality inference with dLLMs without requiring additional training, making dLLMs more efficient and practical.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), despite their promising
performance, still suffer from inferior inference efficiency. This is because
dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention and cannot directly benefit from the
standard key-value (KV) cache as autoregressive models (ARMs) do. To tackle
this issue, we introduce \textit{Dual aDaptive Cache} (d$^2$Cache), which is a
training-free approximate KV cache framework for accelerating dLLM inference.
d$^2$Cache features a two-stage fine-grained selection strategy to identify
tokens and adaptively update their KV states at each decoding step, while
caching the KV states of the remaining tokens for reuse. Furthermore,
d$^2$Cache naturally offers a more reliable decoding alternative, which can
enable quasi left-to-right generation and mitigate premature overconfidence in
tokens at the end of the sequence. Extensive experimental results on two
representative dLLMs (\ie, LLaDA and Dream) demonstrate that d$^2$Cache not
only achieves substantial inference speedups, but also yields consistent
improvements in generation quality. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of generating valid molecules using large language models (LLMs), particularly focusing on SMILES and SELFIES representations, and proposes SmiSelf to achieve 100% validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finding novel compound structures with specific properties is crucial in drug discovery and materials science. Effective molecule generation with LLMs could accelerate such advancements.

Method: The study evaluates LLMs on their ability to generate molecules using SELFIES and SMILES representations and introduces SmiSelf, a framework converting invalid SMILES to SELFIES following grammatical rules for correction.

Result: Experiments demonstrate SmiSelf ensures 100% validity in molecule generation while preserving molecular features and improving performance on several metrics.

Conclusion: SmiSelf enhances the practical application of LLMs in molecule generation, especially in biomedicine, by ensuring validity and compatibility with SMILES-based generative models.

Abstract: Molecule generation is key to drug discovery and materials science, enabling
the design of novel compounds with specific properties. Large language models
(LLMs) can learn to perform a wide range of tasks from just a few examples.
However, generating valid molecules using representations like SMILES is
challenging for LLMs in few-shot settings. In this work, we explore how LLMs
can generate 100% valid molecules. We evaluate whether LLMs can use SELFIES, a
representation where every string corresponds to a valid molecule, for valid
molecule generation but find that LLMs perform worse with SELFIES than with
SMILES. We then examine LLMs' ability to correct invalid SMILES and find their
capacity limited. Finally, we introduce SmiSelf, a cross-chemical language
framework for invalid SMILES correction. SmiSelf converts invalid SMILES to
SELFIES using grammatical rules, leveraging SELFIES' mechanisms to correct the
invalid SMILES. Experiments show that SmiSelf ensures 100% validity while
preserving molecular characteristics and maintaining or even enhancing
performance on other metrics. SmiSelf helps expand LLMs' practical applications
in biomedicine and is compatible with all SMILES-based generative models. Code

Simulation TL;DR: A non-collaborative user simulation method for tool agent.
Abstract: Tool agents interact with users through multi-turn dialogues to
accomplish various tasks. Recent studies have adopted user simulation methods
to develop these agents in multi-turn settings. However, existing user
simulators tend to be agent-friendly, exhibiting only cooperative behaviors,
which fails to train and test agents against non-collaborative users in the
real world. To address this, we propose a novel user simulator architecture
that simulates four categories of non-collaborative behaviors: requesting
unavailable services, digressing into tangential conversations, expressing
impatience, and providing incomplete utterances. Our user simulator can
simulate challenging and natural non-collaborative behaviors while reliably
delivering all intents and information necessary to accomplish the task. Our
experiments on MultiWOZ and $\tau$-bench reveal significant performance
degradation in state-of-the-art tool agents when encountering non-collaborative
users. We provide detailed analyses of agents' weaknesses under each
non-collaborative condition, such as escalated hallucinations and dialogue
breakdowns. Ultimately, we contribute an easily extensible user simulation
framework to help the research community develop tool agents and preemptively
diagnose them under challenging real-world conditions within their own
services.

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) can effectively translate mathematical and computer science problems from Romanian to English, maintaining or enhancing their performance with structured prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of LLMs underperforming in mathematical and computer science tasks when translating from Romanian to English, impacting applications like educational materials and translations in competitions.

Method: Evaluated translation performance of multiple LLMs (OpenRoLLM, Llama 3.1 8B, Llama 3.2 3B, GPT-4o) using structured prompts, repeated accuracy testing, and comparison with human translators. Additionally, enhanced the OJI dataset with precise translations.

Result: Found that robust LLMs can achieve reliable translation accuracy and maintain performance with structured prompts. Augmented a Romanian dataset with accurate translations for improved LLM training.

Conclusion: LLMs, with proper oversight and structured prompts, are a viable tool for multilingual problem-solving and translation tasks, performing comparably to human translators in some cases.

Abstract: Recent studies have suggested that large language models (LLMs) underperform
on mathematical and computer science tasks when these problems are translated
from Romanian into English, compared to their original Romanian format.
Accurate translation is critical for applications ranging from automatic
translations in programming competitions to the creation of high-quality
educational materials, as well as minimizing errors or fraud in human
translations. This study shows that robust large language models (LLMs) can
maintain or even enhance their performance in translating less common languages
when given well-structured prompts. Our findings suggest that LLMs, with
appropriate supervision, can be reliably used for the automatic translation of
IOI (International Olympiad in Informatics)-style tasks. We evaluate several
translation methods across multiple LLMs, including OpenRoLLM, Llama 3.1 8B,
Llama 3.2 3B and GPT-4o, assessing their translation accuracy and performance
stability through repeated runs. Additionally, we augment the OJI (Romanian
County-Level Informatics Olympiad) Romanian dataset with accurate English
translations, enhancing its utility for future LLM training and evaluation.
Through detailed syntactic and semantic analyses, we confirm that with human
oversight, LLMs can serve as a viable solution for multilingual
problem-solving. We also compare the translation quality of LLMs against human
translators, as evaluated by a certified expert, underscoring the potential of
LLMs in realworld scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TagPR, a training framework that improves the personalization reasoning of Large Language Models by tagging reasoning chains and using a combined supervised and reinforcement learning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models struggle to personalize responses based on user data and preferences.

Method: The method involves tagging reasoning chains to create a structured dataset, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning guided by specialized reward models to align logic with user-specific needs.

Result: TagPR achieves a 32.65% performance improvement over base models on personalization benchmarks.

Conclusion: Structured reasoning significantly enhances personalization in LLMs, as validated by improved performance metrics.

Abstract: Recent advancements have endowed Large Language Models (LLMs) with impressive
general reasoning capabilities, yet they often struggle with personalization
reasoning - the crucial ability to analyze user history, infer unique
preferences, and generate tailored responses. To address this limitation, we
introduce TagPR, a novel training framework that significantly enhances an
LLM's intrinsic capacity for personalization reasoning through a tagging the
thought approach. Our method first develops a data-driven pipeline to
automatically generate and semantically label reasoning chains, creating a
structured dataset that fosters interpretable reasoning. We then propose a
synergistic training strategy that begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on
this tagged data to establish foundational reasoning patterns, followed by a
multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL) process. This RL phase is guided by a
unique composite reward signal, which integrates tag-based constraints and a
novel Personalization Reward Model with User Embeddings (PRMU) to achieve
fine-grained alignment with user-specific logic. Extensive experiments on the
public LaMP benchmark and a self-constructed dataset demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results, delivering an average improvement
of 32.65% over the base model across all tasks. Our work validates that
structured, interpretable reasoning is a highly effective pathway to unlocking
genuine personalization capabilities in LLMs.

*Zichao Yu,Ming Li,Wenyi Zhang,Weiguo Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes TReASURe, a tree search method tailored for aligning Masked Diffusion Language Models with task-specific rewards, overcoming challenges like correlated branches and unstable pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree search shows potential for task-specific alignment in generative models but faces difficulties with Masked Diffusion Language Models due to branch correlations and reward estimation variances.

Method: The approach employs UnmaskBranch to diversify branches and ResubstituteScore for stable, low-variance pruning, supported by a theoretical framework quantifying efficiency gains and error bounds.

Result: TReASURe achieves state-of-the-art performance in perplexity, linguistic acceptability, and sentiment/toxicity control, surpassing previous methods, especially in low-compute settings.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses key challenges in tree search for Masked Diffusion Language Models, providing efficient and superior results under constrained resources.

Abstract: Tree search has recently emerged as a powerful framework for aligning
generative models with task-specific rewards at test time. Applying tree search
to Masked Diffusion Language Models, however, introduces two key challenges:
(i) parallel unmasking yields highly correlated branches, limiting exploration,
and (ii) reward evaluation via sampled completions produces high-variance
estimates, making pruning unstable. We propose TReASURe, a tree-search
test-time alignment method that addresses these issues. It introduces (i)
UnmaskBranch, a branching strategy based on first-hitting unmasking that
diversifies both token content and reveal order with a single model call per
parent node, and (ii) ResubstituteScore, a pruning rule that uses deterministic
resubstitution to score partially masked sequences with low-variance proxy
completions. Theoretically, we quantify branching efficiency gains in NFEs
(number of function evaluations), show that the scoring rule approximates the
true reward with error bounded by predictive uncertainty, and prove
improvements with larger tree widths. Empirically, TReASURe achieves
state-of-the-art results on perplexity, linguistic acceptability, and control
of sentiment and toxicity, outperforming prior methods under matched compute
budgets, with especially strong gains in low-NFE regimes.

### [183] [Test-Time Policy Adaptation for Enhanced Multi-Turn Interactions with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23166)
*Chenxing Wei,Hong Wang,Ying He,Fei Yu,Yao Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ROSA, an algorithm enabling real-time self-correction in LLMs during multi-turn interactions to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models often underperform during extended interactions because they lack adaptation mechanisms to real-time feedback.

Method: The paper proposes a Test-Time Policy Adaptation framework and a one-step algorithm (ROSA) that adjusts model parameters using user feedback without heavy computational demands.

Result: ROSA enhances conversational efficiency and task effectiveness, backed by theoretical convergence guarantees and validated by experimental benchmarks.

Conclusion: Integrating ROSA allows LLMs to effectively self-correct during ongoing interactions, aligning closer to user preferences.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) employ multi-turn interaction as a fundamental
paradigm for completing complex tasks. However, their performance often
degrades in extended interactions, as they are typically trained on static,
single-turn data, which hinders their ability to adapt to real-time user
feedback. To address this limitation, we first propose a new paradigm:
Test-Time Policy Adaptation for Multi-Turn Interactions (T2PAM), which utilizes
user feedback from the ongoing interaction as a reward signal to estimate a
latent optimal policy aligned with user preferences, then updates a small
subset of parameters to steer the model toward this policy, ultimately enabling
efficient in-conversation self-correction. We then introduce Optimum-Referenced
One-Step Adaptation (ROSA), a lightweight algorithm that operationalizes T2PAM.
ROSA guides the model parameters toward a theoretical optimal policy in a
single, efficient update step, avoiding costly iterative gradient-based
optimization and minimizing computational overhead. We provide a rigorous
theoretical analysis guaranteeing that the policy of ROSA converges to the
preference of user as the number of interactions increases. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmark demonstrate that ROSA achieves significant
improvements in both task effectiveness and efficiency.

### [184] [Pretraining LLM with Latent Thoughts in Continuous Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23184)
*Boyi Zeng,He Li,Shixiang Song,Yixuan Wang,Ziwei He,Xinbing Wang,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pretraining methodology for language models (LMs) that uses latent thoughts to improve token generation, outperforming larger models at identical inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore whether the success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, which scales generation steps at test time, could similarly enhance language model capabilities during pretraining.

Method: The proposed method involves pretraining LMs to generate intermediate latent thoughts (hidden states at current positions) for refining token prediction, allowing for computation in continuous latent spaces before final token output.

Result: The approach enables a 1.4B parameter language model to outperform a standard 2.8B parameter model in language modeling tasks and various downstream applications while maintaining similar inference costs.

Conclusion: Including latent thoughts during pretraining provides a more computation-efficient way to enhance model performance and can be extended to form chains of latent thoughts analogous to Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

Abstract: The remarkable success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which enhances performance
by scaling generation steps at test-time, inspires us to ask: can we leverage a
similar scaling of computational steps during pretraining to improve the
generation of each individual token? To address this, we propose a novel
pre-training methodology: Pretraining Language Models with Latent Thoughts. Our
approach pretrains a language model (LM) to first generate an intermediate
latent thought-the last hidden state of the current position-which is then used
as input to predict the actual subsequent token. This additional computational
step enables the LM to refine its prediction within unconstrained continuous
space. Our experiments demonstrate that, at an identical inference cost, a LM
that generates one additional latent thought per token outperforms a standard
model with double the parameters. For instance, ours-1.4B (Pythia Arch),
pretrained on 300B tokens from the Pile, significantly surpasses the vanilla
Pythia-2.8B trained on the same data on both language modeling and a range of
general downstream tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of latent thoughts
generated before each actual token-forming a chain analogous to
CoT-consistently improves the model's performance.

*Guancheng Wan,Leixin Sun,Longxu Dou,Zitong Shi,Fang Wu,Eric Hanchen Jiang,Wenke Huang,Guibin Zhang,Hejia Geng,Xiangru Tang,Zhenfei Yin,Yizhou Sun,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses issues in large language model-based multi-agent systems by introducing a framework to diagnose, localize, and align hierarchical compliance under instruction conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solve systemic problems in LLM multi-agent systems where instruction conflicts lead to micro-level compliance issues, impacting reliability.

Method: A three-stage framework: Diagnose (using CRAS metric), Localize (attention drift analysis), and Align (SAIL for layer-specific optimization).

Result: The surgical approach significantly enhances compliance with instruction hierarchies without requiring full-model fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a scalable solution to address instruction conflicts in LLM-powered multi-agent systems, improving reliability-critical deployments.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have rapidly
advanced collaborative reasoning, tool use, and role-specialized coordination
in complex tasks. However, reliability-critical deployment remains hindered by
a systemic failure mode: hierarchical compliance under instruction conflicts
(system-user, peer-peer), where agents misprioritize system-level rules in the
presence of competing demands. Moreover, widely used macro-level metrics (e.g.,
pass@k) obscure these micro-level violations and offer little actionable
guidance for remedy. In this work, we present a full-stack, three-stage
framework: (1) Diagnose - Contextualized Role Adherence Score (CRAS), a
query-wise, context-aware scoring metric that decomposes role adherence into
four measurable dimensions; (2) Localize - attention drift analysis revealing
that instruction conflicts are resolved by attention heads that are largely
concentrated in middle layers; (3) Align - Surgical Alignment of Instruction
Layers (SAIL), which installs LoRA only on the localized focal layers and
optimizes a token-weighted DPO-style preference objective that credits tokens
by their focal attentional contribution. Across standard benchmarks and MAS
frameworks, our surgical approach improves instruction hierarchy compliance
(e.g., +5.60% with AutoGen on MedQA) without full-model finetuning.

*Haonan Wang,Weida Liang,Zihang Fu,Nie Zheng,Yifan Zhang,Yao Tong,Tongyao Zhu,Hao Jiang,Chuang Li,Jiaying Wu,Kenji Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines why recent reasoning LLMs struggle with few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and introduces a novel method (I2S) to improve their reasoning capabilities, showing notable performance improvements across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates why reasoning LLMs trained with verifier-based reinforcement learning might perform worse with few-shot CoT reasoning compared to direct answering.

Method: The paper introduces Insight-to-Solve (I2S), a sequential test-time procedure that generates reusable insights from demonstrations and derives question-specific reasoning traces. It also optionally includes self-refinement (I2S+) for coherence and correctness.

Result: I2S and I2S+ consistently outperform baselines, achieving significant accuracy improvements in benchmarks such as AIME and GPQA. Notable gains were observed with models, including GPT-4.1 (+14.0% on AIME’25).

Conclusion: The insight-refine-solve framework, when combined with effective in-context demonstrations, significantly improves reasoning performance of LLMs, addressing the paradox of few-shot CoT underperformance.

Abstract: Recent reasoning LLMs (RLMs), especially those trained with verifier-based
reinforcement learning, often perform worse with few-shot CoT than with direct
answering. We revisit this paradox using high-quality reasoning traces from
DeepSeek-R1 as demonstrations and find that adding more exemplars consistently
degrades accuracy, even when demonstrations are optimal. A detailed analysis
reveals two mechanisms behind this decline: (i) semantic misguidance, where
high textual similarity leads the model to treat the target as the same as the
exemplar and to copy intermediate steps verbatim; and (ii) strategy transfer
failure, where the model struggles to extract useful reasoning strategies and
apply them to target questions. Guided by these, we introduce Insight-to-Solve
(I2S), a sequential test-time procedure that turns demonstrations into
explicit, reusable insights and derives a target-specific reasoning trace;
optionally, the reasoning is self-refined for coherence and correctness (I2S+).
Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show that I2S and I2S+ consistently
outperform both direct answering and test-time scaling baselines across open-
and closed-source models. Even for GPT models, our method helps: on AIME'25,
GPT-4.1 rises by +14.0%, and o1-mini improves by +2.7% on AIME and +1.7% on
GPQA, indicating that in-context demonstrations can be harnessed effectively
via insight-refine-solve framework.

*Aditya Narayan Sankaran,Reza Farahbakhsh,Noel Crespi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines code-switching and English usage in globally successful K-pop songs, identifying linguistic patterns influenced by market pressures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how linguistic strategies like code-switching and English usage contribute to the global success of K-pop songs, especially in different chart contexts.

Method: A dataset of K-pop songs from Billboard Hot 100 and Global 200 charts was analyzed for proportions of Korean and English lyrics, code-switching frequency, stylistic features, and classification tasks using machine learning methods.

Result: English dominates in globally successful K-pop songs with high code-switching; machine learning classified performer gender from lyrics with macro F1 scores up to 0.76.

Conclusion: Linguistic choices in K-pop reflect market pressures and performer identity; higher English usage plays a critical role in US-focused chart success.

Abstract: Code switching, particularly between Korean and English, has become a
defining feature of modern K-pop, reflecting both aesthetic choices and global
market strategies. This paper is a primary investigation into the linguistic
strategies employed in K-pop songs that achieve global chart success, with a
focus on the role of code-switching and English lyric usage. A dataset of K-pop
songs that appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 and Global 200 charts from 2017 to
2025, spanning 14 groups and 8 solo artists, was compiled. Using this dataset,
the proportion of English and Korean lyrics, the frequency of code-switching,
and other stylistic features were analysed. It was found that English dominates
the linguistic landscape of globally charting K-pop songs, with both male and
female performers exhibiting high degrees of code-switching and English usage.
Statistical tests indicated no significant gender-based differences, although
female solo artists tend to favour English more consistently. A classification
task was also performed to predict performer gender from lyrics, achieving
macro F1 scores up to 0.76 using multilingual embeddings and handcrafted
features. Finally, differences between songs charting on the Hot 100 versus the
Global 200 were examined, suggesting that, while there is no significant gender
difference in English, higher English usage may be more critical for success in
the US-focused Hot 100. The findings highlight how linguistic choices in K-pop
lyrics are shaped by global market pressures and reveal stylistic patterns that
reflect performer identity and chart context.

### [188] [Steering Prepositional Phrases in Language Models: A Case of with-headed Adjectival and Adverbial Complements in Gemma-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23204)
*Stefan Arnold,René Gröbner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how the language model Gemma-2 decides whether prepositional phrases function adverbially or adjectivally. It identifies mechanisms and interventions to control this aspect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand and manipulate the internal mechanisms within language models, like Gemma-2, that decide whether prepositional phrases function as instrumental adjuncts or attributive modifiers.

Method: The authors use a prompt suite with ambiguous prepositional phrases and analyze attention head activations in vocabulary space. They manipulate the scaling of value vectors in attention heads to control complement functionality.

Result: Gemma-2 shows a default preference for instrumental interpretations at a 3:4 ratio. By altering the value vector of a single attention head, the authors can shift this balance, reducing instrumental interpretations to 33% and increasing attributive ones to 36%.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the internal mechanisms driving functional role resolution in language models and demonstrates that targeted interventions can effectively alter these decisions.

Abstract: Language Models, when generating prepositional phrases, must often decide for
whether their complements functions as an instrumental adjunct (describing the
verb adverbially) or an attributive modifier (enriching the noun adjectivally),
yet the internal mechanisms that resolve this split decision remain poorly
understood. In this study, we conduct a targeted investigation into Gemma-2 to
uncover and control the generation of prepositional complements. We assemble a
prompt suite containing with-headed prepositional phrases whose contexts
equally accommodate either an instrumental or attributive continuation,
revealing a strong preference for an instrumental reading at a ratio of 3:4. To
pinpoint individual attention heads that favor instrumental over attributive
complements, we project activations into the vocabulary space. By scaling the
value vector of a single attention head, we can shift the distribution of
functional roles of complements, attenuating instruments to 33% while elevating
attributes to 36%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces PARL-MT, a framework that incorporates progress awareness into training large language models (LLMs) for multi-turn function calling tasks, improving long-term task execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges existing in current approaches to multi-turn function calling in LLMs, such as neglecting task-level planning and redundancy issues in reinforcement learning, in order to ensure coherent execution of long-horizon tasks.

Method: The method includes the development of the PARL-MT framework, which has two key components: the Progress Awareness Generation (PAG) pipeline to construct datasets coupling conversation summaries with task planning, and the Progress Awareness-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PAG-RL) algorithm to integrate progress awareness into RL training.

Result: Empirical evaluations on two public benchmarks show that PARL-MT outperforms existing methods, demonstrating improved efficiency and robustness in multi-turn function calling tasks.

Conclusion: The study concludes that explicitly incorporating progress awareness into the LLM training process significantly enhances the capability of LLMs in multi-turn conversations and function execution, making them more effective for real-world applications like multi-stage tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success in single-turn
function calling, yet real-world applications such as travel planning or
multi-stage data analysis typically unfold across multi-turn conversations. In
these settings, LLMs must not only issue accurate function calls at each step
but also maintain progress awareness, the ability to summarize past
interactions and plan future actions to ensure coherent, long-horizon task
execution. Existing approaches, however, either reduce multi-turn training to
isolated single-turn samples, which neglects task-level planning, or employ
end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) that struggles with redundancy and lacks
explicit integration of progress awareness. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce PARL-MT, a framework that explicitly incorporates progress awareness
into LLM training for multi-turn function calling. PARL-MT combines (i) a
Progress Awareness Generation (PAG) pipeline, which automatically constructs
datasets coupling conversation summaries with future task planning, and (ii) a
Progress Awareness-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PAG-RL) algorithm, which
integrates progress awareness into RL training to reduce contextual redundancy
and improve alignment between local actions and global task completion.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks demonstrate that PARL-MT
significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of
progress awareness in enabling robust and efficient multi-turn function
calling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the generation capabilities of current Visual Language Models in the art domain by focusing on their ability to critique Chinese paintings.

Method: A quantitative framework with multi-dimensional evaluative features was created, followed by persona-guided prompts to test models' critique generation capabilities.

Result: The study identified the strengths and weaknesses of Visual Language Models, highlighting their performance in complex semantic tasks like art critique generation.

Conclusion: The research provides insights into the potential and limitations of Visual Language Models in the nuanced domain of art critique and identifies areas for future improvement.

Abstract: This study aims to test and evaluate the capabilities and characteristics of
current mainstream Visual Language Models (VLMs) in generating critiques for
traditional Chinese painting. To achieve this, we first developed a
quantitative framework for Chinese painting critique. This framework was
constructed by extracting multi-dimensional evaluative features covering
evaluative stance, feature focus, and commentary quality from human expert
critiques using a zero-shot classification model. Based on these features,
several representative critic personas were defined and quantified. This
framework was then employed to evaluate selected VLMs such as Llama, Qwen, or
Gemini. The experimental design involved persona-guided prompting to assess the
VLM's ability to generate critiques from diverse perspectives. Our findings
reveal the current performance levels, strengths, and areas for improvement of
VLMs in the domain of art critique, offering insights into their potential and
limitations in complex semantic understanding and content generation tasks. The

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLAIRE, a system combining large language model (LLM) reasoning and retrieval, to detect factual inconsistencies in Wikipedia. CLAIRE significantly improved editors' ability to identify inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wikipedia serves as a critical resource for training LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation systems but requires improved accuracy given its importance for knowledge dissemination.

Method: The authors developed CLAIRE, an agentic system merging LLM reasoning with retrieval to identify incompatible claims and provide contextual evidence for human validation.

Result: CLAIRE enhanced Wikipedia editors' confidence in spotting inconsistencies by 87.5% and improved inconsistency detection by 64.7%. A dataset, WIKICOLLIDE, of real Wikipedia contradictions was created, revealing factual inconsistencies in 3.3% of Wikipedia entries.

Conclusion: Contradictions are a quantifiable issue within Wikipedia. CLAIRE and tools like it present feasible mechanisms to aid editors in maintaining consistency and accuracy at scale.

Abstract: Wikipedia is the largest open knowledge corpus, widely used worldwide and
serving as a key resource for training large language models (LLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Ensuring its accuracy is
therefore critical. But how accurate is Wikipedia, and how can we improve it?
  We focus on inconsistencies, a specific type of factual inaccuracy, and
introduce the task of corpus-level inconsistency detection. We present CLAIRE,
an agentic system that combines LLM reasoning with retrieval to surface
potentially inconsistent claims along with contextual evidence for human
review. In a user study with experienced Wikipedia editors, 87.5% reported
higher confidence when using CLAIRE, and participants identified 64.7% more
inconsistencies in the same amount of time.
  Combining CLAIRE with human annotation, we contribute WIKICOLLIDE, the first
benchmark of real Wikipedia inconsistencies. Using random sampling with
CLAIRE-assisted analysis, we find that at least 3.3% of English Wikipedia facts
contradict another fact, with inconsistencies propagating into 7.3% of FEVEROUS
and 4.0% of AmbigQA examples. Benchmarking strong baselines on this dataset
reveals substantial headroom: the best fully automated system achieves an AUROC
of only 75.1%.
  Our results show that contradictions are a measurable component of Wikipedia
and that LLM-based systems like CLAIRE can provide a practical tool to help
editors improve knowledge consistency at scale.

TL;DR: The paper presents Fin-ExBERT, a framework for extracting user intent-relevant sentences in financial dialogue transcripts using an improved and lightweight BERT model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in sentence-level information extraction from financial dialogue transcripts, such as informal structure, domain-specific vocabulary, and intent variability.

Method: A domain-adapted BERT model is enhanced with LoRA adapters, followed by a two-stage progressive fine-tuning strategy and dynamic thresholding for uncertainty handling.

Result: Fin-ExBERT demonstrates strong precision and F1 score on real-world financial dialogue data with interpretable outputs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective, deployable, and beneficial for downstream tasks like auditing and question-answering in financial settings.

Abstract: Financial dialogue transcripts pose a unique challenge for sentence-level
information extraction due to their informal structure, domain-specific
vocabulary, and variable intent density. We introduce Fin-ExBERT, a lightweight
and modular framework for extracting user intent-relevant sentences from
annotated financial service calls. Our approach builds on a domain-adapted BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) backbone enhanced
with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters, enabling efficient fine-tuning using
limited labeled data. We propose a two-stage training strategy with progressive
unfreezing: initially training a classifier head while freezing the backbone,
followed by gradual fine-tuning of the entire model with differential learning
rates. To ensure robust extraction under uncertainty, we adopt a dynamic
thresholding strategy based on probability curvature (elbow detection),
avoiding fixed cutoff heuristics. Empirical results show strong precision and
F1 performance on real-world transcripts, with interpretable output suitable
for downstream auditing and question-answering workflows. The full framework
supports batched evaluation, visualization, and calibrated export, offering a
deployable solution for financial dialogue mining.

*Wonje Jeung,Sangyeon Yoon,Yoonjun Cho,Dongjae Jeon,Sangwoo Shin,Hyesoo Hong,Albert No*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces A2D (Any-Order, Any-Step Defense), a token-level alignment technique to improve safety in diffusion large language models (dLLMs), effectively countering harmful content attacks and enabling real-time monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion large language models (dLLMs) face challenges with harmful content generation due to their flexibility in generation order, which permits attacks to bypass safety mechanisms.

Method: A2D aligns dLLMs at the token-level using randomized masking to ensure safety. It employs an [EOS] refusal signal whenever harmful content arises, enabling robustness against arbitrary order and prefilling attacks, while also supporting real-time monitoring.

Result: A2D significantly reduces harmful output generation, cutting DIJA attack success rates from over 80% to near-zero across various benchmarks and models.

Conclusion: A2D enhances safety for dLLMs, allowing faster, reliable generation and early termination of unsafe content, making it an effective solution to counter harmful span generation.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) enable any-order generation, but this
flexibility enlarges the attack surface: harmful spans may appear at arbitrary
positions, and template-based prefilling attacks such as DIJA bypass
response-level refusals. We introduce A2D (Any-Order, Any-Step Defense), a
token-level alignment method that aligns dLLMs to emit an [EOS] refusal signal
whenever harmful content arises. By aligning safety directly at the token-level
under randomized masking, A2D achieves robustness to both any-decoding-order
and any-step prefilling attacks under various conditions. It also enables
real-time monitoring: dLLMs may begin a response but automatically terminate if
unsafe continuation emerges. On safety benchmarks, A2D consistently prevents
the generation of harmful outputs, slashing DIJA success rates from over 80% to
near-zero (1.3% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct, 0.0% on Dream-v0-Instruct-7B), and
thresholded [EOS] probabilities allow early rejection, yielding up to 19.3x
faster safe termination.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Policy Reasoning Traces (PRTs), a method to enhance large language models (LLMs) in evaluating policy compliance, showing state-of-the-art results in HIPAA and GDPR contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy compliance requires systematic reasoning, typically performed by human experts, but documenting their processes is resource-intensive.

Method: The authors propose generating specialized reasoning chains (PRTs) that act as bridges to improve LLM accuracy in policy compliance tasks, applicable at both inference and training stages.

Result: PRTs significantly enhance LLM performance in assessing compliance with policies like GDPR and HIPAA, surpassing previous benchmarks and improving citation accuracy.

Conclusion: PRTs not only improve compliance assessment performance but also aid in reasoning and citation capabilities for LLMs, proving their utility in complex policy evaluation tasks.

Abstract: Policy compliance assessment is a fundamental task of evaluating whether an
input case strictly complies with a set of human-defined rules, more generally
known as policies. In practice, human experts follow a systematic, step-by-step
process to identify violations with respect to specific stipulations outlined
in the policy. However, such documentation of gold-standard, expert-level
reasoning processes is costly to acquire. In this paper, we introduce Policy
Reasoning Traces (PRT), a form of specialized generated reasoning chains that
serve as a reasoning bridge to improve an LLM's policy compliance assessment
capabilities. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that the use of PRTs for
both inference-time and training-time scenarios significantly enhances the
performance of open-weight and commercial models, setting a new
state-of-the-art for HIPAA and GDPR policies. Beyond accuracy gains, we also
highlight how PRTs can improve an LLM's ability to accurately cite policy
clauses, as well as influence compliance decisions through their high
utilization from the raw chains of thought.

*Peng Yu,Zeyuan Zhao,Shao Zhang,Luoyi Fu,Xinbing Wang,Ying Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs improve reasoning using a novel framework called SIE, which builds scalable, generalizable, and verifiable environments from structured data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning environments for finetuning LLMs struggle with scalability, generalizability, or verifiability.

Method: The SIE framework autotmatically creates reasoning environments from structured data and enables compositional resonating using explicit schemas, reasoning chains, and rule-based verifiability.

Result: SIE improves in-domain structured reasoning while generalizing to out-of-domain tasks like mathematical and logical reasoning.

Conclusion: The SIE framework enhances reasoning capabilities of LLMs by leveraging structured data in scalable and verifiable ways, including robustness improvements via partial SIE exploration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL) via environmental
exploration. As the intrinsic properties of the environment determine the
abilities that LLMs can learn, the environment plays a important role in the RL
finetuning process. An ideal LLM reasoning environment should possess three
core characteristics: scalability, generalizable reasoning, and verifiability.
However, existing mathematical and coding environments are difficult to scale
due to heavy reliance on expert annotation, while the skills learned in
game-based environments are too specialized to generalize. To bridge this gap,
we introduce the \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{E}nvironment
(SIE) framework. SIE achieves scalability by automatically constructing
reasoning environments from large-scale structured data, where the rich
compositional patterns naturally support generalizable reasoning. Moreover, the
explicit schemas and reasoning chains in structured data provide a foundation
for rule-based verifiability. Experimental results show that SIE framework not
only achieves substantial improvements in in-domain structured reasoning, but
also enables the learned compositional reasoning skills to generalize
effectively to out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. We
further explored learning in information-limited partial SIEs and found that
LLMs can infer the missing information through exploring the environment,
leading to robust reasoning improvements and generalization performance.

*Tiancheng Li,Yuhang Wang,Zhiyang Chen,Zijun Wang,Liyuan Ma,Guo-jun Qi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: C-Evolve is an evolutionary algorithm designed to discover groups of prompts whose aggregated outputs achieve optimal performance via majority voting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether aggregating results from multiple prompts can improve the performance of AI systems, given the limitations of closed-source models' capabilities.

Method: C-Evolve uses an island-based evolutionary algorithm to maintain diverse populations of prompts. Prompts are grouped, assessed by voting scores, and evolved based on their contribution to group performance.

Result: State-of-the-art performance achieved across multiple benchmarks, like HotpotQA (70.67%) and IFBench (43.88%) on Qwen3-8B, surpassing prior methods like GEPA.

Conclusion: C-Evolve effectively improves group performance by leveraging prompt diversity and consensus, demonstrating its competitive advantage in enhancing AI capabilities.

Abstract: Prompt evolution algorithms offer a powerful paradigm for enhancing AI
systems based on closed-source models, while few work explores whether
aggregating results from multiple prompts to reach a consensus can further
advance the system capability boundary. In this paper, we introduce
Consensus-Evolve (C-Evolve), an evolutionary algorithm that discovers a group
of prompts whose aggregated outputs after majority voting achieve optimal
performance. More specifically, C-Evolve employs an island-based evolutionary
algorithm to maintain population diversity, and prompts from distinct islands
are selected to form groups to aggregate their outputs. The key difference from
single individual evolution is a voting score, which evaluates each individual
prompt's contribution within groups. We take this as the fitness score for
evolution instead of individual performance. Consequently, C-Evolve is more
likely to produce and maintain prompts with higher potential to form a
high-performing group and eliminate low-performing ones, gradually improving
the group performance after reaching consensus. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks, including both
open-ended tasks like HotpotQA and closed-ended tasks like MATH. On Qwen3-8B,
C-Evolve achieves 70.67% on HotpotQA and 43.88% on IFBench, which are 4.95% and

is further improved to 47.96% and reaches 95.33% in the MATH benchmark. These
results demonstrate the C-Evolve's competitive performance.

### [197] [Dual-Space Smoothness for Robust and Balanced LLM Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23362)
*Han Yan,Zheyuan Liu,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRISM, a dual-space smoothness framework for improving robustness in Machine Unlearning to address issues like catastrophic forgetting, metric imbalance, and vulnerabilities to attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to tackle concerns associated with user privacy, copyright infringement, and safety within Machine Unlearning, while addressing limitations like over-optimization of one metric and susceptibility to malicious attacks.

Method: The proposed method, PRISM, employs a dual-space smoothness optimization approach. It has two stages: robustly training a probe in representation space to counter jailbreak attacks and optimizing parameter space to resolve gradient conflicts, reduce metric imbalance, and mitigate relearning attacks.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmarks like WMDP and MUSE demonstrate that PRISM surpasses state-of-the-art methods in robustness against attacks and achieves a better trade-off among unlearning effectiveness, utility preservation, and privacy protection.

Conclusion: PRISM provides a significant advancement towards balanced and robust Machine Unlearning frameworks, addressing critical privacy and security challenges while outperforming existing solutions.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models, Machine Unlearning has
emerged to address growing concerns around user privacy, copyright
infringement, and overall safety. Yet state-of-the-art (SOTA) unlearning
methods often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and metric imbalance, for
example by over-optimizing one objective (e.g., unlearning effectiveness,
utility preservation, or privacy protection) at the expense of others. In
addition, small perturbations in the representation or parameter space can be
exploited by relearn and jailbreak attacks. To address these challenges, we
propose PRISM, a unified framework that enforces dual-space smoothness in
representation and parameter spaces to improve robustness and balance
unlearning metrics. PRISM consists of two smoothness optimization stages: (i) a
representation space stage that employs a robustly trained probe to defend
against jailbreak attacks, and (ii) a parameter-space stage that decouples
retain-forget gradient conflicts, reduces imbalance, and smooths the parameter
space to mitigate relearning attacks. Extensive experiments on WMDP and MUSE,
across conversational-dialogue and continuous-text settings, show that PRISM
outperforms SOTA baselines under multiple attacks while achieving a better
balance among key metrics.

### [198] [MedCritical: Enhancing Medical Reasoning in Small Language Models via Self-Collaborative Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23368)
*Xinchun Su,Chunxu Luo,Yixuan Li,Weidong Yang,Lipeng Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedCritical introduces a cost-effective two-stage approach to improve small language models for medical reasoning tasks, enabling them to achieve SOTA performance without direct heavy reliance on large teacher models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models underperform in complex medical reasoning tasks compared to large models, and traditional knowledge distillation methods using teacher models are costly and inefficient.

Method: MedCritical leverages a fine-tuned small language model through a two-stage framework: first extracting thought templates from a teacher model and then employing self-learning via direct preference optimization (DPO).

Result: MedCritical 7B outperforms comparable models like Taiyi and Huatuo-o1-7B on the CMExam benchmark, achieving SOTA results.

Conclusion: MedCritical provides a novel and efficient framework for enhancing small language models' reasoning capabilities, reducing dependency on large teacher models and achieving competitive outcomes.

Abstract: In the field of medicine, complex reasoning tasks such as clinical diagnosis,
treatment planning, and medical knowledge integration pose significant
challenges, where small language models often underperform compared to large
language models like GPT-4 and Deepseek. Recent knowledge distillation-based
methods aim to address these issues through teacher-guided error correction,
but this LLM as judge approach remains challenging in terms of cost, time, and
efficiency. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel two-stage framework,
MedCritical, which uses a small language model fine-tuned by a large teacher
model to play against itself. In the first stage, we extract high-level and
detailed long-chain thought templates from the teacher model to guide the
student model to generate more complex reasoning thoughts. In the second stage,
we introduce direct preference optimization (DPO) through model self-iteration
collaboration to enhance the reasoning ability of the student model by playing
against the correction trajectory of the fine-tuned model during training. This
model self-learning DPO approach teaches the student model to use its own
error-driven insights to consolidate its skills and knowledge to solve complex
problems, and achieves comparable results to traditional knowledge distillation
methods using teacher models at a lower cost. Notably, our MedCritical 7B model
outperforms the Taiyi and Huatuo-o1-7B models by 3.04\% and 10.12\%
respectively on the CMExam benchmark, achieving new SOTA performance among
7B-class small models.

*Junming Yang,Ning Xu,Biao Liu,Shiqi Qiao,Xin Geng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduction of Meta-Weighted Adaptive Preference Optimization (MetaAPO), which improves preference optimization for LLMs by coupling data generation with model training dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of distribution mismatch between offline preference data and the evolving policy of large language models during preference optimization.

Method: MetaAPO utilizes a meta-learner to estimate alignment gaps, guide targeted online data generation, and assign meta-weights to balance online and offline data during optimization.

Result: MetaAPO showed superior performance in various experiments, outperforming other preference optimization methods and achieving a 42% reduction in online annotation costs.

Conclusion: MetaAPO effectively bridges the distribution gap in preference optimization, providing a more dynamic and cost-efficient approach for aligning LLMs with human preferences.

Abstract: Preference optimization is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human values and intentions. A significant challenge in this process is
the distribution mismatch between pre-collected offline preference data and the
evolving model policy. Existing methods attempt to reduce this gap using static
heuristics or decoupled online sampling strategies, but they often fail to
adapt to the model's dynamic learning state. To bridge this gap, we propose
Meta-Weighted Adaptive Preference Optimization (MetaAPO), a novel framework
that dynamically couples data generation with model training. MetaAPO employs a
lightweight meta-learner, as an "alignment gap estimator", to evaluate the
potential benefits of on-policy sampling in relation to offline data. This
guides targeted online generation and assigns sample-wise meta-weights to the
optimization objective, dynamically balancing the quality and distribution of
online and offline data. Experiments on AlpacaEval 2, Arena-Hard and MT-Bench
demonstrate that MetaAPO consistently outperforms existing preference
optimization approaches across various settings, while reducing 42% in online
annotation costs.

### [200] [CCD: Mitigating Hallucinations in Radiology MLLMs via Clinical Contrastive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23379)
*Xi Zhang,Zaiqiao Meng,Jake Lever,Edmond S. L. Ho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of hallucinations (clinically unsupported descriptions) in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for radiology and proposes a lightweight solution called Clinical Contrastive Decoding (CCD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to combat the problem of medical hallucinations generated by radiology-focused MLLMs, which produce outputs that are often clinically unsupported and pose risks in medical contexts.

Method: The proposed method, Clinical Contrastive Decoding (CCD), uses a dual-stage contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during text generation by incorporating structured clinical signals from task-specific radiology expert models. This framework is both training-free and retrieval-free.

Result: Experiments on three datasets and multiple models validate the effectiveness of CCD. On the MIMIC-CXR dataset, the method achieves up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to state-of-the-art radiology report generation models.

Conclusion: CCD offers a lightweight, scalable, and generalizable solution to reduce medical hallucinations in radiology-focused MLLMs, effectively enhancing clinical fidelity without altering base models.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in radiology by integrating visual perception with natural language
understanding. However, they often generate clinically unsupported
descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in
medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through
empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent
in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To
address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Cecoding (CCD), a training-free
and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical
signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage
contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby
enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on
three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves
overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR
dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to
state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and
generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively
bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.

### [201] [Guard Vector: Beyond English LLM Guardrails with Task-Vector Composition and Streaming-Aware Prefix SFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23381)
*Wonhyuk Lee,Youngchol Kim,Yunjin Park,Junhyung Moon,Dongyoung Jeong,Wanjin Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Guard Vector, a tool for improving AI safety task performance and portability by transforming language models with minimal data and compute requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the reliability and safety of language models across multiple languages and architectures while reducing resource demands.

Method: Guard Vector is derived by computing parameter differences between a guardrail model and a pretrained language model. It is then combined with a target language model to create a Target Guard Model (TGM). TGM is adapted via prefix-based training/evaluation and a single-token classifier.

Result: TGM improves classification quality, extends to Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages without additional data, works across models like Llama and Gemma, and enhances throughput via single-token output design.

Conclusion: This approach reduces resource needs, supports multilingual safety applications, and promotes responsible AI usage with improved evaluation processes.

Abstract: We introduce Guard Vector, a safety task vector computed as the parameter
difference between a guardrail model (Guard Model) and a same-architecture
pretrained language model. Composing this vector with a target language model
yields a Target Guard Model (TGM). We then adapt TGM with a streaming-aware
approach that combines prefix-based training and evaluation with a classifier
that produces a single-token output. With this composition alone, TGM improves
classification quality over established Guard Models across standard safety
suites and enables language extensibility to Chinese, Japanese, and Korean,
requiring neither additional training nor target language labels. It also
demonstrates model portability across two widely used public guardrail
backbones, Llama and Gemma. With prefix SFT (supervised fine-tuning), TGM
preserves classification quality under streaming by aligning the behavior
between prefix inputs and full-text inputs. The single-token output design
increases throughput and reduces latency. Together, these components reduce
data and compute requirements while promoting streaming-aware evaluation
practices, thereby contributing to a more responsible AI ecosystem.

### [202] [Train Once, Answer All: Many Pretraining Experiments for the Cost of One](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23383)
*Sebastian Bordt,Martin Pawelczyk*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an approach that enables multiple controlled pretraining experiments with large language models (LLMs) in a single training run to reduce computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretraining LLMs for controlled experiments is computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility. The paper aims to address this constraint.

Method: The authors propose simultaneous execution of multiple pretraining experiments using a single model by incorporating diverse experimental setups within a single 1.5B parameter model trained on 210B tokens.

Result: Findings reveal that the multiple parallel experiments minimally impact overall training dynamics and model performance, demonstrating replicability of prior studies and allowing novel exploration into knowledge acquisition and reasoning.

Conclusion: Simultaneous pretraining experiments are a feasible approach to conducting rigorous research with LLMs while operating under compute budget constraints, although potential experiment interactions should be monitored.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that controlled pretraining experiments are a
powerful tool for understanding learning, reasoning, and memorization in large
language models (LLMs). However, the computational cost of pretraining presents
a significant constraint. To overcome this constraint, we propose to conduct
multiple pretraining experiments simultaneously during a single training run.
We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by conducting ten experiments
during the training of a 1.5B parameter model on 210B tokens. Although we only
train a single model, we can replicate the results from multiple previous works
on data contamination, poisoning, and memorization. We also conduct novel
investigations into knowledge acquisition, mathematical reasoning, and
watermarking. For example, we dynamically update the training data until the
model acquires a particular piece of knowledge. Remarkably, the influence of
the ten experiments on the model's training dynamics and overall performance is
minimal. However, interactions between different experiments may act as a
potential confounder in our approach. We propose to test for interactions with
continual pretraining experiments, finding them to be negligible in our setup.
Overall, our findings suggest that performing multiple pretraining experiments
in a single training run can enable rigorous scientific experimentation with
large models on a compute budget.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRACE is a framework for efficient prompt engineering with large language models, achieving significant performance improvements and low computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in prompt optimization for LLMs, including stability issues and optimization stagnation in local optima.

Method: GRACE integrates two strategies: Gated Refinement (introduces feedback and rejection gates for stability) and Adaptive Compression (distills core concepts when optimization stagnates).

Result: GRACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods with an average relative performance improvement of up to 4.7% across 11 tasks and uses only 25% of the prompt generation budget.

Conclusion: GRACE is an efficient and effective solution for scalable and improved prompt engineering with LLMs, offering both high performance and reduced computational costs.

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for leveraging the full potential of large
language models (LLMs). While automatic prompt optimization offers a scalable
alternative to costly manual design, generating effective prompts remains
challenging. Existing methods often struggle to stably generate improved
prompts, leading to low efficiency, and overlook that prompt optimization
easily gets trapped in local optima. Addressing this, we propose GRACE, a
framework that integrates two synergistic strategies: Gated Refinement and
Adaptive Compression, achieving Efficient prompt optimization. The gated
refinement strategy introduces a feedback regulation gate and an update
rejection gate, which refine update signals to produce stable and effective
prompt improvements. When optimization stagnates, the adaptive compression
strategy distills the prompt's core concepts, restructuring the optimization
trace and opening new paths. By strategically introducing information loss
through refinement and compression, GRACE delivers substantial gains in
performance and efficiency. In extensive experiments on 11 tasks across three
practical domains, including BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), domain-specific, and general
NLP tasks, GRACE achieves significant average relative performance improvements
of 4.7%, 4.4% and 2.7% over state-of-the-art methods, respectively. Further
analysis shows that GRACE achieves these gains using only 25% of the prompt
generation budget required by prior methods, highlighting its high optimization
efficiency and low computational overhead. Our code is available at

*Sherrie Shen,Weixuan Wang,Alexandra Birch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses machine translation challenges with culture-specific terms by introducing the concept of paratextual explicitation, focusing on footnotes and endnotes, and evaluates language models' effectiveness in this context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the difficulties faced by machine translation in conveying complex, context-embedded, and culturally-rooted terms that defy direct linguistic transfer.

Method: The researchers formalized a literary theory on paratexts and created a dataset of 560 expert-aligned paratexts derived from English translations of Liaozhai. They evaluated LLMs in generating paratextual explanations using intrinsic prompting and agent-based retrieval, with human evaluations of their outputs.

Result: Experiments showed that while LLM-generated paratexts can improve audience comprehension, they still fall significantly short of the effectiveness achieved by translator-generated content. Professional translators also demonstrate considerable variability in employing paratexts.

Conclusion: Paratextual explicitation shows potential to enhance machine translation by going beyond direct linguistic equivalence, with applications in cultural mediation, monolingual explanations, and personalized adaptations.

Abstract: The faithful transfer of contextually-embedded meaning continues to challenge
contemporary machine translation (MT), particularly in the rendering of
culture-bound terms--expressions or concepts rooted in specific languages or
cultures, resisting direct linguistic transfer. Existing computational
approaches to explicitating these terms have focused exclusively on in-text
solutions, overlooking paratextual apparatus in the footnotes and endnotes
employed by professional translators. In this paper, we formalize Genette's
(1987) theory of paratexts from literary and translation studies to introduce
the task of paratextual explicitation for MT. We construct a dataset of 560
expert-aligned paratexts from four English translations of the classical
Chinese short story collection Liaozhai and evaluate LLMs with and without
reasoning traces on choice and content of explicitation. Experiments across
intrinsic prompting and agentic retrieval methods establish the difficulty of
this task, with human evaluation showing that LLM-generated paratexts improve
audience comprehension, though remain considerably less effective than
translator-authored ones. Beyond model performance, statistical analysis
reveals that even professional translators vary widely in their use of
paratexts, suggesting that cultural mediation is inherently open-ended rather
than prescriptive. Our findings demonstrate the potential of paratextual
explicitation in advancing MT beyond linguistic equivalence, with promising
extensions to monolingual explanation and personalized adaptation.

*Haowei Hua,Hong Jiao,Dan Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the scoring rationales of humans and large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini in automated essay scoring and investigates scoring consistency and reasoning similarities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing the capability and rationale of LLMs in automated essay scoring to uncover causes of scoring inconsistencies compared to human raters.

Method: The study evaluates the accuracy of GPT-4, Gemini, and similar LLMs using metrics like quadratic weighted kappa and cosine similarity, while exploring rationale clustering via principal component analysis.

Result: LLMs demonstrate strong reasoning abilities, comparable scoring accuracy, and discernible rationale patterns, providing insights into their scoring mechanisms.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to understanding the reasoning processes of LLMs versus human scorers, enhancing automated scoring methodologies.

Abstract: Advances in automated scoring are closely aligned with advances in
machine-learning and natural-language-processing techniques. With recent
progress in large language models (LLMs), the use of ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude,
and other generative-AI chatbots for automated scoring has been explored. Given
their strong reasoning capabilities, LLMs can also produce rationales to
support the scores they assign. Thus, evaluating the rationales provided by
both human and LLM raters can help improve the understanding of the reasoning
that each type of rater applies when assigning a score. This study investigates
the rationales of human and LLM raters to identify potential causes of scoring
inconsistency. Using essays from a large-scale test, the scoring accuracy of
GPT-4o, Gemini, and other LLMs is examined based on quadratic weighted kappa
and normalized mutual information. Cosine similarity is used to evaluate the
similarity of the rationales provided. In addition, clustering patterns in
rationales are explored using principal component analysis based on the
embeddings of the rationales. The findings of this study provide insights into
the accuracy and ``thinking'' of LLMs in automated scoring, helping to improve
the understanding of the rationales behind both human scoring and LLM-based
automated scoring.

*Rajaa El Hamdani,Samy Haffoudhi,Nils Holzenberger,Fabian Suchanek,Thomas Bonald,Fragkiskos D. Malliaros*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Retrieval-Constrained Decoding (RCD), a decoding method to address overly strict evaluation of language models. This method boosts performance by focusing on unique surface forms of answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models often produce correct answers in alternative surface forms that strict evaluations judge as incorrect, leading to underestimated parametric knowledge.

Method: The authors propose the RCD decoding strategy, which restricts model outputs to unique surface forms. They use YAGO-QA, a dataset of 19,137 general knowledge questions for evaluations.

Result: Applying RCD significantly improves the performance of LMs. For example, Llama-3.1-70B achieves 46.0% F1 under RCD compared to 32.3% with standard decoding.

Conclusion: The study highlights that existing evaluation methods undervalue the factual knowledge of LMs. RCD provides a better framework for appreciating model accuracy and knowledge representation.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) encode substantial factual knowledge, but often produce
answers judged as incorrect. We hypothesize that many of these answers are
actually correct, but are expressed in alternative surface forms that are
dismissed due to an overly strict evaluation, leading to an underestimation of
models' parametric knowledge. We propose Retrieval-Constrained Decoding (RCD),
a decoding strategy that restricts model outputs to unique surface forms. We
introduce YAGO-QA, a dataset of 19,137 general knowledge questions. Evaluating
open-source LMs from 135M to 70B parameters, we show that standard decoding
undervalues their knowledge. For instance, Llama-3.1-70B scores only 32.3% F1
with vanilla decoding but 46.0% with RCD. Similarly, Llama-3.1-8B reaches 33.0%
with RCD, outperforming the larger model under vanilla decoding. We publicly
share the code and dataset at https://github.com/Rajjaa/disambiguated-LLM.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents CooT, a dynamic, self-monitoring framework for LLMs to improve safety and social reasoning during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing harmful behaviors and static safety mechanisms in LLMs by creating an adaptable alignment strategy during inference.

Method: Introducing CooT, where a Generator produces text and a Perceiver monitors and intervenes based on hierarchical principles to ensure alignment.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that CooT enhances safety and social reasoning across various benchmarks and model types.

Conclusion: CooT enables dynamic, auditable alignment during inference, offering flexibility and improved control without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but can still exhibit
harmful behaviors. Current alignment strategies typically embed safety into
model weights, making these controls implicit, static, and difficult to modify.
This paper introduces Cognition-of-Thought (CooT), a novel decoding-time
framework that equips LLMs with an explicit cognitive self-monitoring loop.
CooT couples a standard text Generator with a cognitive Perceiver that
continuously monitors the unfolding sequence. The Perceiver uses a structured,
precedence-based hierarchy of principles (e.g., safety over obedience) to
detect potential misalignments as they arise. When violations are flagged, CooT
intervenes by rolling back the generation to the point of error and
regenerating under injected guidance that combines universal social priors with
context-specific warnings. CooT thus transforms alignment from a fixed property
into an explicit, dynamic, and auditable process active during inference,
allowing for flexible policy updates without retraining the model. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families confirm that CooT
consistently improves safety and social reasoning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing item difficulty is crucial for equitable and interpretable test scoring, but traditional methods are costly and time-consuming.

Method: The paper reviews and organizes 37 studies, focusing on text-based machine learning and language models for predicting item difficulty.

Result: Text-based methods show promising predictive accuracy, achieving RMSE as low as 0.165, Pearson correlation up to 0.87, and accuracy up to 0.806.

Conclusion: Automated models are effective for item difficulty prediction, enabling innovation in large-scale assessments, while highlighting the need for further research and practical application.

Abstract: Item difficulty plays a crucial role in test performance, interpretability of
scores, and equity for all test-takers, especially in large-scale assessments.
Traditional approaches to item difficulty modeling rely on field testing and
classical test theory (CTT)-based item analysis or item response theory (IRT)
calibration, which can be time-consuming and costly. To overcome these
challenges, text-based approaches leveraging machine learning and language
models, have emerged as promising alternatives. This paper reviews and
synthesizes 37 articles on automated item difficulty prediction in large-scale
assessment settings published through May 2025. For each study, we delineate
the dataset, difficulty parameter, subject domain, item type, number of items,
training and test data split, input, features, model, evaluation criteria, and
model performance outcomes. Results showed that although classic machine
learning models remain relevant due to their interpretability, state-of-the-art
language models, using both small and large transformer-based architectures,
can capture syntactic and semantic patterns without the need for manual feature
engineering. Uniquely, model performance outcomes were summarized to serve as a
benchmark for future research and overall, text-based methods have the
potential to predict item difficulty with root mean square error (RMSE) as low
as 0.165, Pearson correlation as high as 0.87, and accuracy as high as 0.806.
The review concludes by discussing implications for practice and outlining
future research directions for automated item difficulty modeling.

Motivation: To explore the understudied area of role design within prompts and how it influences large language models (LLMs) in zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Method: Role-based prompt structuring was analyzed using GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama2-7b, and Llama2-13b across datasets for sentiment analysis, text classification, question answering, and math reasoning tasks.

Result: Role-based configurations in prompts improved LLM performance, suggesting the importance of careful prompt design.

engineering has been widely studied, the impact of role design within prompts
remains underexplored. This study examines the influence of role configurations

Conclusion: Leveraging LLMs for active learning in Arabic sentiment analysis can significantly reduce annotation efforts while maintaining high performance, addressing dataset limitations.

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP), particularly sentiment analysis, plays a
vital role in areas like marketing, customer service, and social media
monitoring by providing insights into user opinions and emotions. However,
progress in Arabic sentiment analysis remains limited due to the lack of large,
high-quality labeled datasets. While active learning has proven effective in
reducing annotation efforts in other languages, few studies have explored it in
Arabic sentiment tasks. Likewise, the use of large language models (LLMs) for
assisting annotation and comparing their performance to human labeling is still
largely unexplored in the Arabic context. In this paper, we propose an active
learning framework for Arabic sentiment analysis designed to reduce annotation
costs while maintaining high performance. We evaluate multiple deep learning
architectures: Specifically, long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent
units (GRU), and recurrent neural networks (RNN), across three benchmark
datasets: Hunger Station, AJGT, and MASAC, encompassing both modern standard
Arabic and dialectal variations. Additionally, two annotation strategies are
compared: Human labeling and LLM-assisted labeling. Five LLMs are evaluated as
annotators: GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek Chat, and LLaMA 3
70B Instruct. For each dataset, the best-performing LLM was used: GPT-4o for
Hunger Station, Claude 3 Sonnet for AJGT, and DeepSeek Chat for MASAC. Our
results show that LLM-assisted active learning achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to human labeling. For example, on the Hunger Station
dataset, the LSTM model achieved 93% accuracy with only 450 labeled samples
using GPT-4o-generated labels, while on the MASAC dataset, DeepSeek Chat
reached 82% accuracy with 650 labeled samples, matching the accuracy obtained
through human labeling.

### [212] [On the Shelf Life of Fine-Tuned LLM Judges: Future Proofing, Backward Compatibility, and Question Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23542)
*Janvijay Singh,Austin Xu,Yilun Zhou,Yefan Zhou,Dilek Hakkani-Tur,Shafiq Joty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the practical limitations of finetuned judges used for evaluating model responses, identifying challenges in future-proofing, backward compatibility, and question generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gaps in evaluating and deploying finetuned judges for assessing AI-generated responses, focusing on real-world practicality.

Method: The study uses a structured framework to evaluate the shelf life of judges across varying train-test distributions, finetuning algorithms, and base models in the math domain.

Result: Experiments reveal challenges in future-proofing, ease of backward compatibility, and partial generalization to unseen questions. Continual learning improves adaptability across shifts in response distributions.

Conclusion: The findings highlight limitations in judge models' ability to adapt to evolving generators and unseen questions, informing future directions for robust deployments.

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is widely used in both evaluating free-text model
responses and reward modeling for model alignment and finetuning. Recently,
finetuning judges with judge-specific data has emerged as an often preferred
choice over directly prompting frontier models as judges, as the former
achieves better performance with smaller model sizes while being more robust to
common biases. However, the standard evaluation ignores several practical
concerns of finetuned judges regarding their real world deployment. In this
paper, we identify and formalize three aspects that affect the shelf life of
these judges: future proofing and backward compatibility -- how well judges
finetuned on responses by today's generator models perform on responses by
future models or past models, as well as question generalization -- how well
judges generalize to unseen questions at test time. We study these three
aspects in the math domain under a unified framework with varying train and
test distributions, three SFT- and DPO-based finetuning algorithms and three
different base models. Experiments suggest that future-proofing is challenging
for most models, while backward compatibility is relatively easy, with
DPO-trained models consistently improving performance. We further find that
continual learning provides a more balanced adaptation to shifts between older
and newer response distributions than training solely on stronger or weaker
responses. Moreover, all models observe certain degrees of performance
degradation when moving from questions seen during training to unseen ones,
showing that current judges do not fully generalize to unseen questions. These
findings provide insights into practical considerations for developing and
deploying judge models in the face of ever-changing generators.

### [214] [Towards Efficient CoT Distillation: Self-Guided Rationale Selector for Better Performance with Fewer Rationales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23574)
*Jianzhi Yan,Le Liu,Youcheng Pan,Shiwei Chen,Yang Xiang,Buzhou Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoRSD, a method to improve reasoning ability in small language models (SLMs) by selecting high-quality rationales for chain-of-thought distillation, achieving better performance with fewer, more effective rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to CoT distillation often prioritize data quantity over rationale quality, which risks transferring noisy or incorrect information to smaller models.

Method: The proposed Model-Oriented Rationale Selection Distillation (MoRSD) method identifies and selects high-quality rationales for distillation, using a Rationale Difficulty (RD) metric to assess students' ability to handle specific rationales.

Result: MoRSD achieves a 4.6% average performance improvement across seven datasets and three tasks by leveraging fewer but higher-quality rationales.

Conclusion: Focusing on high-quality rationales rather than exhaustive datasets significantly enhances small models' reasoning abilities, making MoRSD an efficient solution for CoT distillation.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation aims to enhance small language models'
(SLMs) reasoning by transferring multi-step reasoning capability from the
larger teacher models. However, existing work underestimates rationale quality,
focusing primarily on data quantity, which may transfer noisy or incorrect
information to the student model. To address the above issues, we proposed
\textbf{M}odel-\textbf{O}riented \textbf{R}ationale \textbf{S}election
\textbf{D}istillation (MoRSD), which can discern and select high quality
rationales for distillation to improve performance further. We further propose
a Rationale Difficulty (RD) metric to measure the ability of the student model
to generate the correct answer under a given rationale. Compared to the
baseline, we achieved 4.6$\%$ average improvement on seven datasets over three
tasks, using fewer rationales by controlling their accuracy, diversity, and
difficulty. Our results reveal that a small portion of the high quality
rationales can enhance the reasoning ability of student models than the entire
dataset. Our method promises to be a possible solution for efficient CoT
distillation. Our code will be released in https://github.com/Leon221220/MoRSD.

### [215] [Jackal: A Real-World Execution-Based Benchmark Evaluating Large Language Models on Text-to-JQL Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23579)
*Kevin Frank,Anmol Gulati,Elias Lumer,Sindy Campagna,Vamse Kumar Subbiah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Jackal, a benchmark for converting natural language to Jira Query Language (JQL), evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs). Results show varied performance, exposing LLM limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the widespread use of JQL in enterprise teams, no open benchmark exists to map natural language to JQL queries, hindering development and evaluation of effective models.

Method: The authors created Jackal, a large-scale dataset of 100,000 natural language-to-JQL pairs, and evaluated 23 LLMs on a 5,000-pair subset (Jackal-5K). They assessed models using various accuracy metrics and different request types.

Result: The best performing model achieved 60.3% execution accuracy overall but showed variance across request types: Long NL (86.0%), Short NL (35.7%), Semantically Similar (22.7%), and Semantically Exact (99.3%).

Conclusion: Jackal demonstrates the limitations of current LLMs in producing accurate JQL queries and provides a baseline for future research to improve such systems.

Abstract: Enterprise teams rely on the Jira Query Language (JQL) to retrieve and filter
issues from Jira. Yet, to our knowledge, there is no open, real-world,
execution-based benchmark for mapping natural language queries to JQL. We
introduce Jackal, a novel, large-scale text-to-JQL benchmark comprising 100,000
natural language (NL) requests paired with validated JQL queries and
execution-based results on a live Jira instance with over 200,000 issues. To
reflect real-world usage, each JQL query is associated with four types of user
requests: (i) Long NL, (ii) Short NL, (iii) Semantically Similar, and (iv)
Semantically Exact. We release Jackal, a corpus of 100,000 text-to-JQL pairs,
together with an execution-based scoring toolkit, and a static snapshot of the
evaluated Jira instance for reproducibility. We report text-to-JQL results on
23 Large Language Models (LLMs) spanning parameter sizes, open and closed
source models, across execution accuracy, exact match, and canonical exact
match. In this paper, we report results on Jackal-5K, a 5,000-pair subset of
Jackal. On Jackal-5K, the best overall model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieves only
60.3% execution accuracy averaged equally across four user request types.
Performance varies significantly across user request types: (i) Long NL
(86.0%), (ii) Short NL (35.7%), (iii) Semantically Similar (22.7%), and (iv)
Semantically Exact (99.3%). By benchmarking LLMs on their ability to produce
correct and executable JQL queries, Jackal exposes the limitations of current
state-of-the-art LLMs and sets a new, execution-based challenge for future
research in Jira enterprise data.

### [216] [LLM Hallucination Detection: HSAD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23580)
*JinXin Li,Gang Tu,JunJie Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hallucination detection method for large language models (LLMs) based on frequency-domain analysis of their hidden layer signals, called HSAD, to enhance detection accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of hallucinations in large language models, a significant barrier for deploying these models in critical applications. Existing methods are constrained by knowledge coverage and fail to capture reasoning biases, necessitating novel approaches.

Method: The proposed HSAD method treats the reasoning process of LLMs as a cognitive journey, using hidden layer temporal signals. It applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to convert temporal signals into spectral features to detect anomalies and uses these features to design a hallucination detection algorithm.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the spectral features effectively identify hallucinations and the HSAD method surpasses existing models in detection accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: HSAD successfully integrates reasoning process modeling with frequency-domain feature extraction, addressing the limitations of existing methods and advancing the hallucination detection capabilities for LLMs.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in a
wide range of tasks such as language understanding and code generation, the
frequent occurrence of hallucinations during the generation process has become
a significant impediment to their deployment in critical application scenarios.
Current mainstream hallucination detection methods rely on factual consistency
verification or static hidden layer features. The former is constrained by the
scope of knowledge coverage, while the latter struggles to capture reasoning
biases during the inference process. To address these issues, and inspired by
signal analysis methods in cognitive neuroscience, this paper proposes a
hallucination detection method based on the frequency-domain analysis of hidden
layer temporal signals, named HSAD (\textbf{H}idden \textbf{S}ignal
\textbf{A}nalysis-based \textbf{D}etection). First, by treating the LLM's
reasoning process as a cognitive journey that unfolds over time, we propose
modeling and simulating the human process of signal perception and
discrimination in a deception-detection scenario through hidden layer temporal
signals. Next, The Fast Fourier Transform is applied to map these temporal
signals into the frequency domain to construct spectral features, which are
used to capture anomalies that arise during the reasoning process; analysis
experiments on these spectral features have proven the effectiveness of this
approach. Finally, a hallucination detection algorithm is designed based on
these spectral features to identify hallucinations in the generated content. By
effectively combining the modeling of the reasoning process with
frequency-domain feature extraction, the HSAD method overcomes the limitations
of existing approaches in terms of knowledge coverage and the detection of
reasoning biases, demonstrating higher detection accuracy and robustness.

### [217] [Timber: Training-free Instruct Model Refining with Base via Effective Rank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23595)
*Taiqiang Wu,Runming Yang,Tao Liu,Jiahao Wang,Zenan Xu,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the superficiality of post-training on pretrained models and introduces "Timber," a training-free method to address exploration-exploitation trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the perceived superficiality of existing post-training techniques for pretrained models and their limitations in exploration capabilities.

Method: The authors propose "Timber," which refines model weights by partially reverting Instruct models towards their Base counterparts to balance exploration and exploitation capabilities.

Result: Timber consistently improves the performance of Instruct models (like Llama and Qwen) in experiments, especially in Pass@k metrics.

Conclusion: The paper provides new insights into post-training at the weight level and presents a practical, training-free method to refine Instruct models effectively.

Abstract: Post-training, which elicits a pretrained Base model into the corresponding
Instruct model, is widely considered to be superficial. In this work, we first
reinforce this hypothesis by providing novel quantitative evidence from the
weight level that the effective rank (eRank) remains negligibly changed.
However, this superficiality also suffers a critical trade-off, improving the
exploitation capabilities at the cost of limiting its exploration. To tackle
this issue, we propose Timber, a simple yet effective training-free method that
enhances the exploration capability of the Instruct model while preserving its
exploitation. The key insight is to partially revert Instruct towards the
paired Base model by subtle yet targeted refinement of the weight deltas.
Extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen series demonstrate that Timber
consistently improves vanilla Instruct models, particularly on Pass@k
performance. Our findings offer new insights into the post-training stage at
the weight level and practical strategies to refine the Instruct model without
training.

*Haoyu Zheng,Zhuonan Wang,Yuqian Yuan,Tianwei Lin,Wenqiao Zhang,Zheqi Lv,Juncheng Li,Siliang Tang,Yueting Zhuang,Hongyang He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using strategy priors to improve efficiency and accuracy in Large Language Models (LLMs) during reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods in LLMs are resource-intensive, requiring long reasoning traces that lead to higher latency and token usage.

Method: The authors propose a Latent Codebooks framework to learn strategy priors using concise CoT sketches during training. They also introduce GainRouter, which switches between fast and explicit reasoning during inference to enhance efficiency.

Result: The framework achieves competitive or better accuracy in reasoning tasks while significantly reducing inference costs across benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enable more efficient and controllable reasoning in LLMs, offering a practical path for improving performance without increasing computational overhead.

Abstract: Reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on generating
explicit tokens step by step, and their effectiveness typically hinges on
large-scale supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques substantially enhance performance on complex
reasoning tasks, they remain inefficient, requiring long reasoning traces that
increase latency and token usage. In this work, we introduce Latent Codebooks
for Fast Thinking, a framework that uses concise CoT sketches only during
training to learn a codebook of discrete strategy priors. At inference, the
model conditions on a handful of continuous thinking vectors distilled from the
codebook in a single pass, enabling strategy-level guidance without producing
explicit reasoning tokens. To complement this design, we propose GainRouter, a
lightweight routing mechanism that adaptively switches between fast codebook
guided inference and slow explicit reasoning, thereby suppressing overthinking
and reducing unnecessary token generation. Experiments across multiple
reasoning benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while substantially lowering inference cost, offering a practical path
toward efficient and controllable reasoning in large language models.

*Zemin Huang,Yuhang Wang,Zhiyang Chen,Guo-Jun Qi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RemeDi, a Mask-based Diffusion Language Model that uses a remasking mechanism to refine generated texts by identifying and fixing low-quality tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge that existing Mask-based Diffusion Language Models struggle to revise incorrect tokens in generated text.

Method: RemeDi jointly predicts token distributions and per-token confidence scores to identify low-quality tokens, remask them, and resample using richer context. It also employs a remask-aware training pipeline with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: RemeDi achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the remasking mechanism in improving text quality.

Conclusion: The remasking-enabled training and generation mechanism allows Mask-based Diffusion Language Models to conduct more flexible text refinement, overcoming a key limitation of previous systems.

Abstract: Mask-based Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) struggle to revise incorrect
tokens: once a token is generated, it typically remains fixed. The key
challenge is to identify potential errors in the inputs. In this paper, we
propose \emph{\underline{Rem}asking-\underline{e}nabled \underline{Di}ffusion
Language Model (RemeDi}, a mask-based DLM that introduces \emph{remasking} as
another fundamental mechanism, enabling more flexible text refinement in
diffusion-based text generation. To achieve this, RemeDi jointly predicts token
distributions and per-token confidence scores at each step. The confidence
scores determine which tokens to be unmasked after the current step, allowing
the model to identify tokens with low quality and remask them. These remasked
tokens can be resampled with richer context in subsequent steps. We design a
remask-aware pipeline to train this ability, including supervised fine-tuning
which teaches the model to detect and remask incorrect tokens in addition to
predict mask tokens, and reinforcement learning which optimizes full generation
trajectories toward higher rewards. Experiments show that RemeDi achieves the
state-of-the-art results among open-source DLMs on multiple datasets.

*Shulin Huang,Yiran Ding,Junshu Pan,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper systematically investigates the cross-lingual reasoning generalization capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL) versus supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and enhance the cross-lingual generalization and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, focusing on the comparative benefits of RL and SFT.

Method: The authors used Qwen2.5-3B-Base as the base model to conduct experiments across various multilingual reasoning tasks, investigating results for both RL and SFT methods.

Result: RL demonstrated higher accuracy and stronger cross-lingual generalization than SFT. Additionally, RL training on non-English data yielded better performance overall compared to training on English data.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning equips language models with more robust reasoning strategies, especially for cross-lingual tasks, providing a superior alternative to SFT.

Abstract: Enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)
attracts widespread attention. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown
superior performance for improving complex reasoning, its impact on
cross-lingual generalization compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) remains
unexplored. We present the first systematic investigation into cross-lingual
reasoning generalization of RL and SFT. Using Qwen2.5-3B-Base as our foundation
model, we conduct experiments on diverse multilingual reasoning benchmarks,
including math reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and scientific reasoning. Our
investigation yields two significant findings: (1) Tuning with RL not only
achieves higher accuracy but also demonstrates substantially stronger
cross-lingual generalization capabilities compared to SFT. (2) RL training on
non-English data yields better overall performance and generalization than
training on English data, which is not observed with SFT. Furthermore, through
comprehensive mechanistic analyses, we explore the underlying factors of RL's
superiority and generalization across languages. Our results provide compelling
evidence that RL enables the model with more robust reasoning strategies,
offering crucial guidance for more equitable and effective multilingual
reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of substantial performance gaps in large language models (LLMs) across different languages, proposing a batch-wise alignment strategy that improves non-English language accuracy while preserving overall capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face global reliability challenges in multilingual enterprise applications due to their English-focused training, resulting in decreased performance in mid/low-resource languages.

Method: The authors use a batch-wise alignment strategy utilizing semantically equivalent multilingual data to fine-tune LLMs, aligning model outputs across multiple languages effectively.

Result: The proposed approach improves non-English accuracy by up to 23.9%, while maintaining English performance, reasoning abilities, and retrieval quality.

Conclusion: This method enhances multilingual robustness in LLMs, offering scalable and practical solutions for equitable AI in industrial applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain unreliable for global enterprise
applications due to substantial performance gaps between high-resource and
mid/low-resource languages, driven by English-centric pretraining and internal
reasoning biases. This inconsistency undermines customer experience and
operational reliability in multilingual settings such as customer support,
content moderation, and information retrieval. Even with advanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, we observe up to an 29% accuracy
drop in non-English languages compared to English.
  We propose a practical, batch-wise alignment strategy for fine-tuning LLMs,
leveraging semantically equivalent multilingual data in each training batch to
directly align model outputs across languages. This approach improves
non-English accuracy by up to 23.9\% without compromising English performance,
model reasoning, or retrieval quality. Our method is simple to implement,
scalable, and integrates seamlessly with existing LLM training \& deployment
pipelines, enabling more robust and equitable multilingual AI solutions in
industry.

Motivation: To evaluate and improve the nuanced reasoning and decision-making capabilities of MLLMs in complex, human-centric environments, addressing limitations in existing approaches.

Method: The paper introduces a benchmark (VIVA+) comprising 1,317 real-world situations and 6,373 multiple-choice questions across three reasoning dimensions: comprehension, action justification, and reflective reasoning. It also evaluates models through targeted training and multi-step reasoning.

Result: Performance patterns of commercial and open-source models were revealed, showing consistent improvements following targeted training and reasoning strategies.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs have distinct challenges in reasoning and decision-making. The VIVA+ benchmark offers insights to advance their contextual and socially-aware decision-making abilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promising results for embodied
agents in operating meaningfully in complex, human-centered environments. Yet,
evaluating their capacity for nuanced, human-like reasoning and decision-making
remains challenging. In this work, we introduce VIVA+, a cognitively grounded
benchmark for evaluating the reasoning and decision-making of MLLMs in
human-centered situations. VIVA+ consists of 1,317 real-world situations paired
with 6,373 multiple-choice questions, targeting three core abilities for
decision-making: (1) Foundational Situation Comprehension, (2) Context-Driven
Action Justification, and (3) Reflective Reasoning. Together, these dimensions
provide a systematic framework for assessing a model's ability to perceive,
reason, and act in socially meaningful ways. We evaluate the latest commercial
and open-source models on VIVA+, where we reveal distinct performance patterns
and highlight significant challenges. We further explore targeted training and
multi-step reasoning strategies, which yield consistent performance
improvements. Finally, our in-depth analysis highlights current model
limitations and provides actionable insights for advancing MLLMs toward more
robust, context-aware, and socially adept decision-making in real-world

*Zhiqiang Liu,Yichi Zhang,Mengshu Sun,Lei Liang,Wen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces M-Hyper, a novel method for multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC), which combines fused and independent modality representations to improve accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMKGC methods struggle with either loss of modality-specific information in fusion-based approaches or inadequate cross-modal interaction in ensemble-based approaches.

Method: M-Hyper leverages quaternion algebra and introduces specialized modules (FERF and R2MF) for robust handling of modality-specific and fused representations, later mapped into a biquaternion framework.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance, improved robustness, and computational efficiency of M-Hyper compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: M-Hyper effectively integrates fusion-based and ensemble-based approaches, offering flexibility, better context-dependent semantic interaction, and robust modality-specific representation for MMKGC applications.

Abstract: Multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to discover missing facts
in multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) by leveraging both structural
relationships and diverse modality information of entities. Existing MMKGC
methods follow two multi-modal paradigms: fusion-based and ensemble-based.
Fusion-based methods employ fixed fusion strategies, which inevitably leads to
the loss of modality-specific information and a lack of flexibility to adapt to
varying modality relevance across contexts. In contrast, ensemble-based methods
retain modality independence through dedicated sub-models but struggle to
capture the nuanced, context-dependent semantic interplay between modalities.
To overcome these dual limitations, we propose a novel MMKGC method M-Hyper,
which achieves the coexistence and collaboration of fused and independent
modality representations. Our method integrates the strengths of both
paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal interactions while maintaining
modality-specific information. Inspired by ``quaternion'' algebra, we utilize
its four orthogonal bases to represent multiple independent modalities and
employ the Hamilton product to efficiently model pair-wise interactions among
them. Specifically, we introduce a Fine-grained Entity Representation
Factorization (FERF) module and a Robust Relation-aware Modality Fusion (R2MF)
module to obtain robust representations for three independent modalities and
one fused modality. The resulting four modality representations are then mapped
to the four orthogonal bases of a biquaternion (a hypercomplex extension of
quaternion) for comprehensive modality interaction. Extensive experiments
indicate its state-of-the-art performance, robustness, and computational
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring road safety by mastering traffic rules and enhancing explanations for driving law comprehension, particularly in less-resourced languages.

Method: The study examines the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, compares text-only versus multimodal systems, and investigates domain-specific fine-tuning of large LLMs such as Llama and RoLlama.

Result: SOTA models perform well, and fine-tuned 8B models are competitive. Text descriptions of images are superior to direct visual inputs. An LLM-as-a-Judge reveals a bias in explanation quality assessment.

Conclusion: The research advances explainable QA for Romanian driving laws and highlights fine-tuned models as promising alternatives to SOTA approaches.

Abstract: Ensuring that both new and experienced drivers master current traffic rules
is critical to road safety. This paper evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs)
on Romanian driving-law QA with explanation generation. We release a
1{,}208-question dataset (387 multimodal) and compare text-only and multimodal
SOTA systems, then measure the impact of domain-specific fine-tuning for Llama
3.1-8B-Instruct and RoLlama 3.1-8B-Instruct. SOTA models perform well, but
fine-tuned 8B models are competitive. Textual descriptions of images outperform
direct visual input. Finally, an LLM-as-a-Judge assesses explanation quality,
revealing self-preference bias. The study informs explainable QA for
less-resourced languages.

*Yucheng Wang,Yifan Hou,Aydin Javadov,Mubashara Akhtar,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores challenges in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), identifying reasoning bottlenecks related to modality integration rather than perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address conflicting reports on the performance impact of added modalities in multimodal reasoning by introducing a structured evaluation framework.

Method: The authors categorized multimodal reasoning into six interaction patterns and conducted empirical evaluations to identify performance bottlenecks and systematic failures.

Result: Additional modalities improved reasoning only when providing independent and sufficient paths but reduced performance in redundant or chained scenarios. Bottlenecks include task-composition and fusion biases.

Conclusion: Integration is the main barrier to effective multimodal reasoning, and improvements can be achieved through composition-aware training and better fusion control mechanisms.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) promise enhanced reasoning by
integrating diverse inputs such as text, vision, and audio. Yet cross-modal
reasoning remains underexplored, with conflicting reports on whether added
modalities help or harm performance. These inconsistencies stem from a lack of
controlled evaluation frameworks and analysis of models' internals to isolate
when and why modality interactions support or undermine reasoning. We address
this gap through a logic-grounded evaluation framework that categorizes
multimodal reasoning into six interaction patterns, varying how facts are
distributed across modalities and logically combined. Empirically, additional
modalities enhance reasoning only when they provide independent and sufficient
reasoning paths, while redundant or chained entailment support often hurts
performance. Moreover, reasoning degrades in three systematic ways: weaker
modalities drag down overall performance, conflicts bias preference toward
certain modalities, and joint signals from different modalities fail to be
integrated effectively. Therefore, we identify two core failures:
task-composition bottleneck, where recognition and reasoning cannot be jointly
executed in one pass, and fusion bottleneck, where early integration introduces
bias. For further investigation, we find that attention patterns fail to encode
fact usefulness, but a simple two-step prompting (recognize then reason)
restores performance, confirming the task-composition bottleneck. Moreover,
modality identity remains recoverable in early layers, and softening attention
in early fusion improves reasoning, highlighting biased fusion as another
failure mode. Overall, our findings show that integration, not perception, is
the main barrier to multimodal reasoning, suggesting composition-aware training
and early fusion control as promising directions.

### [226] [Understanding Textual Capability Degradation in Speech LLMs via Parameter Importance Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23755)
*Chao Wang,Rui-Chen Zheng,Yang Ai,Zhen-Hua Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Speech integration into LLMs decreases their textual ability. The study analyzes this issue, identifying a parameter distribution shift, and tests methods to maintain textual competence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate the reduction in textual competence observed in speech-enabled LLMs.

Method: Analysis using parameter importance estimation, layer-wise learning rate scheduling, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

Result: Proposed methods better preserved textual competence while enhancing spoken question answering performance compared to full fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Mitigation strategies maintain textual distribution and improve performance, with their effectiveness linked to the structural properties of LLMs.

Abstract: The integration of speech into Large Language Models (LLMs) has substantially
expanded their capabilities, but often at the cost of weakening their core
textual competence. This degradation limits the ability of speech-enabled LLMs
to fully exploit their pre-trained text-based knowledge. In this work, we
analyze the underlying mechanisms of this issue through a focused study of the
widely used encoder-adaptor paradigm. We propose an analytical framework based
on parameter importance estimation, which reveals that fine-tuning for speech
introduces a textual importance distribution shift: the layer-wise allocation
of parameters critical to textual reasoning is disrupted. Building on this
insight, we investigate two mitigation strategies: layer-wise learning rate
scheduling and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), both aim to preserve the original
parameter distribution. Experimental results show that both approaches better
maintain textual competence than full fine-tuning, while also improving
downstream spoken question answering performance. Furthermore, our analysis
offers a principled explanation for the effectiveness of the proposed
mitigation strategies, linking their benefits to the structural properties of
textual knowledge in LLMs.

*Junliang Li,Yucheng Wang,Yan Chen,Yu Ran,Ruiqing Zhang,Jing Liu,Hua Wu,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces KLCF, a novel reinforcement learning framework aimed at reducing hallucinations and factuality deficits in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face challenges in managing hallucinations and ensuring content consistency due to overlooking a model's internal knowledge limitations during long-form generation.

Method: The proposed KLCF framework uses pretrained knowledge boundaries for fact-checking and introduces a self-assessment module to improve factual recall and precision without relying on external knowledge.

Result: Experiments show that KLCF significantly enhances factuality metrics across various benchmarks and mitigates hallucination issues.

Conclusion: KLCF demonstrates effectiveness in addressing reliability challenges in large-scale language model generation by being efficient, lightweight, and externally knowledge-free.

Abstract: Hallucination and factuality deficits remain key obstacles to the reliability
of large language models (LLMs) in long-form generation. Existing reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) frameworks primarily rely on preference
rewards, yet they often overlook the model's internal knowledge boundaries,
exacerbating the so-called "hallucination tax". To address this challenge, we
propose Knowledge-Level Consistency Reinforcement Learning Framework (KLCF), a
novel framework that focuses on the knowledge consistency between the policy
model's expressed knowledge and the base model's parametric knowledge, and
introduces a Dual-Fact Alignment mechanism to jointly optimize factual recall
and precision. Specifically, KLCF leverages pretrained knowledge boundaries to
construct fact checklist, guiding online reinforcement learning to improve
factual coverage and recall; simultaneously, it trains a self-assessment module
based on the base model's internal knowledge to enhance factual precision
during generation. Unlike prior methods that rely on external retrieval or
heavy verification, our reward design is fully external-knowledge-free and
lightweight, making KLCF efficient and easily scalable to large-scale training.
Experimental results demonstrate that KLCF substantially improves factuality
metrics across multiple long-form benchmarks and effectively alleviates model
hallucinations.

### [228] [From Personal to Collective: On the Role of Local and Global Memory in LLM Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23767)
*Zehong Wang,Junlin Wu,ZHaoxuan Tan,Bolian Li,Xianrui Zhong,Zheli Liu,Qingkai Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in personalizing large language models (LLMs) by introducing a local-global memory framework (LoGo) to balance personal and collective knowledge for improved user experiences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the cold-start and biasing problems in LLM personalization, which stem from an inability to effectively utilize collective knowledge across users.

Method: The authors propose a local-global memory framework (LoGo) that combines personalized local memory with collective global knowledge, and employ a mediator module to resolve conflicts between the two memory sources.

Result: The proposed LoGo framework consistently improves personalization quality for LLMs, effectively warming up cold-start users and reducing bias introduced by skewed user histories.

Conclusion: Incorporating collective knowledge enhances LLM personalization, as demonstrated by LoGo's success in improving accuracy across various benchmarks and scenarios.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to tailor model behavior to
individual users based on their historical interactions. However, its
effectiveness is often hindered by two key challenges: the \textit{cold-start
problem}, where users with limited history provide insufficient context for
accurate personalization, and the \textit{biasing problem}, where users with
abundant but skewed history cause the model to overfit to narrow preferences.
We identify both issues as symptoms of a common underlying limitation, i.e.,
the inability to model collective knowledge across users. To address this, we
propose a local-global memory framework (LoGo) that combines the personalized
local memory with a collective global memory that captures shared interests
across the population. To reconcile discrepancies between these two memory
sources, we introduce a mediator module designed to resolve conflicts between
local and global signals. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LoGo consistently improves personalization quality by both
warming up cold-start users and mitigating biased predictions. These results
highlight the importance of incorporating collective knowledge to enhance LLM
personalization.

### [229] [Bridging the Knowledge-Prediction Gap in LLMs on Multiple-Choice Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23782)
*Yoonah Park,Haesung Pyun,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates why Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with multiple-choice questions (MCQs) despite possessing the necessary knowledge and introduces a geometry-based solution, KAPPA, to improve prediction alignment and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the discrepancy between LLMs' latent knowledge and their ability to make correct predictions on MCQs.

Method: The authors analyze the model's hidden states and identify two key bases—a knowledge basis and a prediction basis—then propose KAPPA to align these bases using a parameter-free projection-based adjustment.

Result: KAPPA consistently improves accuracy on benchmarks such as Big-Bench-Hard and ARC-Challenge, outperforming baseline methods. Additionally, it shows generalization capabilities across tasks and works effectively on free-form questions.

Conclusion: The work provides a geometric perspective on the knowledge-prediction gap in LLMs and proposes a practical method, KAPPA, to improve model alignment with latent knowledge.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail on multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
despite demonstrating correct knowledge in other contexts, such as free-form
generation. To investigate the mechanism underlying this knowledge-prediction
gap on MCQs and alleviate it, we conduct a probing analysis and find that
residual streams in certain layers contain a subspace spanned by two important
bases: a \emph{knowledge basis} that encodes the probability of the
ground-truth answer for a given MCQ and a \emph{prediction basis} that encodes
the probability of the answer choice predicted by the model. We observe that
incorrect predictions arise from a misalignment of the model's hidden states
along these two bases. Hence, we introduce \textbf{KAPPA} (Knowledge-Aligned
Prediction through Projection-based Adjustment), a parameter-free intervention
that transforms the hidden states to align the prediction coordinate with the
knowledge coordinate within this subspace. Experiments on binary-choice
reformulations of Big-Bench-Hard and ARC-Challenge show that KAPPA
substantially improves accuracy and consistently outperforms baselines. While
optimal subspaces differ across tasks, subspaces generalize to some extent, as
supported by cross-dataset experiments. Moreover, KAPPA extends its
effectiveness to free-form questions beyond MCQs. Our work provides a new
geometric understanding of the knowledge-prediction gap and offers a practical
method for better aligning model behavior with its latent knowledge.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid retrieval-augmented generation system improves Islamic knowledge understanding and reasoning, achieving up to 25% performance increase across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in understanding and reasoning about Islamic knowledge.

Method: The paper proposes a three-stage RAG pipeline: using BM25 for initial retrieval, a dense embedding model for semantic matching, and cross-encoder reranking for more precise retrieval.

Result: The system improves accuracy by up to 25% depending on the task, with the highest configuration achieving 45% accuracy for Subtask 1 and 80% for Subtask 2.

Conclusion: The hybrid RAG approach significantly enhances LLM performance in knowledge retrieval tasks, particularly with the Fanar model.

Abstract: This paper presents our submission to the QIAS 2025 shared task on Islamic
knowledge understanding and reasoning. We developed a hybrid
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that combines sparse and dense
retrieval methods with cross-encoder reranking to improve large language model
(LLM) performance. Our three-stage pipeline incorporates BM25 for initial
retrieval, a dense embedding retrieval model for semantic matching, and
cross-encoder reranking for precise content retrieval. We evaluate our approach
on both subtasks using two LLMs, Fanar and Mistral, demonstrating that the
proposed RAG pipeline enhances performance across both, with accuracy
improvements up to 25%, depending on the task and model configuration. Our best
configuration is achieved with Fanar, yielding accuracy scores of 45% in
Subtask 1 and 80% in Subtask 2.

*Arti Rani,Shweta Singh,Nihar Ranjan Sahoo,Gaurav Kumar Nayak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents OpenBiasBench for evaluating biases in QA tasks and introduces Open-DeBias to mitigate a wide range of known and unseen biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing bias mitigation methods that only handle predefined bias categories and do not generalize to new or context-specific biases.

Method: Developed OpenBiasBench benchmark and proposed Open-DeBias, a method using adapter modules for data-efficient and parameter-efficient bias mitigation in QA tasks.

Result: Open-DeBias achieved significant improvements in QA accuracy on BBQ datasets and demonstrated excellent generalization across languages and tasks, including StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs.

Conclusion: Open-DeBias offers a robust and multilingual solution for addressing both known and emergent biases in various NLP tasks, ensuring fairness and trustworthiness in QA models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success on question
answering (QA) tasks, yet they often encode harmful biases that compromise
fairness and trustworthiness. Most existing bias mitigation approaches are
restricted to predefined categories, limiting their ability to address novel or
context-specific emergent biases. To bridge this gap, we tackle the novel
problem of open-set bias detection and mitigation in text-based QA. We
introduce OpenBiasBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate biases
across a wide range of categories and subgroups, encompassing both known and
previously unseen biases. Additionally, we propose Open-DeBias, a novel,
data-efficient, and parameter-efficient debiasing method that leverages adapter
modules to mitigate existing social and stereotypical biases while generalizing
to unseen ones. Compared to the state-of-the-art BMBI method, Open-DeBias
improves QA accuracy on BBQ dataset by nearly $48\%$ on ambiguous subsets and
$6\%$ on disambiguated ones, using adapters fine-tuned on just a small fraction
of the training data. Remarkably, the same adapters, in a zero-shot transfer to
Korean BBQ, achieve $84\%$ accuracy, demonstrating robust language-agnostic
generalization. Through extensive evaluation, we also validate the
effectiveness of Open-DeBias across a broad range of NLP tasks, including
StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs, highlighting its robustness, multilingual strength,
and suitability for general-purpose, open-domain bias mitigation. The project

*Ziyi Yang,Weizhou Shen,Ruijun Chen,Chenliang Li,Fanqi Wan,Ming Yan,Xiaojun Quan,Fei Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SPELL, a self-play reinforcement learning framework to improve long-context reasoning in LLMs without requiring labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the lag in long-context reasoning progress for LLMs due to the complexity of processing extended text and a lack of reliable annotations and reward signals.

Method: SPELL uses a self-play framework with three integrated roles (questioner, responder, verifier). It optimizes performance through reinforcement learning, adaptive curriculum, and reward functions tailored to model capabilities.

Result: SPELL demonstrated consistent improvement across six benchmarks, outperforming LLMs fine-tuned on annotated data, and achieved a notable performance increase on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking.

Conclusion: SPELL enables scalable, label-free enhancement of long-context reasoning for LLMs, with promising results that point toward potential scaling for more advanced models.

Abstract: Progress in long-context reasoning for large language models (LLMs) has
lagged behind other recent advances. This gap arises not only from the
intrinsic difficulty of processing long texts, but also from the scarcity of
reliable human annotations and programmatically verifiable reward signals. In
this paper, we propose SPELL, a multi-role self-play reinforcement learning
framework that enables scalable, label-free optimization for long-context
reasoning. SPELL integrates three cyclical roles-questioner, responder, and
verifier-within a single model to enable continual self-improvement. The
questioner generates questions from raw documents paired with reference
answers; the responder learns to solve these questions based on the documents;
and the verifier evaluates semantic equivalence between the responder's output
and the questioner's reference answer, producing reward signals to guide
continual training. To stabilize training, we introduce an automated curriculum
that gradually increases document length and a reward function that adapts
question difficulty to the model's evolving capabilities. Extensive experiments
on six long-context benchmarks show that SPELL consistently improves
performance across diverse LLMs and outperforms equally sized models fine-tuned
on large-scale annotated data. Notably, SPELL achieves an average 7.6-point
gain in pass@8 on the strong reasoning model Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking, raising
its performance ceiling and showing promise for scaling to even more capable
models.

### [233] [Winning the Pruning Gamble: A Unified Approach to Joint Sample and Token Pruning for Efficient Supervised Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23873)
*Shaobo Wang,Jiaming Wang,Jiajun Zhang,Cong Wang,Yue Min,Zichen Wen,Fei Huang,Huiqiang Jiang,Junyang Lin,Dayiheng Liu,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework, Q-Tuning, to improve data efficiency in supervised fine-tuning of large language models by combining sample and token pruning into a unified approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies in existing data pruning methods for fine-tuning LLMs, which either operate on sample or token levels in isolation, leading to suboptimal utilization of training data.

Method: The method introduces the Error-Uncertainty Plane for analyzing data utility and a two-stage framework, Q-Tuning, to first filter data at the sample level and then perform asymmetric token pruning on selected samples.

Result: Q-Tuning achieves a +38% improvement in performance over baseline fine-tuning methods on SmolLM2-1.7B while using only 12.5% of the original training data. It also sets new state-of-the-art results across five benchmarks.

Conclusion: Q-Tuning demonstrates that a dynamic pruning approach can consistently outperform full-data training, offering a scalable and practical solution for maximizing data efficiency under budget constraints.

Abstract: As supervised fine-tuning (SFT) evolves from a lightweight post-training step
into a compute-intensive phase rivaling mid-training in scale, data efficiency
has become critical for aligning large language models (LLMs) under tight
budgets. Existing data pruning methods suffer from a fragmented design: they
operate either at the sample level or the token level in isolation, failing to
jointly optimize both dimensions. This disconnect leads to significant
inefficiencies--high-value samples may still contain redundant tokens, while
token-level pruning often discards crucial instructional or corrective signals
embedded in individual examples. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the
Error-Uncertainty (EU) Plane, a diagnostic framework that jointly characterizes
the heterogeneous utility of training data across samples and tokens. Guided by
this insight, we propose Quadrant-based Tuning (Q-Tuning), a unified framework
that strategically coordinates sample pruning and token pruning. Q-Tuning
employs a two-stage strategy: first, it performs sample-level triage to retain
examples rich in informative misconceptions or calibration signals; second, it
applies an asymmetric token-pruning policy, using a context-aware scoring
mechanism to trim less salient tokens exclusively from misconception samples
while preserving calibration samples in their entirety. Our method sets a new
state of the art across five diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, on SmolLM2-1.7B,
Q-Tuning achieves a +38\% average improvement over the full-data SFT baseline
using only 12.5\% of the original training data. As the first dynamic pruning
approach to consistently outperform full-data training, Q-Tuning provides a
practical and scalable blueprint for maximizing data utilization in
budget-constrained LLM SFT.

*Yibo Yan,Guangwei Xu,Xin Zou,Shuliang Liu,James Kwok,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DocPruner, a framework for adaptive patch-level embedding pruning in Visual Document Retrieval (VDR) to reduce storage overhead while maintaining retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-vector methods for VDR, though effective, have high storage requirements that hinder large-scale deployments.

Method: DocPruner uses intra-document patch attention distribution to dynamically identify and discard redundant embeddings in visually-rich document pages, enabling storage reduction.

Result: DocPruner achieves a 50-60% reduction in storage for multi-vector VDR models with minimal impact on retrieval performance.

Conclusion: DocPruner offers a practical and efficient way to build scalable, storage-efficient VDR systems by leveraging adaptive embedding pruning.

Abstract: Visual Document Retrieval (VDR), the task of retrieving visually-rich
document pages using queries that combine visual and textual cues, is crucial
for numerous real-world applications. Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in a multi-vector paradigm, representing
each document as patch-level embeddings to capture fine-grained details. While
highly effective, this approach introduces a critical challenge: prohibitive
storage overhead, as storing hundreds of vectors per page makes large-scale
deployment costly and impractical. To address this, we introduce DocPruner, the
first framework to employ adaptive patch-level embedding pruning for VDR to
effectively reduce the storage overhead. DocPruner leverages the intra-document
patch attention distribution to dynamically identify and discard redundant
embeddings for each document. This adaptive mechanism enables a significant
50-60% reduction in storage for leading multi-vector VDR models with negligible
degradation in document retrieval performance. Extensive experiments across
more than ten representative datasets validate that DocPruner offers a robust,
flexible, and effective solution for building storage-efficient, large-scale
VDR systems.

### [235] [Taming Masked Diffusion Language Models via Consistency Trajectory Reinforcement Learning with Fewer Decoding Step](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23924)
*Jingyi Yang,Guanxu Chen,Xuhao Hu,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores tailored decoding strategies and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs), addressing challenges of inference consistency and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While MDLMs offer advantages like parallel decoding and flexibility, decoding strategies and RL methods optimized for MDLMs remain underdeveloped. This paper questions if directly applying techniques from autoregressive models to MDLMs is effective.

Method: The authors propose two decoding mechanisms (EOSER and ASS) to improve MDLM inference efficiency and a new RL algorithm, CJ-GRPO, designed to ensure consistency between rollout and optimization trajectories.

Result: Experiments on mathematical and planning benchmarks with an 8-billion parameter model demonstrate that the proposed techniques achieve competitive performance with fewer decoding steps.

Conclusion: The proposed methods—EOSER, ASS, and CJ-GRPO—make significant strides in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of MDLMs, enabling them to perform full diffusion-style decoding and reducing optimization errors.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) language models, offering properties such as
parallel decoding, flexible generation orders, and the potential for fewer
inference steps. Despite these advantages, decoding strategies and
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms tailored for MDLMs remain underexplored.
A naive approach is to directly transfer techniques well-established for AR
models to MDLMs. However, this raises an immediate question: Is such a naive
transfer truly optimal? For example, 1) Block-wise and semi-AR decoding
strategies are not employed during the training of MDLMs, so why do they
outperform full diffusion-style decoding during inference? 2) Applying RL
algorithms designed for AR models directly to MDLMs exhibits a
training-inference inconsistency, since MDLM decoding are non-causal
(parallel). This results in inconsistencies between the rollout trajectory and
the optimization trajectory. To address these challenges, we propose EOS Early
Rejection (EOSER) and Ascending Step-Size (ASS) decoding scheduler, which
unlock the potential of MDLMs to perform full diffusion-style decoding,
achieving competitive performance with fewer decoding steps. Additionally, we
introduce Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO)
for taming MDLMs, which emphasizes the consistency between rollout trajectory
and optimization trajectory, and reduces the optimization errors caused by
skip-step optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning tasks,
such as mathematical and planning benchmarks, using LLaDA-8B-Instruct. The
results demonstrate that the proposed EOSER and ASS mechanisms, together with
CJ-GRPO, hold significant promise for effectively and efficiently taming MDLMs.

### [236] [Assessing Large Language Models in Updating Their Forecasts with New Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23936)
*Zhangdie Yuan,Zifeng Ding,Andreas Vlachos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces EVOLVECAST, a framework to evaluate how large language models (LLMs) update their predictions with new information beyond their training data, comparing them to human forecasters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research lacked focus on dynamic prediction and confidence adjustment by LLMs as new evidence emerges.

Method: The EVOLVECAST framework evaluates LLMs by analyzing their prediction shifts and confidence calibration when presented with information unavailable during their training, using comparisons to human forecasters.

Result: LLMs showed some responsiveness but their updates were inconsistent and overly conservative. Both verbalized and logits-based confidence measures failed to match human standards of performance.

Conclusion: LLMs display a conservative bias and lack robust mechanisms for belief updating, highlighting the need for improvement in prediction adjustment techniques.

Abstract: Prior work has largely treated future event prediction as a static task,
failing to consider how forecasts and the confidence in them should evolve as
new evidence emerges. To address this gap, we introduce EVOLVECAST, a framework
for evaluating whether large language models appropriately revise their
predictions in response to new information. In particular, EVOLVECAST assesses
whether LLMs adjust their forecasts when presented with information released
after their training cutoff. We use human forecasters as a comparative
reference to analyze prediction shifts and confidence calibration under updated
contexts. While LLMs demonstrate some responsiveness to new information, their
updates are often inconsistent or overly conservative. We further find that
neither verbalized nor logits-based confidence estimates consistently
outperform the other, and both remain far from the human reference standard.
Across settings, models tend to express conservative bias, underscoring the
need for more robust approaches to belief updating.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents Easy Turn, an open-source, bimodal turn-taking detection model that outperforms existing solutions, along with a new 1,145-hour training dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges in achieving robust turn-taking detection for full-duplex human-machine communication, noting the drawbacks of existing models such as lack of open-source availability, large parameter sizes, and single-modality focus.

Method: The authors propose Easy Turn, a modular turn-taking detection model that integrates acoustic and linguistic information to classify dialogue into four states. They also release a large training dataset, Easy Turn trainset, for this purpose.

Result: Easy Turn achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in turn-taking detection, outperforming existing open-source models like TEN Turn Detection and Smart Turn V2, as validated on the Easy Turn testset.

Conclusion: Easy Turn simplifies the development of full-duplex systems by offering an open-source, high-performance model and dataset. This can significantly advance the research and practical implementation of natural human-machine interaction.

Abstract: Full-duplex interaction is crucial for natural human-machine communication,
yet remains challenging as it requires robust turn-taking detection to decide
when the system should speak, listen, or remain silent. Existing solutions
either rely on dedicated turn-taking models, most of which are not
open-sourced. The few available ones are limited by their large parameter size
or by supporting only a single modality, such as acoustic or linguistic.
Alternatively, some approaches finetune LLM backbones to enable full-duplex
capability, but this requires large amounts of full-duplex data, which remain
scarce in open-source form. To address these issues, we propose Easy Turn, an
open-source, modular turn-taking detection model that integrates acoustic and
linguistic bimodal information to predict four dialogue turn states: complete,
incomplete, backchannel, and wait, accompanied by the release of Easy Turn
trainset, a 1,145-hour speech dataset designed for training turn-taking
detection models. Compared to existing open-source models like TEN Turn
Detection and Smart Turn V2, our model achieves state-of-the-art turn-taking
detection accuracy on our open-source Easy Turn testset. The data and model
will be made publicly available on GitHub.

*Claudio Fantinuoli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vision-Grounded Interpreting (VGI), incorporating visual input to enhance machine interpreting against unimodal challenges. Results show improved lexical disambiguation but modest or no gains in some ambiguity resolutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine interpreting systems rely solely on linguistic signals, which limit their performance in handling ambiguities needing visual, situational, or pragmatic cues.

Method: Developed a prototype system combining a vision-language model to use speech and webcam visual input, evaluated with a hand-crafted diagnostic corpus focused on disambiguating three types of ambiguities.

Result: Visual integration notably improves lexical disambiguation, provides modest and inconsistent gains in gender resolution, and fails to enhance resolution of syntactic ambiguities.

Conclusion: Multimodal approaches are critical for improving machine interpreting quality, particularly in addressing contextual disambiguation challenges.

Abstract: Machine Interpreting systems are currently implemented as unimodal, real-time
speech-to-speech architectures, processing translation exclusively on the basis
of the linguistic signal. Such reliance on a single modality, however,
constrains performance in contexts where disambiguation and adequacy depend on
additional cues, such as visual, situational, or pragmatic information. This
paper introduces Vision-Grounded Interpreting (VGI), a novel approach designed
to address the limitations of unimodal machine interpreting. We present a
prototype system that integrates a vision-language model to process both speech
and visual input from a webcam, with the aim of priming the translation process
through contextual visual information. To evaluate the effectiveness of this
approach, we constructed a hand-crafted diagnostic corpus targeting three types
of ambiguity. In our evaluation, visual grounding substantially improves
lexical disambiguation, yields modest and less stable gains for gender
resolution, and shows no benefit for syntactic ambiguities. We argue that
embracing multimodality represents a necessary step forward for advancing
translation quality in machine interpreting.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes the HiPO framework, which helps LLMs decide when to use detailed reasoning versus direct responses, reducing token usage while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the inefficiency and high token usage caused by always generating detailed reasoning traces with LLMs.

Method: HiPO integrates a hybrid data pipeline for reasoning responses and a reinforcement learning reward system to strike a balance between accuracy and efficiency.

Result: HiPO substantially reduces token length and either maintains or improves accuracy in benchmark tests for mathematics and coding.

Conclusion: HiPO is a promising framework for efficient adaptive reasoning in resource-constrained, real-world scenarios using LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning to improve accuracy on complex tasks. However, always generating
lengthy reasoning traces is inefficient, leading to excessive token usage and
higher inference costs. This paper introduces the Hybrid Policy Optimization
(i.e., HiPO), a framework for adaptive reasoning control that enables LLMs to
selectively decide when to engage in detailed reasoning (Think-on) and when to
respond directly (Think-off). Specifically, HiPO combines a hybrid data
pipelineproviding paired Think-on and Think-off responseswith a hybrid
reinforcement learning reward system that balances accuracy and efficiency
while avoiding over-reliance on detailed reasoning. Experiments across
mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate that HiPO can substantially
reduce token length while maintaining or improving accuracy. Finally, we hope
HiPO a can be a principled approach for efficient adaptive reasoning, advancing
the deployment of reasoning-oriented LLMs in real-world, resource-sensitive
settings.

*Haonan Wang,Junfeng Sun,Xingdi Yuan,Ruoyao Wang,Ziang Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ByteSized32Refactored, an optimized and modular implementation of ByteSized32, improving code efficiency for text game generation with extensibility for future scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Large Language Models face challenges in simulating interactive world models, specifically in the creation and extension of text game environments.

Method: The researchers refactored the original ByteSized32 corpus by modularizing its structure, centralizing shared logic into GameBasic.py library with 7 reusable base classes, reducing code complexity and size from 20k to 10k Python lines.

Result: Experiments using GPT-4o showed mixed performance with improvements in two out of four evaluation dimensions in unseen scenarios, but also declines in the other two, highlighting challenges with hierarchical structures.

Conclusion: The refactored modular design allows more efficient extension and LLM adaptivity to new scenarios while establishing a scalable and reusable text game development framework.

Abstract: Simulating interactive world models remains a core challenge in Large
Language Models(LLMs). In this work, we introduce the ByteSized32Refactored, a
refactored, modular, and extensible implementation of the original ByteSized32
corpus to explore the task of text game generation. We further optimize the
code structure of each text game and create the GameBasic.py foundation
library, which centralizes common logic across all 32 games by abstracting 7
base classes (GameObject, etc.) into reusable modules, thereby reducing from
20k to 10k total lines of Python code compared to the original Bytesized32. Our
refactored implementation enables extendability - with our centralized design,
ByteSized32Refactored can be more efficiently extended to include text games of
new scenarios and specifications by reusing the shared logic and
functionalities. Extensive experiments with GPT-4o demonstrate a mix of
performance - with Bytesized32Refactored, the generated text games for unseen
scenarios showcase quality improvements on two of the four evaluation
dimensions while decreases on the other two, indicating that the hierarchical
structure of the refactored code presents new challenges for LLMs. Overall, we
highlight that our extensible code structure, centered on the foundation
library and the modular optimization, not only facilitates LLM adaptation to
environment specifications but also establishes a scalable environment that
supports future extensions.

### [241] [The Hidden Costs of Translation Accuracy: Distillation, Quantization, and Environmental Impact](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23990)
*Dhaathri Vijay,Anandaswarup Vadapalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the environmental and computational trade-offs of large language models, finding that model compression strategies like distillation and quantization significantly reduce carbon emissions and computational demand while retaining high translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The massive computational and environmental costs of large language models necessitate finding ways to reduce these costs without significantly compromising performance.

Method: The study compared full-scale, distilled, and quantized models in machine translation tasks using the Flores+ benchmark and human evaluations across three languages. Carbon emissions per model run were analyzed.

Result: The full 3.3B fp32 model exhibited the highest BLEU scores but also the largest environmental impact. Distilled models were up to 4.5x faster with minimal quality loss, and aggressive quantization (INT4) preserved fluency and accuracy. Trade-offs were noted in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: Model compression strategies, including distillation and quantization, present viable ways to mitigate computational and environmental costs while maintaining competitive translation performance. Frameworks for NLP evaluation should include sustainability alongside traditional metrics.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs) has heightened concerns
about their computational and environmental costs. This study investigates the
trade-offs between translation quality and efficiency by comparing full-scale,
distilled, and quantized models using machine translation as a case study. We
evaluated performance on the Flores+ benchmark and through human judgments of
conversational translations in French, Hindi, and Kannada. Our analysis of
carbon emissions per evaluation run revealed that the full 3.3B fp32 model,
while achieving the highest BLEU scores, incurred the largest environmental
footprint (about 0.007-0.008 kg CO2 per run). The distilled models achieved an
inference of up to 4.5x faster than the full 3.3B model, with only minimal
reductions in BLEU scores. Human evaluations also showed that even aggressive
quantization (INT4) preserved high levels of accuracy and fluency, with
differences between models generally minor. These findings demonstrate that
model compression strategies can substantially reduce computational demands and
environmental impact while maintaining competitive translation quality, though
trade-offs are more pronounced in low-resource settings. We argue for
evaluation frameworks that integrate efficiency and sustainability alongside
objective metrics as central dimensions of progress in NLP.

*Gauri Kholkar,Ratinder Ahuja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating the translation of design documents into enforceable AI guardrails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the safety and regulatory compliance of autonomous AI agents in industry by bridging the policy-to-practice gap.

Method: The framework constructs a verifiable policy tree from technical artifacts, using LLMs to interpret and enforce natural language policies through prompt-based classifiers.

Result: The approach successfully validated across different applications, establishing its scalability and auditable nature.

Conclusion: The developed pipeline offers a robust system for creating safer, more regulatable AI through automated policy enforcement.

Abstract: As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in industry, it is
essential to safeguard them. We introduce a novel framework that automates the
translation of unstructured design documents into verifiable, real-time
guardrails. We introduce "Policy as Prompt," a new approach that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to interpret and enforce natural language policies by
applying contextual understanding and the principle of least privilege. Our
system first ingests technical artifacts to construct a verifiable policy tree,
which is then compiled into lightweight, prompt-based classifiers that audit
agent behavior at runtime. We validate our approach across diverse
applications, demonstrating a scalable and auditable pipeline that bridges the
critical policy-to-practice gap, paving the way for verifiably safer and more
regulatable AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MCPMark introduces a benchmark to test external system interactions by LLMs, addressing gaps in complexity and realism of existing benchmarks with diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' ability to interact deeply and systematically with external systems.

Method: MCPMark includes 127 tasks created by domain experts and AI agents, defined by CRUD operations, with curated initial states and automatic verification scripts.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows LLMs typically require significant execution turns and tool calls; gpt-5-medium performs best but achieves only 52.56% pass@1.

Conclusion: MCPMark effectively stress-tests LLMs, exposing substantial limitations in current models to handle realistic workflows and interaction complexities.

Abstract: MCP standardizes how LLMs interact with external systems, forming the
foundation for general agents. However, existing MCP benchmarks remain narrow
in scope: they focus on read-heavy tasks or tasks with limited interaction
depth, and fail to capture the complexity and realism of real-world workflows.
To address this gap, we propose MCPMark, a benchmark designed to evaluate MCP
use in a more realistic and comprehensive manner. It consists of $127$
high-quality tasks collaboratively created by domain experts and AI agents.
Each task begins with a curated initial state and includes a programmatic
script for automatic verification. These tasks demand richer and more diverse
interactions with the environment, involving a broad range of create, read,
update, and delete (CRUD) operations. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
cutting-edge LLMs using a minimal agent framework that operates in a
tool-calling loop. Empirical results show that the best-performing model,
gpt-5-medium, reaches only $52.56$\% pass@1 and $33.86$\% pass^4, while other
widely regarded strong models, including claude-sonnet-4 and o3, fall below
$30$\% pass@1 and $15$\% pass^4. On average, LLMs require $16.2$ execution
turns and $17.4$ tool calls per task, significantly surpassing those in
previous MCP benchmarks and highlighting the stress-testing nature of MCPMark.

*Yangzhou Liu,Yue Cao,Hao Li,Gen Luo,Zhe Chen,Weiyun Wang,Xiaobo Liang,Biqing Qi,Lijun Wu,Changyao Tian,Yanting Zhang,Yuqiang Li,Tong Lu,Yu Qiao,Jifeng Dai,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sequential Diffusion Language Model (SDLM), which adapts autoregressive language models to achieve efficient and flexible decoding while maintaining competitive performance and improved throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-length decoding and the incompatibility with key-value caches limit the efficiency of diffusion language models (DLMs). Additionally, block diffusion methods, though somewhat mitigating these issues, require fixed block sizes and expensive training.

Method: This paper introduces Next Sequence Prediction (NSP), combining next-token and next-block prediction, and integrates it into the proposed Sequential Diffusion Language Model (SDLM). SDLM retrofits pre-trained autoregressive language models (ALMs) to dynamically decode sequences based on model confidence, enabling flexibility in generation length, preserving key-value cache compatibility, and enhancing robustness.

Result: SDLM achieves comparable or better performance than strong autoregressive baselines with minimal training data (3.5M samples) while improving throughput by 2.1 times over Qwen-2.5. The SDLM-32B model also showcases significant scalability and efficiency potential.

Conclusion: The Sequential Diffusion Language Model (SDLM) combines flexibility, efficiency, and competitive performance by retrofitting pre-trained models, offering strong scalability and throughput gains for diffusion language modeling.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have strong theoretical efficiency but are
limited by fixed-length decoding and incompatibility with key-value (KV)
caches. Block diffusion mitigates these issues, yet still enforces a fixed
block size and requires expensive training. We introduce Next Sequence
Prediction (NSP), which unifies next-token and next-block prediction, enabling
the model to adaptively determine the generation length at each step. When the
length is fixed to 1, NSP reduces to standard next-token prediction. Building
on NSP, we propose Sequential Diffusion Language Model (SDLM), which can
retrofit pre-trained autoregressive language models (ALMs) at minimal cost.
Specifically, SDLM performs diffusion inference within fixed-size mask blocks,
but dynamically decodes consecutive subsequences based on model confidence,
thereby preserving KV-cache compatibility and improving robustness to varying
uncertainty and semantics across the sequence. Experiments show that SDLM
matches or surpasses strong autoregressive baselines using only 3.5M training
samples, while achieving 2.1 higher throughput than Qwen-2.5. Notably, the
SDLM-32B model delivers even more pronounced efficiency gains, demonstrating
the strong scalability potential of our modeling paradigm. Project page and

### [245] [SparseD: Sparse Attention for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24014)
*Zeqing Wang,Gongfan Fang,Xinyin Ma,Xingyi Yang,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SparseD, a sparse attention method tailored for diffusion language models (DLMs) to improve inference latency while retaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DLMs experience high inference latency due to the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms with respect to context length.

Method: SparseD pre-computes head-specific sparse patterns once, reuses them across all denoising steps, and employs full attention during early denoising before switching to sparse attention later.

Result: SparseD achieves up to 1.50× speedup over FlashAttention at 64k context lengths using 1,024 denoising steps without compromising generation quality.

Conclusion: SparseD is a practical and efficient solution for long-context DLM applications, addressing latency challenges while maintaining performance.

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) offer a promising alternative to
autoregressive models (ARs), existing open-source DLMs suffer from high
inference latency. This bottleneck is mainly due to the attention's quadratic
complexity with respect to context length in computing all query-key pairs.
Intuitively, to reduce this complexity, a natural strategy is to restrict
attention to sparse patterns that retain only the most relevant connections.
Such approaches are well-established in ARs, where attention follows fixed and
clearly defined sparse patterns. However, in DLMs, we observe distinct sparsity
behaviors: (1) attention patterns vary across heads, (2) attention patterns in
each head remain highly similar across denoising steps, and (3) early denoising
steps are critical for generation. These findings render sparse attention
methods designed for ARs largely incompatible with DLMs, as they fail to
capture head-specific structures and risk degrading generation when applied in
early denoising steps. To address these challenges, we propose SparseD, a novel
sparse attention method for DLMs. Leveraging the observations, SparseD only
requires pre-computing head-specific sparse patterns one time, and reuses them
across all steps. This prevents recomputing sparse patterns at each denoising
step. Meanwhile, SparseD uses full attention in the early steps, then switches
to sparse attention later to maintain generation quality. Together, these
establish SparseD as a practical and efficient solution for deploying DLMs in
long-context applications. Experimental results demonstrate that SparseD
achieves lossless acceleration, delivering up to $1.50\times$ speedup over
FlashAttention at a 64k context length with 1,024 denoising steps.

### [246] [ResFormer: All-Time Reservoir Memory for Long Sequence Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24074)
*Hongbo Liu,Jia Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ResFormer is a neural network architecture designed to handle varying context lengths efficiently, outperforming existing models in both accuracy and memory efficiency for sequence classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of Transformer-based models, which face challenges with long input lengths due to high computational complexity.

Method: Introduced ResFormer, integrating a reservoir computing network for long-term dependencies and using Transformer architecture for short-term dependencies.

Result: ResFormer achieved up to +22.3% accuracy improvement over baselines (e.g., DeepSeek-Qwen, ModernBERT) on EmoryNLP dataset and consistent gains on other datasets.

Conclusion: ResFormer efficiently models extensive contextual information, improving both performance and memory usage for sequence classification tasks.

Abstract: Sequence classification is essential in NLP for understanding and
categorizing language patterns in tasks like sentiment analysis, intent
detection, and topic classification. Transformer-based models, despite
achieving state-of-the-art performance, have inherent limitations due to
quadratic time and memory complexity, restricting their input length. Although
extensive efforts have aimed at reducing computational demands, processing
extensive contexts remains challenging.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose ResFormer, a novel neural network
architecture designed to model varying context lengths efficiently through a
cascaded methodology. ResFormer integrates an reservoir computing network
featuring a nonlinear readout to effectively capture long-term contextual
dependencies in linear time. Concurrently, short-term dependencies within
sentences are modeled using a conventional Transformer architecture with
fixed-length inputs.
  Experiments demonstrate that ResFormer significantly outperforms baseline
models of DeepSeek-Qwen and ModernBERT, delivering an accuracy improvement of
up to +22.3% on the EmoryNLP dataset and consistent gains on MultiWOZ, MELD,
and IEMOCAP. In addition, ResFormer exhibits reduced memory consumption,
underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency in modeling extensive contextual
information.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses sentiment analysis in multiple languages using an ensemble of transformer models and a large language model, achieving over 86% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome sentiment analysis challenges in foreign languages without labeled training data, addressing its increasing importance in industries like marketing and politics.

Method: An ensemble of pre-trained sentiment analysis models (bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment and XLM-R) was applied to a multilingual dataset. A large language model was also incorporated.

Result: Sentiment analysis achieved more than 86% performance accuracy through their proposed approach.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances sentiment analysis capabilities for foreign languages using transformer-based models and large language models, demonstrating promising results.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a very important natural language processing activity
in which one identifies the polarity of a text, whether it conveys positive,
negative, or neutral sentiment. Along with the growth of social media and the
Internet, the significance of sentiment analysis has grown across numerous
industries such as marketing, politics, and customer service. Sentiment
analysis is flawed, however, when applied to foreign languages, particularly
when there is no labelled data to train models upon. In this study, we present
a transformer ensemble model and a large language model (LLM) that employs
sentiment analysis of other languages. We used multi languages dataset.
Sentiment was then assessed for sentences using an ensemble of pre-trained
sentiment analysis models: bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment, and XLM-R.
Our experimental results indicated that sentiment analysis performance was more
than 86% using the proposed method.

*Matteo Boffa,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Large-Scale Constraint Generation (LSCG) to test Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to parse extensive and fine-grained constraints, proposing the dedicated FoCusNet model to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research fails to evaluate how LLMs perform when faced with handling large-scale and detailed constraints, necessitating an exploration of this capability.

Method: The authors create a practical instance of LSCG called Words Checker and analyze LLM performance based on model characteristics and prompting techniques. They also propose FoCusNet, a specialized model to filter and focus on relevant constraints.

Result: Experiments show existing solutions experience major performance deterioration with growing constraints, while FoCusNet improves accuracy by 8-13%.

Conclusion: FoCusNet effectively enhances LLM performance for tasks requiring parsing of large constraint sets, addressing limitations of existing solutions.

Abstract: Recent research has explored the constrained generation capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) when explicitly prompted by few task-specific
requirements. In contrast, we introduce Large-Scale Constraint Generation
(LSCG), a new problem that evaluates whether LLMs can parse a large,
fine-grained, generic list of constraints. To examine the LLMs' ability to
handle an increasing number constraints, we create a practical instance of
LSCG, called Words Checker. In Words Checker, we evaluate the impact of model
characteristics (e.g., size, family) and steering techniques (e.g., Simple
Prompt, Chain of Thought, Best of N) on performance. We also propose FoCusNet,
a small and dedicated model that parses the original list of constraints into a
smaller subset, helping the LLM focus on relevant constraints. Experiments
reveal that existing solutions suffer a significant performance drop as the
number of constraints increases, with FoCusNet showing an 8-13% accuracy boost.

*Kaiyu He,Peilin Wu,Mian Zhang,Kun Wan,Wentian Zhao,Xinya Du,Zhiyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEAR, a label-free evaluation paradigm for studying abductive reasoning in LLMs, focusing on hypothesis generation and evaluation using three metrics: consistency, generalizability, and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether and how large language models can discover new knowledge, with a focus on their ability to generate plausible hypotheses for explaining observations.

Method: The authors designed GEAR, a label-free, automated evaluation framework that scores hypothesis sets using metrics like consistency, generalizability, and diversity. They conducted experiments on nine LLMs and proposed a momentum-based curriculum to improve model learning.

Result: GEAR enabled analysis of 50,000 candidate hypotheses across benchmarks, uncovering differences in model performance. The momentum-based curriculum improved GEAR metrics and performance on abductive reasoning tasks without gold-label supervision.

Conclusion: GEAR demonstrates a scalable and principled method to evaluate abductive reasoning and train LLMs to produce higher-quality hypotheses. Its label-free framework provides robust training signals for improving model diversity and reliability.

Abstract: Since the advent of large language models (LLMs), research has focused on
instruction following and deductive reasoning. A central question remains: can
these models discover new knowledge, and how can we evaluate this ability? We
address this by studying abductive reasoning-the generation of plausible
hypotheses to explain observations-and introduce GEAR (General Evaluation for
Abductive Reasoning), a general-purpose, fully automated, transparent, and
label-free evaluation paradigm. GEAR scores hypothesis sets by three metrics:
consistency (each hypothesis explains the observations), generalizability
(consistent hypotheses make meaningful predictions on unseen inputs), and
diversity (the set covers distinct predictions and patterns). Built this way,
GEAR is scalable (no human gold answers), reliable (deterministic scoring
aligned with classical abduction), and open-ended (scores improve only when
models produce new plausible hypotheses, unlike static benchmarks that saturate
once accuracy is high). Using GEAR, we conduct a fine-grained study of nine
LLMs on four abduction benchmarks with 1,500 problems, generating over 50,000
candidate hypotheses and revealing model differences obscured by gold-answer or
purely human evaluations. We further propose a momentum-based curriculum that
adjusts GEAR-derived training data by learning velocity: it starts with what
the model learns quickly and shifts toward harder objectives such as generating
diverse hypotheses once the model is confident on foundational objectives.
Without gold-label supervision, this strategy improves all GEAR objectives and
these gains transfer to established abductive reasoning benchmarks. Taken
together, GEAR provides a principled framework that evaluates abduction and
supplies label-free, scalable training signals that help LLMs produce more
diverse and reliable hypotheses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces BTC-SAM, a framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate diverse and rich test cases for identifying biases in Sentiment Analysis models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social biases in Sentiment Analysis models can cause harm in real-world applications, but constructing diverse test cases to identify these biases is resource-intensive.

Method: The BTC-SAM framework uses LLMs for controllable generation of test sentences, minimizing manual specification while ensuring linguistic diversity and variation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that BTC-SAM provides better test coverage and handles previously unseen biases effectively compared to base prompting methods.

Conclusion: The framework proves promising for bias testing in SA models by achieving high-quality, comprehensive test cases using LLMs with reduced resource dependency.

Abstract: Sentiment Analysis (SA) models harbor inherent social biases that can be
harmful in real-world applications. These biases are identified by examining
the output of SA models for sentences that only vary in the identity groups of
the subjects. Constructing natural, linguistically rich, relevant, and diverse
sets of sentences that provide sufficient coverage over the domain is
expensive, especially when addressing a wide range of biases: it requires
domain experts and/or crowd-sourcing. In this paper, we present a novel bias
testing framework, BTC-SAM, which generates high-quality test cases for bias
testing in SA models with minimal specification using Large Language Models
(LLMs) for the controllable generation of test sentences. Our experiments show
that relying on LLMs can provide high linguistic variation and diversity in the
test sentences, thereby offering better test coverage compared to base
prompting methods even for previously unseen biases.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method to improve the generalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) in moral reasoning by using pragmatic inference methods grounded in moral foundations theory, and demonstrates the effectiveness experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are motivated by the challenge of achieving generalization in moral reasoning for LLMs, which struggle because they focus on distributional semantics rather than pragmatic moral operations.

Method: The authors introduce pragmatic inference methods based on moral foundations theory, which guide LLMs to incorporate contextual information and align moral foundations with reasoning objectives.

Result: The experimental results show that the proposed approach improves LLMs' ability to generalize in moral reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The study concludes that pragmatic inference methods grounded in moral foundations theory significantly enhance LLMs' moral reasoning, providing a strong base for future research in this area.

Abstract: Moral reasoning has emerged as a promising research direction for Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet achieving generalization remains a central
challenge. From a linguistic standpoint, this difficulty arises because LLMs
are adept at capturing distributional semantics, which fundamentally differs
from the morals which operate at the pragmatic level. This paper investigates
how LLMs can achieve generalized moral reasoning despite their reliance on
distributional semantics. We propose pragmatic inference methods grounded in
moral foundations theory, which leverage contextual information at each step to
bridge the pragmatic gap and guide LLMs in connecting moral foundations with
moral reasoning objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances LLMs' generalization in moral reasoning, providing a
foundation for future research grounded in moral foundations theory.

TL;DR: GLoW introduces an innovative dual-scale world model method for "hard-exploration" tasks in LLM-based agents, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the Jericho benchmark suite and drastically reducing environment interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard-exploration tasks requiring new knowledge acquisition remain a key challenge for LLM-based agents.

Method: GLoW uses dual-scale world models with a Multi-path Advantage Reflection mechanism. It maintains a global trajectory frontier and infers progress signals locally to enhance exploration efficiency.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance among LLM-based approaches in text-based games in the Jericho benchmark, with 100-800x fewer environment interactions compared to RL-based methods.

Conclusion: GLoW demonstrates that LLM-based approaches can rival or exceed RL methods in hard-exploration tasks, offering significant efficiency improvements in terms of interactions.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have seen promising advances, yet they are still limited in
"hard-exploration" tasks requiring learning new knowledge through exploration.
We present GLoW, a novel approach leveraging dual-scale world models,
maintaining a trajectory frontier of high-value discoveries at the global
scale, while learning from local trial-and-error in exploration through a
Multi-path Advantage Reflection mechanism which infers advantage-based progress
signals to guide exploration. To evaluate our framework for hard-exploration,
we tackle the Jericho benchmark suite of text-based games, where GLoW achieves
a new state-of-theart performance for LLM-based approaches. Compared to
state-of-the-art RLbased methods, our approach achieves comparable performance
while requiring 100-800x fewer environment interactions.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the brittleness of automated prompt optimization methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) and introduces the concept of textual sharpness in semantic spaces. It proposes and evaluates two novel frameworks, TARE and ATARE, which enhance prompt robustness against paraphrase variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to mitigate the brittleness of automated prompt optimization methods for LLMs, where semantically similar paraphrases can lead to large performance fluctuations, undermining reliability.

Method: The paper proposes TARE, leveraging adversarial paraphrasing and robust selection, along with ATARE, which introduces adaptive semantic neighborhood shaping to ensure robust prompt selection.

Result: Experiments show that TARE and ATARE produce prompts that are robust to paraphrasing, achieve higher accuracy compared to existing methods, and leverage computationally practical solutions.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of addressing textual sharpness in prompt optimization, presenting TARE and ATARE as effective frameworks to enhance reliability and robustness in LLM performances.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) hinges on carefully
engineered prompts. However, prevailing prompt optimization methods, ranging
from heuristic edits and reinforcement learning to evolutionary search,
primarily target point-wise accuracy. They seldom enforce paraphrase invariance
or searching stability, and therefore cannot remedy this brittleness in
practice. Automated prompt search remains brittle: small, semantically
preserving paraphrases often cause large performance swings. We identify this
brittleness as the textual sharpness of the prompt landscape. In this work, we
provide the first formal treatment of textual sharpness in the discrete,
semantic space of prompts, together with an operational robustness criterion
over a semantic neighborhood; the design is black-box or API-only, requiring no
gradients to update the model's parameters. Then we introduce TARE (Textual
Sharpness-Aware Evolving), a derivative-free framework that alternates between
an inner, sampling-based adversarial search that stresses a prompt with hard
paraphrases and an outer, robust selection that prefers candidates whose
neighborhoods remain strong. We further propose ATARE, which learns anisotropic
weights to shape the semantic neighborhood and adapts its radius over time to
balance exploration and fidelity. Diverse tasks evaluate our methods, whose
design for minimizing textual sharpness gap leads to prompts that preserve
accuracy under paraphrasing, outperforming accuracy-only prompt search while
remaining computationally practical.

*Yida Chen,Yuning Mao,Xianjun Yang,Suyu Ge,Shengjie Bi,Lijuan Liu,Saghar Hosseini,Liang Tan,Yixin Nie,Shaoliang Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called LLM-proposed Open Taxonomy (LOT) to compare reasoning behaviors of large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating a human-readable classification system. LOT identifies distinguishing features between LRMs and links these differences to performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding regarding whether and how different LRMs reason in distinct ways, as existing analyses focus mainly on task accuracy and reasoning length.

Method: The LOT method uses a generative language model to classify reasoning traces from different LRMs, highlighting their distinctive features. These features are then used to predict the source model, iteratively constructing a readable taxonomy characterizing reasoning behaviors.

Result: LOT accurately distinguishes reasoning traces from LRMs with 80-100% accuracy, analyzing 12 open-source LRMs across tasks like math, science, and coding. The taxonomy reveals systematic reasoning differences.

Conclusion: LOT not only distinguishes reasoning patterns between LRMs but also provides qualitative insights into their reasoning styles. Aligning reasoning styles across model scales improves performance, demonstrating real-world utility.

Abstract: Current comparisons of large reasoning models (LRMs) focus on macro-level
statistics such as task accuracy or reasoning length. Whether different LRMs
reason differently remains an open question. To address this gap, we introduce
the LLM-proposed Open Taxonomy (LOT), a classification method that uses a
generative language model to compare reasoning traces from two LRMs and
articulate their distinctive features in words. LOT then models how these
features predict the source LRM of a reasoning trace based on their empirical
distributions across LRM outputs. Iterating this process over a dataset of
reasoning traces yields a human-readable taxonomy that characterizes how models
think. We apply LOT to compare the reasoning of 12 open-source LRMs on tasks in
math, science, and coding. LOT identifies systematic differences in their
thoughts, achieving 80-100% accuracy in distinguishing reasoning traces from
LRMs that differ in scale, base model family, or objective domain. Beyond
classification, LOT's natural-language taxonomy provides qualitative
explanations of how LRMs think differently. Finally, in a case study, we link
the reasoning differences to performance: aligning the reasoning style of
smaller Qwen3 models with that of the largest Qwen3 during test time improves
their accuracy on GPQA by 3.3-5.7%.

### [256] [Localizing Task Recognition and Task Learning in In-Context Learning via Attention Head Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24164)
*Haolin Yang,Hakaze Cho,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates how large language models perform in-context learning, identifying and analyzing specific attention heads responsible for task recognition and task learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanistic foundations of in-context learning (ICL) by combining attention-head analysis with broader ICL task decomposition.

Method: They propose a Task Subspace Logit Attribution (TSLA) framework to identify attention heads specialized in task recognition and learning, supported by correlation analysis, ablation studies, and input perturbations.

Result: Attention heads were found to independently and effectively handle task recognition and learning components of ICL, aligning and rotating hidden states in task subspace to improve predictions.

Conclusion: The framework reconciles prior studies while offering a unified understanding of how large language models execute diverse tasks in ICL, emphasizing the complementary roles of attention heads.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of in-context learning (ICL) in
large language models by reconciling two dominant perspectives: the
component-level analysis of attention heads and the holistic decomposition of
ICL into Task Recognition (TR) and Task Learning (TL). We propose a novel
framework based on Task Subspace Logit Attribution (TSLA) to identify attention
heads specialized in TR and TL, and demonstrate their distinct yet
complementary roles. Through correlation analysis, ablation studies, and input
perturbations, we show that the identified TR and TL heads independently and
effectively capture the TR and TL components of ICL. Using steering experiments
with geometric analysis of hidden states, we reveal that TR heads promote task
recognition by aligning hidden states with the task subspace, while TL heads
rotate hidden states within the subspace toward the correct label to facilitate
prediction. We further show how previous findings on ICL mechanisms, including
induction heads and task vectors, can be reconciled with our
attention-head-level analysis of the TR-TL decomposition. Our framework thus
provides a unified and interpretable account of how large language models
execute ICL across diverse tasks and settings.

*Haolin Yang,Hakaze Cho,Kaize Ding,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces Learned Task Vectors (LTVs), which improve in-context learning results and provide insight into their mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing task vectors (TVs), which are extracted via cumbersome and opaque methods, and lack clarity on their influence on model computations.

Method: Proposed Learned Task Vectors (LTVs), directly trained for better accuracy and flexibility. Conducted systematic analysis to understand how TVs influence predictions and computation.

Result: LTVs outperform extracted TVs in accuracy and work effectively in diverse configurations. Mechanistic analysis shows that TVs influence predictions via attention-head OV circuits and that their propagation involves rotation and scaling.

Conclusion: LTVs are a practical, effective approach to in-context learning and provide insight into the mechanisms of task representation and computation in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform new tasks from in-context
demonstrations, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent work
suggests that these demonstrations are compressed into task vectors (TVs),
compact task representations that LLMs exploit for predictions. However, prior
studies typically extract TVs from model outputs or hidden states using
cumbersome and opaque methods, and they rarely elucidate the mechanisms by
which TVs influence computation. In this work, we address both limitations.
First, we propose directly training Learned Task Vectors (LTVs), which surpass
extracted TVs in accuracy and exhibit superior flexibility-acting effectively
at arbitrary layers, positions, and even with ICL prompts. Second, through
systematic analysis, we investigate the mechanistic role of TVs, showing that
at the low level they steer predictions primarily through attention-head OV
circuits, with a small subset of "key heads" most decisive. At a higher level,
we find that despite Transformer nonlinearities, TV propagation is largely
linear: early TVs are rotated toward task-relevant subspaces to improve logits
of relevant labels, while later TVs are predominantly scaled in magnitude.
Taken together, LTVs not only provide a practical approach for obtaining
effective TVs but also offer a principled lens into the mechanistic foundations
of ICL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAG-GUI, a lightweight vision-language model that relies on web tutorials at inference time, outperforming baseline models with strong generalization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of limited training data and complex tasks requiring long-tailed knowledge in GUI automation using vision-language models.

Method: RAG-GUI is first warm-started using supervised finetuning and is further refined via self-guided rejection sampling finetuning, leveraging web tutorials at inference time. This model-agnostic plug-in enhances any VLM-based agent.

Result: RAG-GUI outperformed baseline agents and other inference baselines by 2.6% to 13.3% across tasks and model sizes, showcasing its effectiveness and practicality.

Conclusion: RAG-GUI is a versatile, generalizable solution that improves VLM-based agents' real-world application capabilities with an easy-to-use plug-and-play design.

Abstract: GUI agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in
automating complex digital tasks. However, their effectiveness in real-world
applications is often limited by scarce training data and the inherent
complexity of these tasks, which frequently require long-tailed knowledge
covering rare, unseen scenarios. We propose RAG-GUI , a lightweight VLM that
leverages web tutorials at inference time. RAG-GUI is first warm-started via
supervised finetuning (SFT) and further refined through self-guided rejection
sampling finetuning (RSF). Designed to be model-agnostic, RAG-GUI functions as
a generic plug-in that enhances any VLM-based agent. Evaluated across three
distinct tasks, it consistently outperforms baseline agents and surpasses other
inference baselines by 2.6% to 13.3% across two model sizes, demonstrating
strong generalization and practical plug-and-play capabilities in real-world
scenarios.

*Zhimeng Luo,Lixin Wu,Adam Frisch,Daqing He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedIRT, an evaluation framework for LLMs in medical applications, leveraging Item Response Theory to provide nuanced insights beyond traditional accuracy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for reliable evaluation methods for LLMs in high-stakes medical domains, as traditional accuracy metrics are insufficient.

Method: MedIRT employs Item Response Theory, gathering responses from 80 LLMs on a USMLE-aligned benchmark to assess latent model ability, question difficulty, and discrimination across topics.

Result: MedIRT offers stable rankings, identifies specialized abilities, and highlights that high overall rankings can be misleading. GPT-5 performs best overall but is outperformed in specific domains, showcasing nuanced insights.

Conclusion: MedIRT sets a psychometrically robust standard for LLM evaluation in healthcare, enhancing trustworthiness and utility through detailed competency profiling.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for high-stakes
medical applications, there has emerged a critical need for reliable and
accurate evaluation methodologies. Traditional accuracy metrics fail
inadequately as they neither capture question characteristics nor offer
topic-specific insights. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{MedIRT}, a
rigorous evaluation framework grounded in Item Response Theory (IRT), the gold
standard in high-stakes educational testing. Unlike previous research relying
on archival data, we prospectively gathered fresh responses from 80 diverse
LLMs on a balanced, 1,100-question USMLE-aligned benchmark. Using one
unidimensional two-parameter logistic IRT model per topic, we estimate LLM's
latent model ability jointly with question difficulty and discrimination,
yielding more stable and nuanced performance rankings than accuracy alone.
Notably, we identify distinctive ``spiky'' ability profiles, where overall
rankings can be misleading due to highly specialized model abilities. While
\texttt{GPT-5} was the top performer in a majority of domains (8 of 11), it was
outperformed in Social Science and Communication by \texttt{Claude-3-opus},
demonstrating that even an overall 23rd-ranked model can hold the top spot for
specific competencies. Furthermore, we demonstrate IRT's utility in auditing
benchmarks by identifying flawed questions. We synthesize these findings into a
practical decision-support framework that integrates our multi-factor
competency profiles with operational metrics. This work establishes a robust,
psychometrically grounded methodology essential for the safe, effective, and
trustworthy deployment of LLMs in healthcare.

*Luyang Zhang,Siyuan Peng,Jialu Wang,Shichao Zhu,Beibei Li,Zhongcun Wang,Guangmou Pan,Yan Li,Song Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PET, a framework for tracking dynamic user preferences using LLMs. PET enhances personalization transparency and addresses limitations of existing methods, significantly improving accuracy and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current LLM-based models for predicting user actions, while effective for short-term tasks, suffer from limitations such as lack of transparency, poor holistic user profiling, and popularity bias.

Method: The proposed Preference Evolution Tracking (PET) framework uses logit-probing and generative classification to model user preferences dynamically as probabilities over interpretable clusters.

Result: PET achieved up to 40% improvement in NDCG on public datasets like Yelp and MovieLens and substantially outperformed state-of-the-art baseline models in ranking long-tail content on a real-world short-video dataset.

Conclusion: PET offers a more transparent and interpretable framework for dynamic user preference modeling, addressing issues like opacity and bias in existing systems, while increasing explainability, fairness, and content diversity in recommendations.

Abstract: Understanding how user preference evolves over time is a fundamental
challenge central to modern digital ecosystems, for which Large Language Models
(LLMs) are an increasingly prominent and popular approach due to their ability
to comprehend the rich semantic context within behavioral data. A common
practice is to use LLMs to predict a user's next action by directly generating
a ranked list of preferred items. Although effective for short-term prediction,
the end-to-end generation paradigm inherently limits personalization. Its
opaque decision-making process obscures holistic user profiling and exacerbates
popularity bias. To address these limitations, we propose Preference Evolution
Tracking (PET), a framework that reframes the task as inferring a dynamic
probability distribution over a stable and interpretable lattice of preference
clusters. By applying logit-probing and generative classification techniques,
PET infers a user's preference as a probability distribution, enabling
transparent preference learning. On public benchmarks (Yelp, MovieLens), PET
improves ranking quality by up to 40% in NDCG over direct generation baselines.
On a large-scale, real-world dataset from a short-video platform, it excels at
ranking long-tail contents, significantly outperforming a SOTA production model
by 7 times in the NDCG score. Ultimately, PET transforms the user profile model
from direct preference list generation to a transparent distributional
preference mapping, paving the way for more explainable, fair, and diverse
personalization systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AceSearcher introduces a self-play framework that alternates between query decomposition and answer solving roles to improve reasoning-intensive tasks for search-augmented LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current search-augmented LLMs in multi-hop retrieval and reasoning for complex tasks.

Method: AceSearcher uses a cooperative self-play strategy, training an LLM to alternate between decomposing queries and generating answers. It combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement fine-tuning without intermediate annotations.

Result: AceSearcher achieves state-of-the-art performance in reasoning tasks, showing a 7.6% improvement on average exact match. It matches or surpasses significantly larger models in efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: AceSearcher demonstrates that a strategically trained LLM, even with fewer parameters, can outperform much larger search-augmented models on complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Search-augmented LLMs often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to
ineffective multi-hop retrieval and limited reasoning ability. We propose
AceSearcher, a cooperative self-play framework that trains a single large
language model (LLM) to alternate between two roles: a decomposer that breaks
down complex queries and a solver that integrates retrieved contexts for answer
generation. AceSearcher couples supervised fine-tuning on a diverse mixture of
search, reasoning, and decomposition tasks with reinforcement fine-tuning
optimized for final answer accuracy, eliminating the need for intermediate
annotations. Extensive experiments on three reasoning-intensive tasks across 10
datasets show that AceSearcher outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving an average exact match improvement of 7.6%. Remarkably, on
document-level finance reasoning tasks, AceSearcher-32B matches the performance
of the DeepSeek-V3 model using less than 5% of its parameters. Even at smaller
scales (1.5B and 8B), AceSearcher often surpasses existing search-augmented
LLMs with up to 9x more parameters, highlighting its exceptional efficiency and
effectiveness in tackling complex reasoning tasks. Our code will be published

TL;DR: The paper explores linguistic confidence (LC) as a lightweight, human-centered way to enhance confidence estimation in large language models (LLMs), offering tools and methods to improve reliability and usability in high-stakes settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of unreliable confidence estimation in LLMs used in high-stakes scenarios, which can mislead users and reduce task accuracy.

Method: (1) Released a large-scale dataset of hedging expressions with human-annotated confidence scores; (2) Proposed a mapper to convert hedges into confidence scores; (3) Conducted systematic experiments on LC in modern LLMs; (4) Introduced fine-tuning methods to improve LC reliability.

Result: Found that most LLMs underperform in linguistic confidence reliability, but carefully crafted prompting and fine-tuning techniques significantly enhanced LC calibration and discriminability.

Conclusion: Linguistic confidence is a scalable and human-aligned method for improving LLM uncertainty estimation, and requires further exploration as a practical solution for critical applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where overconfident responses can mislead users. Reliable confidence estimation
has been shown to enhance trust and task accuracy. Yet existing methods face
practical barriers: logits are often hidden, multi-sampling is computationally
expensive, and verbalized numerical uncertainty (e.g., giving a 0-100 score)
deviates from natural communication. We revisit linguistic confidence (LC),
where models express uncertainty through hedging language (e.g., probably,
might), offering a lightweight and human-centered alternative. To advance this
direction, we (1) release the first diverse, large-scale dataset of hedging
expressions with human-annotated confidence scores, and (2) propose a
lightweight mapper that converts hedges into confidence scores at near-zero
cost. Building on these resources, we (3) conduct the first systematic study of
LC across modern LLMs and QA benchmarks, revealing that while most LLMs
underperform in expressing reliable LC, carefully designed prompting achieves
competitive calibration and discriminability. Finally, we (4) introduce a
fine-tuning framework that further improves LC reliability. Taken together, our
work positions linguistic confidence as a scalable, efficient, and
human-aligned approach to LLM uncertainty estimation, and calls for deeper
exploration of this promising yet underexplored direction.

TL;DR: Evaluating language models is increasingly challenging due to contamination issues in static benchmarks. BeyondBench introduces algorithmic problem generation for fair and fresh evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of static benchmarks that can be contaminated by training data, making it unclear if language models reason or recall.

Method: The paper proposed BeyondBench, a framework generating algorithmic tasks in real-time, covering 44 tasks with 117 variations across three difficulty levels.

Result: Evaluation of 101 language models reveals significant deficiencies in reasoning, especially as problem complexity increases, with performance dropping drastically without tool usage.

Conclusion: BeyondBench provides a rigorous and contamination-free evaluation method, revealing the reasoning challenges language models face, especially with harder tasks.

Abstract: Evaluating language models fairly is becoming harder as static benchmarks
available on the internet risk contamination by training data. This makes it
unclear whether models are truly reasoning or just recalling answers. In this
paper, we introduce BeyondBench, an evaluation framework that avoids this
problem by using algorithmic problem generation. Unlike traditional benchmarks
that risk contamination from internet-scale training data, BeyondBench creates
mathematically grounded problems on the fly, ensuring each test remains fresh
and uncontaminated. Our framework covers 44 algorithmic tasks with a total of
117 variations, grouped into three difficulty levels: the Easy Suite (29 tasks)
for basic arithmetic and statistics, the Medium Suite (5 tasks, 49 variations)
for sequence patterns and reasoning, and the Hard Suite (10 tasks, 68
variations) tackling NP-complete and constraint satisfaction problems. Each
task generates problems from a combinatorial space larger than 10^15 unique
instances, with solutions verified deterministically by mathematical proofs. We
evaluated 101 language models, including 85 open-source and 16 closed-source
models, spanning sizes from 0.5B to 141B parameters and multiple quantization
schemes. Our results show consistent reasoning deficiencies across model
families, with performance degrading sharply as problem complexity increases
from polynomial to exponential. In our Hard Suite evaluations, models such as
Gemini-2.5-pro, Llama-3.3-70B, and Qwen2.5-72B achieved average accuracies of
56.38%, 26.91%, and 33.60%, respectively. Moreover, we observe that performance
drops drastically without tool usage, with GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5-nano
showing a decline of 16.81%, 28.05%, and 47.59% accuracy on the hard suite. Our
leaderboard is publicly available at https://ctrl-gaurav.github.io/BeyondBench/

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ScenarioBench introduces a benchmark for evaluating compliance-focused Text-to-SQL and retrieval-augmented generation systems, emphasizing traceability and decision justification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive benchmarks linking system outputs to robust evidence in compliance contexts, ensuring decisions are grounded and audit-ready.

Method: ScenarioBench employs YAML scenarios containing gold-standard decisions, trace data, governing clauses, and canonical SQL for scoring decision accuracy, trace quality, retrieval, SQL correctness, explanation validity, and latency.

Result: The benchmark assesses systems for clause-level evidence grounding, explanation falsifiability, retrieval difficulty, and time budgets, with metrics like SDI and SDI-R for normalized scoring.

Conclusion: ScenarioBench enhances evaluation standards by emphasizing justification quality and trace compliance, pushing advancements in retrieval-augmented and Text-to-SQL systems for policy-grounded applications.

Abstract: ScenarioBench is a policy-grounded, trace-aware benchmark for evaluating
Text-to-SQL and retrieval-augmented generation in compliance contexts. Each
YAML scenario includes a no-peek gold-standard package with the expected
decision, a minimal witness trace, the governing clause set, and the canonical
SQL, enabling end-to-end scoring of both what a system decides and why. Systems
must justify outputs using clause IDs from the same policy canon, making
explanations falsifiable and audit-ready. The evaluator reports decision
accuracy, trace quality (completeness, correctness, order), retrieval
effectiveness, SQL correctness via result-set equivalence, policy coverage,
latency, and an explanation-hallucination rate. A normalized Scenario
Difficulty Index (SDI) and a budgeted variant (SDI-R) aggregate results while
accounting for retrieval difficulty and time. Compared with prior Text-to-SQL
or KILT/RAG benchmarks, ScenarioBench ties each decision to clause-level
evidence under strict grounding and no-peek rules, shifting gains toward
justification quality under explicit time budgets.

Motivation: To address challenges in analyzing human morals and values embedded in language using diverse frameworks and data.

Method: Developed MoVa, which includes labeled datasets, benchmarking results, an efficient LLM prompting strategy, and applications for psychological survey evaluation.

Result: The LLM prompting strategy outperformed fine-tuned models, and the proposed 'all@once' classification strategy was recommended for better results.

Conclusion: MoVa provides resources to improve understanding of human and machine communication and has implications for aligning machine behavior with human morals.

Abstract: Identifying human morals and values embedded in language is essential to
empirical studies of communication. However, researchers often face substantial
difficulty navigating the diversity of theoretical frameworks and data
available for their analysis. Here, we contribute MoVa, a well-documented suite
of resources for generalizable classification of human morals and values,
consisting of (1) 16 labeled datasets and benchmarking results from four
theoretically-grounded frameworks; (2) a lightweight LLM prompting strategy
that outperforms fine-tuned models across multiple domains and frameworks; and
(3) a new application that helps evaluate psychological surveys. In practice,
we specifically recommend a classification strategy, all@once, that scores all
related concepts simultaneously, resembling the well-known multi-label
classifier chain. The data and methods in MoVa can facilitate many fine-grained
interpretations of human and machine communication, with potential implications
for the alignment of machine behavior.

Abstract: This paper presents the opdainlp team's solution for the GPU track of the
CPDC 2025 challenge. The challenge consists of three tasks, aiming to build an
in-game conversational AI that adheres to character personas, aligns with the
game's worldview, and supports function calling. Considering both effectiveness

the tasks based on the datasets provided by the competition organizers. We
employed Qwen3-14B with LoRA fine-tuning and model fusion, and utilized a base
model integrated with multiple LoRA adapters during inference. Specifically, in
the competition, we used three distinct LoRA adapters to handle tool calling,
response generation with tool call results, and response generation without
tool call results, respectively. MultiLoRA inference was implemented using
vLLM. Our solution achieved the first place in Task 1 and Task 3, and the
second place in Task 2 of the GPU track.

TL;DR: This paper proposes MetaTuner, a framework that combines prompt optimization and fine-tuning to improve large language model (LLM) performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential synergy of prompt optimization and fine-tuning, which are traditionally studied in isolation.

Method: MetaTuner framework uses two neural networks—one for generating prompts and another for parameters—with a shared encoding layer, optimized through supervised regularization loss.

Result: Experiments on various benchmarks indicate that MetaTuner consistently outperforms baseline methods.

Conclusion: MetaTuner effectively combines prompt optimization and fine-tuning, demonstrating superior results and exploring the unexplored synergy between the two techniques.

Abstract: Prompt optimization and fine-tuning are two major approaches to improve the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). They enhance the capabilities of
LLMs from complementary perspectives: the former through explicit natural
language, and the latter through implicit parameter updates. However, prior
work has typically studied them in isolation, leaving their synergistic
potential largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we
introduce MetaTuner, a novel framework that jointly integrates prompt
optimization and fine-tuning for LLM training. Specifically, we introduce two
neural networks to generate prompts and parameters, respectively, while
allowing them to share a common bottom encoding layer to enable knowledge
sharing. By the guidance of the final supervised signals, our framework is
optimized to discover the optimal combinations between the prompts and
parameters. Given that prompt learning involves discrete optimization while
fine-tuning operates in a continuous parameter space, we design a supervised
regularization loss to train our framework effectively. Extensive experiments
across diverse benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms the
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of Visual RAG systems overlook systematic considerations of query difficulty and ambiguity, leading to gaps in understanding system performance.

Method: The authors propose MRAG-Suite, a diagnostic platform that incorporates various multimodal benchmarks and introduces difficulty-based and ambiguity-aware query filtering strategies and the MM-RAGChecker diagnostic tool.

Result: Their evaluation reveals significant accuracy declines in handling difficult and ambiguous queries, uncovering systemic hallucination issues in Visual RAG systems. MM-RAGChecker demonstrates effectiveness in identifying and diagnosing these problems.

Conclusion: Visual RAG systems can be improved by addressing query difficulty and ambiguity, with platforms like MRAG-Suite and tools like MM-RAGChecker offering valuable diagnostic insights for refinement.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Visual RAG) significantly advances
question answering by integrating visual and textual evidence. Yet, current

We propose MRAG-Suite, a diagnostic evaluation platform integrating diverse

difficulty-based and ambiguity-aware filtering strategies, alongside
MM-RAGChecker, a claim-level diagnostic tool. Our results demonstrate
substantial accuracy reductions under difficult and ambiguous queries,
highlighting prevalent hallucinations. MM-RAGChecker effectively diagnoses
these issues, guiding future improvements in Visual RAG systems.

*Gyuhyeon Seo,Jungwoo Yang,Junseong Pyo,Nalim Kim,Jonggeun Lee,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SimuHome, a smart home simulation platform using the Matter protocol, highlighting gaps in current language model agents in handling complex smart home tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for smart home agents capable of addressing latent intents, temporal dependencies, and device constraints motivated the research.

Method: SimuHome, a time-accelerated simulation environment using the Matter protocol, was developed alongside a benchmark of 600 episodes and evaluation of 11 agents.

Result: Agents evaluated in SimuHome struggled with complex tasks like temporal scheduling, with GPT-4.1 achieving just 54% success rate.

Conclusion: There is significant room for improvement in creating methods to enhance state verification and coordination in smart home systems.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents excel at multi-step, tool-augmented tasks.
However, smart homes introduce distinct challenges, requiring agents to handle
latent user intents, temporal dependencies, device constraints, scheduling, and
more. The main bottlenecks for developing smart home agents with such
capabilities include the lack of a realistic simulation environment where
agents can interact with devices and observe the results, as well as a
challenging benchmark to evaluate them. To address this, we introduce
$\textbf{SimuHome}$, a time-accelerated home environment that simulates smart
devices, supports API calls, and reflects changes in environmental variables.
By building the simulator on the Matter protocol (the global industry standard
for smart home communication), SimuHome provides a high-fidelity environment,
and agents validated in SimuHome can be deployed on real Matter-compliant
devices with minimal adaptation. We provide a challenging benchmark of 600
episodes across twelve user query types that require the aforementioned
capabilities. Our evaluation of 11 agents under a unified ReAct framework
reveals that while models perform well on simple tasks, they struggle with
latent intent inference, state verification, and especially temporal
scheduling. Even the top-performing model, GPT-4.1, reaches only 54% success
rate. These findings highlight a critical need for methods that can reliably
verify the current state via tools before acting and coordinate time-dependent
actions.

*Yu-Che Tsai,Kuan-Yu Chen,Yuan-Chi Li,Yuan-Hao Chen,Ching-Yu Tsai,Shou-De Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GIRCSE, a novel framework using generative iterative refinement for creating better sentence embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based embeddings often use a static approach, ignoring the generative potential of LLMs and their ability to capture latent and implicit semantics.

Method: GIRCSE uses autoregressive generation and an Iterative Contrastive Refinement (ICR) objective to produce high-quality embeddings through stepwise refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments show GIRCSE achieves superior performance on MTEB benchmark and instruction-following tasks, with test-time scaling improving embedding quality.

Conclusion: GIRCSE establishes a new paradigm in representation learning by leveraging the generative capacity of LLMs for iterative refinement.

Abstract: Existing large language model (LLM)-based embeddings typically adopt an
encoder-only paradigm, treating LLMs as static feature extractors and
overlooking their core generative strengths. We introduce GIRCSE (Generative
Iterative Refinement for Contrastive Sentence Embeddings), a novel framework
that leverages autoregressive generation to iteratively refine semantic
representations. By producing sequences of soft tokens optimized under
contrastive objective, GIRCSE captures latent concepts and implicit semantics
that encoder-only methods often miss. To guide this process, we propose an
Iterative Contrastive Refinement (ICR) objective that encourages each
refinement step to yield better representations. Extensive experiments show
that GIRCSE outperforms strong LLM-based embedding baselines on the MTEB
benchmark and instruction-following tasks. Moreover, GIRCSE exhibits an
emergent test-time scaling property: generating more tokens at inference
steadily improves embedding quality. Our results establish generative iterative
refinement as a new paradigm for representation learning.

*Xinyu Pi,Qisen Yang,Chuong Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LOGOS is a framework aimed at automating the grounded theory workflow, transforming text into structured theory and achieving high accuracy compared to experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grounded theory relies heavily on manual coding by experts, which poses a scalability issue. Existing computational tools fail to achieve full automation.

Method: LOGOS employs LLM-driven coding, semantic clustering, graph reasoning, and iterative refinement to automate the creation of hierarchical theories from text.

Result: LOGOS exhibits $88.2\%$ alignment with expert-developed schemas across five tests and outperforms existing baseline methods.

Conclusion: LOGOS makes qualitative research scalable and accessible without sacrificing theoretical depth or precision, offering a new approach to grounded theory.

Abstract: Grounded theory offers deep insights from qualitative data, but its reliance
on expert-intensive manual coding presents a major scalability bottleneck.
Current computational tools stop short of true automation, keeping researchers
firmly in the loop. We introduce LOGOS, a novel, end-to-end framework that
fully automates the grounded theory workflow, transforming raw text into a
structured, hierarchical theory. LOGOS integrates LLM-driven coding, semantic
clustering, graph reasoning, and a novel iterative refinement process to build
highly reusable codebooks. To ensure fair comparison, we also introduce a
principled 5-dimensional metric and a train-test split protocol for
standardized, unbiased evaluation. Across five diverse corpora, LOGOS
consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves a remarkable $88.2\%$
alignment with an expert-developed schema on a complex dataset. LOGOS
demonstrates a powerful new path to democratize and scale qualitative research
without sacrificing theoretical nuance.

*Zherui Li,Zheng Nie,Zhenhong Zhou,Yufei Guo,Yue Liu,Yitong Zhang,Yu Cheng,Qingsong Wen,Kun Wang,Jiaheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses vulnerabilities in Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) to jailbreak attacks, proposing a new defense framework called DiffuGuard, which significantly reduces attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze distinct vulnerabilities of Diffusion Large Language Models arising from their generation mechanisms and devise methods to enhance their safety and robustness against jailbreak attacks.

Method: The authors examine dLLM vulnerabilities through intra-step and inter-step dynamics, identify biases in standard decoding strategies, and propose a training-free framework, DiffuGuard, which includes Stochastic Annealing Remasking and Block-level Audit and Repair strategies.

Result: DiffuGuard reduces the Attack Success Rate from 47.9% to 14.7% across four dLLMs when tested against six different jailbreak methods.

Conclusion: DiffuGuard enhances the intrinsic safety of dLLMs by mitigating decoding vulnerabilities and demonstrates that dLLMs can maintain high utility and efficiency while improving robustness against attacks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) introduces
unprecedented vulnerabilities that are fundamentally distinct from
Autoregressive LLMs, stemming from their iterative and parallel generation
mechanisms. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of dLLM
vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks across two distinct dimensions: intra-step
and inter-step dynamics. Experimental results reveal a harmful bias inherent in
the standard greedy remasking strategy and identify a critical phenomenon we
term Denoising-path Dependence, where the safety of early-stage tokens
decisively influences the final output. These findings also indicate that while
current decoding strategies constitute a significant vulnerability, dLLMs
possess a substantial intrinsic safety potential. To unlock this potential, we
propose DiffuGuard, a training-free defense framework that addresses
vulnerabilities through a dual-stage approach: Stochastic Annealing Remasking
dynamically introduces controlled randomness to mitigate greedy selection bias,
while Block-level Audit and Repair exploits internal model representations for
autonomous risk detection and guided correction. Comprehensive experiments on
four dLLMs demonstrate DiffuGuard's exceptional effectiveness, reducing Attack
Success Rate against six diverse jailbreak methods from 47.9% to 14.7% while
preserving model utility and efficiency. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to transform Text-Only QA Pairs into Multi-Modal QA Pairs, evaluates the benchmarks, and offers a solution for refining outputs via an agentic system (Q-Mirror).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of multi-modal benchmarks is costly and unscalable, necessitating a systematic method to enhance scientific reasoning in large models.

Method: The authors propose a TQA-to-MMQA framework, construct evaluation benchmarks, and implement the Q-Mirror system for iterative refining of Multi-Modal QA Pairs.

Result: Experiments reveal that current models perform below expectations in MMQA generation. The Q-Mirror system significantly improves generated scores and pass rates.

Conclusion: Integrating generation and evaluation in a feedback loop enables practical and scalable creation of high-quality multi-modal benchmarks, aiding scientific advancement in model reasoning.

Abstract: High-quality, multi-modal benchmarks are crucial for advancing scientific
reasoning in large models yet their manual creation is costly and unscalable.
To address this bottleneck, we explore the potential for transforming Text-Only
QA Pairs (TQAs) into high-quality Multi-Modal QA Pairs (MMQAs), which include
three parts: 1) Task Definition \& Evaluation Rubric: We develop a TQA-to-MMQA
framework and establish a comprehensive, multi-dimensional MMQA quality rubric
that provides principles for the transformation. 2) Benchmark Construction:
Then we construct two extensive benchmarks to rigorously evaluate
state-of-the-art generation \& understanding models on the distinct tasks of
MMQA generation \& MMQA quality evaluation. 3) Preliminary Solution: We develop
an agentic system (Q-Mirror), which operationalizes our framework by
integrating MMQA generation and evaluation into a closed loop for iterative
refinement. Our experiments show that while state-of-the-art models can
generate MMQAs, their outputs still leave substantial gaps, underscoring the
need for reliable evaluation. We further demonstrate that top-tier
understanding models align closely with human judgment in MMQA quality
assessment. Leveraging both insights, the Q-Mirror agent raises average scores
from 78.90 to 85.22 and pass rates from 72\% to 95\%, offering a practical path
to large-scale scientific benchmarks.

### [274] [Dual Mechanisms of Value Expression: Intrinsic vs. Prompted Values in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24319)
*Jongwook Han,Jongwon Lim,Injin Kong,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies how Large Language Models (LLMs) express values through intrinsic (learned) and prompted (explicitly guided) means and uncovers partial overlap and unique features between these mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind value alignment and persona steering in LLMs, especially the interplay between intrinsic and prompted value expressions, which remains underexplored.

Method: The authors used 'value vectors' (feature directions from residual streams) and 'value neurons' (Specific neurons in MLP layers) to analyze LLMs' expression of values at a mechanistic level.

Result: Intrinsic and prompted value mechanisms share some critical components but also have unique aspects. Prompted mechanisms exhibit higher value steerability, while intrinsic mechanisms display greater lexical diversity.

Conclusion: Intrinsic and prompted mechanisms serve different yet complementary roles in steering value expressions in LLMs, with trade-offs in terms of steerability and response diversity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can express different values in two distinct
ways: (1) intrinsic expression, reflecting the model's inherent values learned
during training, and (2) prompted expression, elicited by explicit prompts.
Given their widespread use in value alignment and persona steering, it is
paramount to clearly understand their underlying mechanisms, particularly
whether they mostly overlap (as one might expect) or rely on substantially
different mechanisms, but this remains largely understudied. We analyze this at
the mechanistic level using two approaches: (1) value vectors, feature
directions representing value mechanisms extracted from the residual stream,
and (2) value neurons, MLP neurons that contribute to value expressions. We
demonstrate that intrinsic and prompted value mechanisms partly share common
components that are crucial for inducing value expression, but also possess
unique elements that manifest in different ways. As a result, these mechanisms
lead to different degrees of value steerability (prompted > intrinsic) and
response diversity (intrinsic > prompted). In particular, components unique to
the intrinsic mechanism seem to promote lexical diversity in responses, whereas
those specific to the prompted mechanism primarily strengthen instruction
following, taking effect even in distant tasks like jailbreaking.

*Yuntao Shou,Tao Meng,Wei Ai,Keqin Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive survey of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) focusing on their role in emotion recognition and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a systematic consolidation of recent advancements in LLMs and MLLMs for emotion recognition and reasoning, which has become a burgeoning field in AI for Science.

Method: The paper surveys LLMs and MLLMs by evaluating their architectures, datasets, and performance benchmarks, while also identifying key challenges and proposing future research directions.

Result: The paper successfully offers an authoritative reference with a detailed overview and practical insights into LLMs and MLLMs applied to emotion recognition and reasoning.

Conclusion: The study represents the first systematic attempt to review the intersection of MLLMs and multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning, paving the way for advancements in this area.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have driven major advances in
language understanding, marking a significant step toward artificial general
intelligence (AGI). With increasing demands for higher-level semantics and
cross-modal fusion, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged,
integrating diverse information sources (e.g., text, vision, and audio) to
enhance modeling and reasoning in complex scenarios. In AI for Science,
multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning has become a rapidly growing
frontier. While LLMs and MLLMs have achieved notable progress in this area, the
field still lacks a systematic review that consolidates recent developments. To
address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLMs and MLLMs
for emotion recognition and reasoning, covering model architectures, datasets,
and performance benchmarks. We further highlight key challenges and outline
future research directions, aiming to offer researchers both an authoritative
reference and practical insights for advancing this domain. To the best of our
knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to comprehensively survey the
intersection of MLLMs with multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning. The

### [276] [Speculative Verification: Exploiting Information Gain to Refine Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24328)
*Sungkyun Kim,Jaemin Kim,Dogyung Yoon,Jiho Shin,Junyeol Lee,Jiwon Seo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Low latency issues in LLMs are addressed by Speculative Verification (SV), an improvement over Speculative Decoding (SD), which uses a small auxiliary model for adaptive verification, significantly boosting computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) suffers from inefficiency and high latency, and while speculative decoding helps mitigate this, its effectiveness diminishes at large batch sizes due to overhead from rejected tokens.

Method: The authors propose Speculative Verification (SV), which features a companion model that predicts the alignment accuracy between draft and target models, allowing dynamic adaptation of verification lengths. This minimizes wasted computations and requires no modifications to the target or draft models.

Result: Speculative Verification consistently outperforms conventional Speculative Decoding and standard target-model decoding across multiple LLM configurations, achieving up to a 2x performance improvement and an average speedup of 1.4x in large-batch scenarios.

Conclusion: SV demonstrates scalability, flexibility, and practical utility for increasing the efficiency of LLM inference, making it a robust alternative to traditional decoding mechanisms.

Abstract: LLMs have low GPU efficiency and high latency due to autoregressive decoding.
Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this using a small draft model to
speculatively generate multiple tokens, which are then verified in parallel by
a target model. However, when speculation accuracy is low, the overhead from
rejected tokens can offset the benefits, limiting SD's effectiveness,
especially at large batch sizes. To address this, we propose Speculative
Verification (SV), an efficient augmentation to SD that dynamically predicts
speculation accuracy and adapts the verification length to maximize throughput.
SV introduces a companion model - a small auxiliary model similar in size to
the draft model - to estimate the alignment between draft and target model
distributions. By maximizing the information gain from quantifying this
alignment, SV refines verification decisions, reducing wasted computation on
rejected tokens and improving decoding efficiency. Moreover, SV requires no
modifications to the draft or target models and is compatible with existing SD
variants. We extensively evaluated SV on publicly available LLMs across three
NLP tasks using nine combinations of draft, companion, and target models,
including 13B-72B target models and three types of variations: base (no
finetuning), instruction-tuned, and task fine-tuned. Across all experiments and
batch sizes (4-80), SV consistently outperforms both SD and standard decoding
with the target model. It improves SD performance by up to 2$\times$, with an
average speedup of 1.4 $\times$ in large-batch settings (batch sizes 32-80).
These results demonstrate SV's robustness, scalability, and practical utility
for efficient LLM inference.

*Mengyu Bu,Shaolei Zhang,Zhongjun He,Hua Wu,Yang Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AlignX, a two-stage framework to enhance the multilingual performance of LLMs, focusing on better representation alignment and multilingual fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many multilingual LLMs perform suboptimally in non-dominant languages due to issues with alignment and knowledge transfer.

Method: AlignX enhances multilingual performance in two stages: (1) aligning multilingual representations via semantic alignment and language feature integration, and (2) using multilingual instruction fine-tuning to boost multilingual LLM capabilities.

Result: The experiments show that AlignX improves both general multilingual and cross-lingual generation performance in several pre-trained LLMs.

Conclusion: AlignX helps align multilingual representations closer, leading to better cross-lingual understanding and overall enhanced LLM multilingual capacity.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) possess impressive multilingual
understanding and generation capabilities. However, their performance and
cross-lingual alignment often lag for non-dominant languages. A common solution
is to fine-tune LLMs on large-scale and more balanced multilingual corpus, but
such approaches often lead to imprecise alignment and suboptimal knowledge
transfer, struggling with limited improvements across languages. In this paper,
we propose AlignX to bridge the multilingual performance gap, which is a
two-stage representation-level framework for enhancing multilingual performance
of pre-trained LLMs. In the first stage, we align multilingual representations
with multilingual semantic alignment and language feature integration. In the
second stage, we stimulate the multilingual capability of LLMs via multilingual
instruction fine-tuning. Experimental results on several pre-trained LLMs
demonstrate that our approach enhances LLMs' multilingual general and
cross-lingual generation capability. Further analysis indicates that AlignX
brings the multilingual representations closer and improves the cross-lingual
alignment.

*Matthew Theodore Roque,Dan John Velasco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates how curriculum learning and data simplification during language model pretraining affect performance, especially in data-constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most language model research emphasizes large datasets, leaving little exploration into optimization in low-data scenarios, specifically regarding text order and alternate text versions.

Method: The paper uses a pair of parallel corpora with human-written and simplified text, testing four curriculum schedules: repeated exposure, low-to-high complexity, high-to-low complexity, and interleaved ordering.

Result: Simplified data improves fine-tuning and zero-shot performance over the baseline; smaller models gain from low-to-high ordering, while larger models benefit from interleaved ordering.

Conclusion: Incorporating simplified texts and strategically ordering data enhances representation and model performance, offering tailored strategies for different model sizes.

Abstract: Most studies on language model pretraining focus on large datasets, leaving
open questions about optimization in data-constrained settings. In such
settings, the effects of training data order and of including alternative
versions of the same text remain underexplored. We address this by studying
curriculum learning in pretraining, focusing on text-complexity ordering and
data augmentation via simplification. We ask: (1) Does simplifying texts
enhance representation quality more than reusing the original data? and (2)
Does ordering data by text complexity yield better representations? To answer,
we build on a pair of parallel corpora where human-written paragraphs are
aligned with LLM-simplified variants, and test four data schedules: repeated
exposure, low-to-high complexity, high-to-low, and interleaved. We analyze
models' representation quality from a sample efficiency perspective via
fine-tuning, as well as its zero-shot performance on linguistic knowledge,
entity tracking, world knowledge, and commonsense reasoning. Our findings show
that adding simplified data improves fine-tuning and zero-shot performance over
a repeated-exposure baseline: smaller models benefit from low-to-high
complexity, while larger models perform better with interleaved ordering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces RMT, a reinforcement mid-training stage between pre-training and post-training, addressing inefficiencies and boosting model performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve large language model training by addressing inefficiencies during intermediate stages leading to stronger overall performance.

Method: This paper proposes RMT, which resolves challenges through a dynamic token budget mechanism, curriculum-based adaptive sampling, and a dual training strategy that combines reinforcement learning with next-token prediction.

Result: RMT achieves up to +64.91% performance improvement in language modeling with reduced reasoning length and boosts post-training performance by up to +18.76% in mathematical domains.

Conclusion: Incorporating reinforcement mid-training optimizes both intermediate and final model performance, marking it as a valuable addition to the training process of large language models.

Abstract: The development of state-of-the-art large language models is commonly
understood as a two-stage process involving pre-training and post-training. We
point out the need for an additional intermediate stage called reinforcement
mid-training with potential for strong performance gains. In this paper, we
formally define the problem and identify three key challenges: (1) inefficient
training due to excessive reasoning steps, (2) disregard of the imbalanced
token entropy distribution, and (3) underutilization of token information. To
address these challenges, we propose RMT, a framework for efficient, adaptive,
and unified reinforcement mid-training with various innovative components. In
particular, we first introduce a dynamic token budget mechanism that constrains
unnecessary reasoning steps and mitigates model overthinking. Next, we design a
curriculum-based adaptive sampling method that fosters a progressive learning
trajectory from easy to hard tokens. Finally, we present a dual training
strategy that combines reinforcement learning with next-token prediction,
ensuring targeted learning on key tokens and full exploitation of all token
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of RMT over
state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to +64.91% performance improvement with
only 21% of the reasoning length in language modeling. We also show that
checkpoints obtained after reinforcement mid-training can benefit the
subsequent post-training, yielding up to +18.76% improvement in the
mathematical domain.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HarmMetric Eval, a benchmark for assessing LLM harmfulness evaluation metrics and judges. Surprisingly, traditional metrics outperformed LLM-based judges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) by addressing weaknesses in assessing alignment with human values and harmfulness metrics.

Method: Develop a benchmark (HarmMetric Eval) comprising a dataset of harmful prompts and responses, along with scoring mechanisms adaptable to various evaluation methods.

Result: Experiments using HarmMetric Eval revealed traditional metrics (METEOR and ROUGE-1) outperform LLM-based judges in harmful response evaluation.

Conclusion: Conventional metrics remain effective for harmfulness evaluation in LLM outputs, challenging assumptions about the superiority of LLM-based methods.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical
for their safe deployment, yet jailbreak attacks can subvert this alignment to
elicit harmful outputs from LLMs. In recent years, a proliferation of jailbreak
attacks has emerged, accompanied by diverse metrics and judges to assess the
harmfulness of the LLM outputs. However, the absence of a systematic benchmark
to assess the quality and effectiveness of these metrics and judges undermines
the credibility of the reported jailbreak effectiveness and other risks. To
address this gap, we introduce HarmMetric Eval, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to support both overall and fine-grained evaluation of harmfulness
metrics and judges. Our benchmark includes a high-quality dataset of
representative harmful prompts paired with diverse harmful and non-harmful
model responses, alongside a flexible scoring mechanism compatible with various
metrics and judges. With HarmMetric Eval, our extensive experiments uncover a
surprising result: two conventional metrics--METEOR and ROUGE-1--outperform
LLM-based judges in evaluating the harmfulness of model responses, challenging
prevailing beliefs about LLMs' superiority in this domain. Our dataset is
publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/qusgo/HarmMetric_Eval,

TL;DR: A diffusion-based language model, LLaDA-MoE, introduces a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for efficient inference and achieves competitive performance compared to larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to reduce computational overhead in large language models while maintaining high performance, leveraging sparse activation with MoE architectures.

Method: The authors train a 7B parameter diffusion language model from scratch, activating only 1.4B parameters during inference using the Mixture-of-Experts architecture.

Result: LLaDA-MoE outperforms existing diffusion language models and demonstrates comparable capabilities to smaller instruct-tuned models across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: Sparse MoE architectures effectively enhance diffusion language models' efficiency without sacrificing task performance, paving the way for further exploration in this area.

Abstract: We introduce LLaDA-MoE, a large language diffusion model with the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, trained from scratch on approximately
20T tokens. LLaDA-MoE achieves competitive performance with significantly
reduced computational overhead by maintaining a 7B-parameter capacity while
activating only 1.4B parameters during inference. Our empirical evaluation
reveals that LLaDA-MoE achieves state-of-the-art performance among diffusion
language models with larger parameters, surpassing previous diffusion language
models LLaDA, LLaDA 1.5, and Dream across multiple benchmarks. The
instruct-tuned model LLaDA-MoE-7B-A1B-Instruct demonstrates capabilities
comparable to Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct in knowledge understanding, code generation,
mathematical reasoning, agent and alignment tasks, despite using fewer active
parameters. Our results show that integrating a sparse MoE architecture into
the training objective of masked diffusion language models still brings out
MoE's strengths under efficient inference with few active parameters, and opens
ample room for further exploration of diffusion language models. LLaDA-MoE
models are available at Huggingface.

TL;DR: Agentar-Scale-SQL is a novel framework achieving state-of-the-art results in Text-to-SQL tasks by utilizing a unique combination of scaling strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-SQL methods underperform compared to human experts on challenging benchmarks like BIRD due to the lack of orchestrated test-time scaling strategies and insufficient focus on internal reasoning.

Method: The paper introduces the Agentar-Scale-SQL framework, which uses an Orchestrated Test-Time Scaling strategy combining three approaches: RL-enhanced internal reasoning, iterative sequential refinement, and diverse synthesis with tournament selection.

Result: Agentar-Scale-SQL achieves 81.67% execution accuracy on the BIRD benchmark test set, attaining state-of-the-art performance and ranking first on the leaderboard.

Conclusion: Agentar-Scale-SQL offers a promising framework for narrowing the gap between machine and human-level performance in Text-to-SQL tasks while being adaptable to new databases and advanced language models.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Text-to-SQL methods still lag significantly behind
human experts on challenging benchmarks like BIRD. Current approaches that
explore test-time scaling lack an orchestrated strategy and neglect the model's
internal reasoning process. To bridge this gap, we introduce Agentar-Scale-SQL,
a novel framework leveraging scalable computation to improve performance.
Agentar-Scale-SQL implements an Orchestrated Test-Time Scaling strategy that
synergistically combines three distinct perspectives: i) Internal Scaling via
RL-enhanced Intrinsic Reasoning, ii) Sequential Scaling through Iterative
Refinement, and iii) Parallel Scaling using Diverse Synthesis and Tournament
Selection. Agentar-Scale-SQL is a general-purpose framework designed for easy
adaptation to new databases and more powerful language models. Extensive
experiments show that Agentar-Scale-SQL achieves SOTA performance on the BIRD
benchmark, reaching 81.67\% execution accuracy on the test set and ranking
first on the official leaderboard, demonstrating an effective path toward
human-level performance.

*Khanh Trinh Pham,Thu Huong Nguyen,Jun Jo,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen,Thanh Tam Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiSpider 2.0 is a multilingual extension of the Spider 2.0 benchmark for Text-to-SQL tasks, introducing new complexity while showing the weaknesses of current state-of-the-art methods in handling multiple languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the scarcity of multilingual benchmarks for Text-to-SQL systems to enable progress in creating robust language-independent models.

Method: They extend Spider 2.0 to eight languages, preserving structural difficulty while incorporating linguistic variability, and introduce a new baseline using collaboration-driven language agents for iterative query refinement.

Result: Current state-of-the-art models achieve only 4% execution accuracy on intrinsic reasoning compared to 60% on the prior version, while the proposed iterative method improves this to 15%, revealing a significant multilingual performance gap.

Conclusion: The results emphasize the need for robust multilingual methods in Text-to-SQL systems for broader, real-world applicability.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables natural access to databases, yet most benchmarks are
English-only, limiting multilingual progress. We introduce MultiSpider 2.0,
extending Spider 2.0 to eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish,
Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese). It preserves Spider 2.0's
structural difficulty while adding linguistic and dialectal variability,
demanding deeper reasoning for complex SQL. On this benchmark, state-of-the-art
LLMs (such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1) reach only 4\% execution accuracy when
relying on intrinsic reasoning, versus 60\% on MultiSpider 1.0. Therefore, we
provide a collaboration-driven language agents baseline that iteratively
refines queries, improving accuracy to 15\%. These results reveal a substantial
multilingual gap and motivate methods that are robust across languages and
ready for real-world enterprise deployment. Our benchmark is available at

### [284] [CDT: A Comprehensive Capability Framework for Large Language Models Across Cognition, Domain, and Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24422)
*Haosi Mo,Xinyu Ma,Xuebo Liu,Derek F. Wong,Yu Li,Jie Liu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Cognition-Domain-Task (CDT) framework to holistically evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) and improve dataset capability evaluation and selection. The proposed approach outperformed existing baselines in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for LLMs focus on isolated tasks and abilities, lacking a unified framework for a comprehensive evaluation to capture the full scope of LLM capabilities.

Method: The authors propose the CDT framework, which integrates the Cattell-Horn-Carroll cognitive theory to categorize LLM capabilities. The framework is applied to dataset capability evaluation and data selection.

Result: Experiments showed strong correlations between CDT metrics and model performance, along with improved benchmark scores (44.3 and 45.4) through enhanced data selection methods.

Conclusion: The CDT framework offers a practical and effective approach for evaluating and optimizing LLM capabilities, contributing to improved performance and streamlined dataset processes.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced
their capabilities, highlighting the need for comprehensive evaluation
frameworks that extend beyond task-specific benchmarks. However, existing
benchmarks often focus on isolated abilities, lacking a holistic framework for
assessing LLM capabilities. To address this gap, we propose the
Cognition-Domain-Task (CDT) framework, which comprehensively measures a model's
capabilities across three dimensions. We expand the scope of model capability
definitions at the cognitive level by incorporating the Cattell-Horn-Carroll
cognitive theory, refining the categorization of model capabilities. We apply
CDT in two directions: dataset capability evaluation and data selection.
Experiments show that our capability metrics correlate well with downstream
performance and can support effective dataset analysis and construction. The
experiments on data selection also show significant improvements in both
general and specific benchmarks, achieving scores of 44.3 and 45.4, with an
increase of 1.6 and 2.2 points over the baselines, respectively. These results
validate the effectiveness and practicality of CDT. Source code and models are
available at https://github.com/Alessa-mo/CDT.

### [285] [Alternatives To Next Token Prediction In Text Generation -- A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24435)
*Charlie Wyatt,Aditya Joshi,Flora Salim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper surveys alternatives to the Next Token Prediction (NTP) paradigm in Large Language Models (LLMs), offering a taxonomy of methods to address NTP's inherent limitations in efficiency and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models have achieved significant success with the NTP paradigm but face limitations like inefficiency, error accumulation, and poor planning, necessitating exploration of alternative methods.

Method: This survey categorizes emerging approaches into five types: Multi-Token Prediction, Plan-then-Generate, Latent Reasoning, Continuous Generation Approaches, and Non-Transformer Architectures.

Result: The paper synthesizes insights across various methods, proposing a taxonomy to systematically guide alternatives to the existing NTP framework.

Conclusion: The study advances the understanding of model limitations linked to token-based generation and inspires development of transformative NLP models by categorizing feasible alternatives.

Abstract: The paradigm of Next Token Prediction (NTP) has driven the unprecedented
success of Large Language Models (LLMs), but is also the source of their most
persistent weaknesses such as poor long-term planning, error accumulation, and
computational inefficiency. Acknowledging the growing interest in exploring
alternatives to NTP, the survey describes the emerging ecosystem of
alternatives to NTP. We categorise these approaches into five main families:
(1) Multi-Token Prediction, which targets a block of future tokens instead of a
single one; (2) Plan-then-Generate, where a global, high-level plan is created
upfront to guide token-level decoding; (3) Latent Reasoning, which shifts the
autoregressive process itself into a continuous latent space; (4) Continuous
Generation Approaches, which replace sequential generation with iterative,
parallel refinement through diffusion, flow matching, or energy-based methods;
and (5) Non-Transformer Architectures, which sidestep NTP through their
inherent model structure. By synthesizing insights across these methods, this
survey offers a taxonomy to guide research into models that address the known
limitations of token-level generation to develop new transformative models for
natural language processing.

### [286] [Bias Mitigation or Cultural Commonsense? Evaluating LLMs with a Japanese Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24468)
*Taisei Yamamoto,Ryoma Kumon,Danushka Bollegala,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers evaluate how debiasing large language models (LLMs) affects cultural commonsense using a Japanese benchmark, SOBACO. Results show that debiasing can significantly degrade cultural commonsense performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the overlooked impact of bias mitigation on cultural commonsense in LLMs, as bias mitigation's effects have mainly been assessed with unrelated tasks.

Method: Introduction of SOBACO benchmark designed to measure cultural commonsense and social biases in LLMs. Various LLMs were evaluated using SOBACO to assess performance changes after debiasing.

Result: Debiasing methods negatively impacted cultural commonsense evaluations, with accuracy deterioration reaching up to 75%.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for debiasing methods that consider trade-offs with cultural commonsense to improve both fairness and utility in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit social biases, prompting the development
of various debiasing methods. However, debiasing methods may degrade the
capabilities of LLMs. Previous research has evaluated the impact of bias
mitigation primarily through tasks measuring general language understanding,
which are often unrelated to social biases. In contrast, cultural commonsense
is closely related to social biases, as both are rooted in social norms and
values. The impact of bias mitigation on cultural commonsense in LLMs has not
been well investigated. Considering this gap, we propose SOBACO (SOcial BiAs
and Cultural cOmmonsense benchmark), a Japanese benchmark designed to evaluate
social biases and cultural commonsense in LLMs in a unified format. We evaluate
several LLMs on SOBACO to examine how debiasing methods affect cultural
commonsense in LLMs. Our results reveal that the debiasing methods degrade the
performance of the LLMs on the cultural commonsense task (up to 75% accuracy
deterioration). These results highlight the importance of developing debiasing
methods that consider the trade-off with cultural commonsense to improve
fairness and utility of LLMs.

### [287] [A Text-To-Text Alignment Algorithm for Better Evaluation of Modern Speech Recognition Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24478)
*Lasse Borgholt,Jakob Havtorn,Christian Igel,Lars Maaløe,Zheng-Hua Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Modern neural networks excel in speech recognition but fall short in capturing errors in rare terms. A new alignment algorithm improves the precision of error analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Errors in rare terms, named entities, and domain-specific vocabulary are obscured by aggregate metrics, which require finer-grained error analysis.

Method: The paper introduces an alignment algorithm combining dynamic programming with beam search scoring for precise alignment of errors.

Result: The proposed method outperforms traditional text alignment methods in accurately identifying individual errors.

Conclusion: The novel alignment algorithm enhances error analysis capabilities and is publicly available via PyPI for use.

Abstract: Modern neural networks have greatly improved performance across speech
recognition benchmarks. However, gains are often driven by frequent words with
limited semantic weight, which can obscure meaningful differences in word error
rate, the primary evaluation metric. Errors in rare terms, named entities, and
domain-specific vocabulary are more consequential, but remain hidden by
aggregate metrics. This highlights the need for finer-grained error analysis,
which depends on accurate alignment between reference and model transcripts.
However, conventional alignment methods are not designed for such precision. We
propose a novel alignment algorithm that couples dynamic programming with beam
search scoring. Compared to traditional text alignment methods, our approach
provides more accurate alignment of individual errors, enabling reliable error
analysis. The algorithm is made available via PyPI.

### [288] [Sanitize Your Responses: Mitigating Privacy Leakage in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24488)
*Wenjie Fu,Huandong Wang,Junyao Gao,Guoan Wan,Tao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Self-Sanitize, an LLM-based framework designed to mitigate harmful content generation through mechanisms inspired by cognitive psychology. This method works in real-time, avoiding latency issues and resource-intensive approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns over harmful content generation by large language models, despite advancements in safety alignment, necessitate robust real-time mitigation strategies.

Method: The authors propose a framework called Self-Sanitize, comprising a Self-Monitor module for token-level inspection and a Self-Repair module for instant correction, enabling real-time intervention without significant latency.

Result: Experiments on four LLMs and privacy leakage scenarios show that Self-Sanitize is effective at mitigating harmful content, providing superior performance and low resource overhead while preserving LLM utility.

Conclusion: Self-Sanitize is a practical solution that enhances the safety of LLMs during real-time streaming applications, addressing privacy-invasive content while maintaining operational efficiency.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success across a wide
range of applications, such as chatbots and code copilots, concerns surrounding
the generation of harmful content have come increasingly into focus. Despite
significant advances in aligning LLMs with safety and ethical standards,
adversarial prompts can still be crafted to elicit undesirable responses.
Existing mitigation strategies are predominantly based on post-hoc filtering,
which introduces substantial latency or computational overhead, and is
incompatible with token-level streaming generation. In this work, we introduce
Self-Sanitize, a novel LLM-driven mitigation framework inspired by cognitive
psychology, which emulates human self-monitor and self-repair behaviors during
conversations. Self-Sanitize comprises a lightweight Self-Monitor module that
continuously inspects high-level intentions within the LLM at the token level
via representation engineering, and a Self-Repair module that performs in-place
correction of harmful content without initiating separate review dialogues.
This design allows for real-time streaming monitoring and seamless repair, with
negligible impact on latency and resource utilization. Given that
privacy-invasive content has often been insufficiently focused in previous
studies, we perform extensive experiments on four LLMs across three privacy
leakage scenarios. The results demonstrate that Self-Sanitize achieves superior
mitigation performance with minimal overhead and without degrading the utility
of LLMs, offering a practical and robust solution for safer LLM deployments.

### [289] [GRPO-MA: Multi-Answer Generation in GRPO for Stable and Efficient Chain-of-Thought Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24494)
*Hongcheng Wang,Yinuo Huang,Sukai Wang,Guanghui Ren,Hao Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of GRPO in training CoT reasoning for LLMs and VLMs, proposing GRPO-MA, which uses multi-answer generation for improved optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of GRPO, such as gradient coupling, sparse rewards, and unstable advantage estimation, in training CoT reasoning in LLMs and VLMs.

Method: GRPO-MA introduces multi-answer generation for every thought process, theoretically reducing thought advantage variance and empirically minimizing gradient spikes.

Result: Experiments show GRPO-MA significantly improves performance and training efficiency across tasks like math, code, and multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: Using multiple answers per thought process is an effective way to enhance the robustness and performance of GRPO in CoT reasoning.

Abstract: Recent progress, such as DeepSeek-R1, has shown that the GRPO algorithm, a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach, can effectively train Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). In this paper, we analyze three challenges of GRPO: gradient coupling
between thoughts and answers, sparse reward signals caused by limited parallel
sampling, and unstable advantage estimation. To mitigate these challenges, we
propose GRPO-MA, a simple yet theoretically grounded method that leverages
multi-answer generation from each thought process, enabling more robust and
efficient optimization. Theoretically, we show that the variance of thought
advantage decreases as the number of answers per thought increases.
Empirically, our gradient analysis confirms this effect, showing that GRPO-MA
reduces gradient spikes compared to GRPO. Experiments on math, code, and
diverse multimodal tasks demonstrate that GRPO-MA substantially improves
performance and training efficiency. Our ablation studies further reveal that
increasing the number of answers per thought consistently enhances model
performance.

### [290] [Knowledge Editing with Subspace-Aware Key-Value Mappings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24502)
*Haewon Park,Sangwoo Kim,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method, SUIT, to perform efficient knowledge editing in language models by modifying specific critical subspaces, demonstrating improved knowledge preservation and edit efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current knowledge editing methods in language models cause significant perturbations due to unconstrained key and value vector modifications, necessitating a more focused and less disruptive approach.

Method: The proposed SUIT method identifies critical subspaces of features relevant to edits and modifies only these subspaces to minimize disturbances in the model.

Result: Empirical evaluations on LLaMA-3-8B, GPT-J-6B, and Qwen2.5-7B models reveal that SUIT significantly enhances knowledge preservation compared to strong baselines while maintaining high edit effectiveness.

Conclusion: SUIT effectively pinpoints and edits critical subspaces, achieving precise and less disruptive knowledge modifications in language models. The code and data will be publicly accessible.

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to efficiently correct factual errors in Language
Models (LMs). The popular locate-then-edit approach modifies an MLP layer by
finding an optimal mapping between its input vector (key) and output vector
(value) that leads to the expression of the edited knowledge. However, existing
methods without any constraints on the key and value vectors cause significant
perturbations to the edited model. To address this, we propose Subspace
Knowledge Edit (SUIT), a method that identifies and modifies only the subspace
of critical features relevant to the edit. Our empirical results on LLaMA-3-8B,
GPT-J-6B, and Qwen2.5-7B models show that SUIT dramatically improves knowledge
preservation over strong baselines while maintaining high edit efficacy. This
effectiveness confirms that SUIT successfully identifies the critical subspace
for the edit. Further analyses provide additional validation for our approach.
The source code and data will be released to the public upon publication of the
paper.

*Hamna,Gayatri Bhat,Sourabrata Mukherjee,Faisal Lalani,Evan Hadfield,Divya Siddarth,Kalika Bali,Sunayana Sitaram*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces "Samiksha," a community-driven evaluation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure culturally aware and inclusive benchmarking in critical domains such as healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for LLMs fail to address the culturally nuanced and real-life needs of specific communities, especially in critical areas like healthcare.

Method: The authors created "Samiksha," a scalable, community-driven benchmarking process developed in collaboration with community members and Civil Society Organizations to integrate culturally aware feedback.

Result: Samiksha was applied to the health domain in India, providing insights into multilingual LLM performance on nuanced community health queries and highlighting gaps in current LLM frameworks.

Conclusion: Samiksha demonstrates the importance of grounding LLM evaluations in the lived realities and cultural contexts of communities, paving the way for scalable and inclusive assessment methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically evaluated through general or
domain-specific benchmarks testing capabilities that often lack grounding in
the lived realities of end users. Critical domains such as healthcare require
evaluations that extend beyond artificial or simulated tasks to reflect the
everyday needs, cultural practices, and nuanced contexts of communities. We
propose Samiksha, a community-driven evaluation pipeline co-created with
civil-society organizations (CSOs) and community members. Our approach enables
scalable, automated benchmarking through a culturally aware, community-driven
pipeline in which community feedback informs what to evaluate, how the
benchmark is built, and how outputs are scored. We demonstrate this approach in
the health domain in India. Our analysis highlights how current multilingual
LLMs address nuanced community health queries, while also offering a scalable
pathway for contextually grounded and inclusive LLM evaluation.

### [292] [AdaThink-Med: Medical Adaptive Thinking with Uncertainty-Guided Length Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24560)
*Shaohao Rui,Kaitao Chen,Weijie Ma,Xiaosong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaThink-Med is an approach for medical large language models (LLMs) that dynamically adjusts reasoning lengths based on question difficulty, reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many medical LLMs use long reasoning chains regardless of input complexity, inflating computational costs. Adaptive thinking is important to address this challenge, but prior end-to-end methods were lacking.

Method: AdaThink-Med generates multiple candidate answers, assesses their correctness and uncertainty, and calibrates reasoning length using an uncertainty-guided module to balance performance and effort.

Result: On six medical QA benchmarks, AdaThink-Med reduced reasoning path lengths by up to 6.4x on average while minimally affecting performance.

Conclusion: AdaThink-Med enhances medical LLMs by adapting reasoning lengths dynamically, with distinct modes for simple and complex questions, showcasing potential for improved efficiency in real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in inference time scaling with extended long chain-of thought
have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of both general and
medical large language models (LLMs). However, these models tend to engage in
lengthy reasoning processes regardless of the difficulty of the input question,
leading to increased inference costs in real-world applications. Therefore,
enabling adaptive thinking where models think less for simpler questions and
think more for complex ones is critical for the effective use of medical LLMs
in practice. Despite its importance, there is a lack of end-to-end approaches
designed to enhance the adaptive thinking capabilities of medical LLMs while
providing a comprehensive examination of the trade-off between performance and
computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaThink-Med, the first
end-to-end framework designed to enhance adaptive thinking ability in medical
reasoning models with uncertainty-guided length calibration. AdaThink-Med first
generates multiple candidate outputs for each question, evaluates the
correctness and uncertainty of each candidate, and then estimates problem
difficulty via an uncertainty-guided length calibration module. For outputs
with low difficulty and correct answers, the framework penalizes longer
reasoning paths; whereas for those with high difficulty and incorrect answers,
it encourages extending the chain of thought to explore alternative solutions.
On six public medical QA benchmarks, AdaThink-Med achieves up to 6.4x length
reduction on average while retaining performance with only minimal degradation.
Intriguingly, we observe that AdaThink-Med spontaneously develops two distinct
reasoning modes, which we characterize as "non-thinking" and "thinking",
demonstrating the model's ability to suppress redundant reasoning processes
dynamically.

### [293] [Inducing Dyslexia in Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24597)
*Melika Honarmand,Ayati Sharma,Badr AlKhamissi,Johannes Mehrer,Martin Schrimpf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study leverages large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) to simulate dyslexia by identifying and perturbing visual-word-form-selective units. Results indicate selective impairments in reading tasks, mirroring human dyslexic characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dyslexia remains poorly understood due to the limitations of traditional behavioral and neuroimaging methods in testing causal mechanisms. The paper aims to create a computational framework for better understanding dyslexia using advanced models.

Method: The researchers used VLMs to identify units involved in word processing, then selectively ablated these units. They tested the model's performance on reading and cognitive tasks to simulate and analyze dyslexia-like impairments.

Result: Targeted ablation caused selective impairments in reading tasks without affecting general visual and language abilities, paralleling human dyslexics' phonological deficits while preserving orthographic processing.

Conclusion: The study effectively models key traits of dyslexia within a computational framework, facilitating exploration of underlying mechanisms and potential interventions for reading disorders.

Abstract: Dyslexia, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent reading
difficulties, is often linked to reduced activity of the visual word form area
in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex. Traditional approaches to studying
dyslexia, such as behavioral and neuroimaging methods, have provided valuable
insights but remain limited in their ability to test causal hypotheses about
the underlying mechanisms of reading impairments. In this study, we use
large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) to simulate dyslexia by functionally
identifying and perturbing artificial analogues of word processing. Using
stimuli from cognitive neuroscience, we identify visual-word-form-selective
units within VLMs and demonstrate that targeted ablation of these units, unlike
ablation of random units, leads to selective impairments in reading tasks while
general visual and language comprehension abilities remain intact. In
particular, the resulting model matches dyslexic humans' phonological deficits
without a significant change in orthographic processing. Taken together, our
modeling results replicate key characteristics of dyslexia and establish a
computational framework for investigating reading disorders.

*Gio Paik,Yongbeom Kim,Soungmin Lee,Sangmin Ahn,Chanwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces HiKE, a benchmark for evaluating multilingual ASR models on Korean-English code-switching challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code-switching (CS) is underexplored in multilingual ASR despite its prevalence in daily speech, especially for Korean-English scenarios.

Method: The authors present HiKE, an accessible framework containing high-quality CS datasets, hierarchical labeling schemes, and loanword annotations for systematic ASR evaluation.

Result: Experiments show that initial ASR models struggle with code-switching but improve significantly when fine-tuned with CS data using the HiKE benchmark.

Conclusion: HiKE serves as a universally accessible tool that promotes research and effective evaluation of ASR models on code-switching tasks.

Abstract: Despite advances in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR),
code-switching (CS), the mixing of languages within an utterance common in
daily speech, remains a severely underexplored challenge. In this paper, we
introduce HiKE: the Hierarchical Korean-English code-switching benchmark, the
first globally accessible evaluation framework for Korean-English CS, aiming to
provide a means for the precise evaluation of multilingual ASR models and to
foster research in the field. The proposed framework not only consists of
high-quality, natural CS data across various topics, but also provides
meticulous loanword labels and a hierarchical CS-level labeling scheme (word,
phrase, and sentence) that together enable a systematic evaluation of a model's
ability to handle each distinct level of code-switching. Through evaluations of
diverse multilingual ASR models and fine-tuning experiments, this paper
demonstrates that while most multilingual ASR models initially struggle with
CS-ASR, this capability can be enabled through fine-tuning with CS data. HiKE
will be available at https://github.com/ThetaOne-AI/HiKE.

*Bojan Batalo,Erica K. Shimomoto,Neil Millar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the task of detecting promotional language ('hype') used in scientific texts and evaluates humans and machine-learning-based approaches for identifying it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific writing increasingly employs promotional language ('hype'), undermining objectivity and trust in science.

Method: The authors created formalized guidelines for hype detection, annotated a segment of the NIH grant corpus, and used it to train and evaluate text classifiers and language models against human performance.

Result: Formal annotation methods improved human reliability, and machine learning models showed promising performance on the hype detection task.

Conclusion: This work establishes hype detection as a natural language processing problem, underscoring linguistic complexity and the importance of domain knowledge for accurate analysis.

Abstract: In science, promotional language ('hype') is increasing and can undermine
objective evaluation of evidence, impede research development, and erode trust
in science. In this paper, we introduce the task of automatic detection of
hype, which we define as hyperbolic or subjective language that authors use to
glamorize, promote, embellish, or exaggerate aspects of their research. We
propose formalized guidelines for identifying hype language and apply them to
annotate a portion of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant application
corpus. We then evaluate traditional text classifiers and language models on
this task, comparing their performance with a human baseline. Our experiments
show that formalizing annotation guidelines can help humans reliably annotate
candidate hype adjectives and that using our annotated dataset to train machine
learning models yields promising results. Our findings highlight the linguistic
complexity of the task, and the potential need for domain knowledge and
temporal awareness of the facts. While some linguistic works address hype
detection, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to approach it as a
natural language processing task.

*Weilin Zhao,Zihan Zhou,Zhou Su,Chaojun Xiao,Yuxuan Li,Yanghao Li,Yudi Zhang,Weilun Zhao,Zhen Li,Yuxiang Huang,Ao Sun,Xu Han,Zhiyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces InfLLM-V2, a sparse attention framework tackling computational challenges of long-sequence processing in Transformers, showing efficiency and high performance while being publicly available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational and memory bottlenecks of self-attention in Transformers for long-sequence processing, without disrupting the pretrain-on-short, finetune-on-long paradigm.

Method: The paper proposes InfLLM-V2, a dense-to-sparse switchable attention framework reusing dense parameters and transitioning seamlessly from short to long sequences, prioritizing efficiency with a practical implementation.

Result: InfLLM-V2 demonstrated being 4x faster than dense attention while retaining 98.1% performance in long-context understanding and 99.7% in chain-of-thought reasoning.

Conclusion: InfLLM-V2 facilitates efficient long-sequence processing, maintains performance, and offers an open-source model (MiniCPM4.1) for reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Long-sequence processing is a critical capability for modern large language
models. However, the self-attention mechanism in the standard Transformer
architecture faces severe computational and memory bottlenecks when processing
long sequences. While trainable sparse attention methods offer a promising
solution, existing approaches such as NSA introduce excessive extra parameters
and disrupt the conventional \textit{pretrain-on-short, finetune-on-long}
workflow, resulting in slow convergence and difficulty in acceleration. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce dense-sparse switchable attention
framework, termed as InfLLM-V2. InfLLM-V2 is a trainable sparse attention that
seamlessly adapts models from short to long sequences. Specifically, InfLLM-V2
reuses dense attention parameters through parameter-free architecture
modification, maintaining consistency between short and long sequence
processing. Additionally, InfLLM-V2 ensures computational efficiency across all
sequence lengths, by using dense attention for short inputs and smoothly
transitioning to sparse attention for long sequences. To achieve practical
acceleration, we further introduce an efficient implementation of InfLLM-V2
that significantly reduces the computational overhead. Our experiments on
long-context understanding and chain-of-thought reasoning demonstrate that
InfLLM-V2 is 4$\times$ faster than dense attention while retaining 98.1% and
99.7% of the performance, respectively. Based on the InfLLM-V2 framework, we
have trained and open-sourced MiniCPM4.1
(https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM4.1-8B), a hybrid reasoning model,
providing a reproducible implementation for the research community.

### [297] [Understanding the Dilemma of Unlearning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24675)
*Qingjie Zhang,Haoting Qian,Zhicong Huang,Cheng Hong,Minlie Huang,Ke Xu,Chao Zhang,Han Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the challenges of effectively unlearning knowledge in large language models (LLMs), revealing that current methods are stuck between being ineffective or overly destructive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of interpretability in unlearning methods for LLMs and to explore whether existing techniques effectively erase specific knowledge without introducing catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Proposed unPact, an interpretable framework utilizing prompt attribution and contribution tracking to quantify each prompt token's influence and assess the pre- and post-unlearning changes.

Result: Findings indicate that unlearning disrupts focus on keywords but does not truly erase knowledge, as it can often be recovered by emphasizing keywords in prompts. Additionally, indiscriminate penalization leads to catastrophic forgetting, harming general model performance.

Conclusion: Existing unlearning methods for LLMs either leave knowledge partially recoverable or cause severe degradation in general performance, highlighting the need for more reliable approaches.

Abstract: Unlearning seeks to remove specific knowledge from large language models
(LLMs), but its effectiveness remains contested. On one side, "forgotten"
knowledge can often be recovered through interventions such as light
fine-tuning; on the other side, unlearning may induce catastrophic forgetting
that degrades general capabilities. Despite active exploration of unlearning
methods, interpretability analyses of the mechanism are scarce due to the
difficulty of tracing knowledge in LLMs' complex architectures. We address this
gap by proposing unPact, an interpretable framework for unlearning via prompt
attribution and contribution tracking. Typically, it quantifies each prompt
token's influence on outputs, enabling pre- and post-unlearning comparisons to
reveal what changes. Across six mainstream unlearning methods, three LLMs, and
three benchmarks, we find that: (1) Unlearning appears to be effective by
disrupting focus on keywords in prompt; (2) Much of the knowledge is not truly
erased and can be recovered by simply emphasizing these keywords in prompts,
without modifying the model's weights; (3) Catastrophic forgetting arises from
indiscriminate penalization of all tokens. Taken together, our results suggest
an unlearning dilemma: existing methods tend either to be insufficient -
knowledge remains recoverable by keyword emphasis, or overly destructive -
general performance collapses due to catastrophic forgetting, still leaving a
gap to reliable unlearning.

*Leander Girrbach,Chi-Ping Su,Tankred Saanum,Richard Socher,Eric Schulz,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates issues with LLM-as-a-judge scores and introduces Latent Judges to improve reliability and granularity in scalar ratings for free-text responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address instability and calibration issues in Likert-scale scoring from LLM visualizations without references.

Method: They study typical Likert scoring in LLMs, introduce latent methods such as probability-weighted scores, verifier probabilities, and linear probes, and benchmark their performance.

Result: Latent methods outperform standard prompting, yielding higher pairwise accuracy and single-rating correlations, showcasing their utility in deterministic reference-free evaluation.

Conclusion: Latent Judges improve the reliability and granularity of LLM-as-a-judge scoring, aiding tasks like Best-of-N selection and distillation.

Abstract: How reliable are single-response LLM-as-a-judge ratings without references,
and can we obtain fine-grained, deterministic scores in this setting? We study
the common practice of asking a judge model to assign Likert-scale scores to
free-text responses and show two systematic issues: scores are unstable under
sampling and poorly calibrated, leading to compression near the top of the
scale and frequent ties. We then propose and evaluate Latent Judges, which
derive scalar ratings from internal model signals: (i) probability-weighted
scores over integer ratings, (ii) verifier-style probabilities of "yes", and
(iii) linear probes trained on model activations at the rating position. Across
a broad suite of pairwise and single-rating benchmarks, latent methods match or
surpass standard prompting, with consistent gains on pairwise accuracy and
listwise ranking relevant to Best-of-N selection. Probability-weighted scores
achieve the strongest single-rating correlations, while probes recover useful
signals when output logits are miscalibrated. These results indicate that
latent information provides deterministic and more discriminative signals for
reference-free evaluation, and can improve selection and training approaches
like Best-of-$N$, multi-teacher distillation, and routing.

### [299] [MemGen: Weaving Generative Latent Memory for Self-Evolving Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24704)
*Guibin Zhang,Muxin Fu,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemGen introduces a dynamic generative memory framework for LLM-powered agents, enabling a human-like integration of memory and reasoning. It improves agent performance significantly over existing methods and demonstrates emergent memory faculties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory paradigms for LLM-powered agents fail to replicate the dynamic and integrated nature of human memory and reasoning, leading to a gap in achieving more naturalistic cognition in AI systems.

Method: MemGen employs a dynamic generative memory framework with two key components: a memory trigger to monitor reasoning for memory invocation and a memory weaver to enrich reasoning by constructing machine-native latent memory tokens.

Result: MemGen outperforms leading external memory systems such as ExpeL, AWM, and GRPO across eight benchmarks, with improvements of up to 38.22% and strong cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: MemGen represents a step toward naturalistic machine cognition, as it not only enhances reasoning capabilities but also exhibits emergent, human-like memory faculties, paving the way for advanced cognitive AI systems.

Abstract: Agent memory shapes how Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents, akin to
the human brain, progressively refine themselves through environment
interactions. Existing paradigms remain constrained: parametric memory forcibly
adjusts model parameters, and retrieval-based memory externalizes experience
into structured databases, yet neither captures the fluid interweaving of
reasoning and memory that underlies human cognition. To address this gap, we
propose MemGen, a dynamic generative memory framework that equips agents with a
human-esque cognitive faculty. It consists of a \textit{memory trigger}, which
monitors the agent's reasoning state to decide explicit memory invocation, and
a \textit{memory weaver}, which takes the agent's current state as stimulus to
construct a latent token sequence as machine-native memory to enrich its
reasoning. In this way, MemGen enables agents to recall and augment latent
memory throughout reasoning, producing a tightly interwoven cycle of memory and
cognition. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks show that MemGen
surpasses leading external memory systems such as ExpeL and AWM by up to
$38.22\%$, exceeds GRPO by up to $13.44\%$, and exhibits strong cross-domain
generalization ability. More importantly, we find that without explicit
supervision, MemGen spontaneously evolves distinct human-like memory faculties,
including planning memory, procedural memory, and working memory, suggesting an
emergent trajectory toward more naturalistic forms of machine cognition.

### [300] [Socratic-Zero : Bootstrapping Reasoning via Data-Free Agent Co-evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24726)
*Shaobo Wang,Zhengbo Jiao,Zifan Zhang,Yilang Peng,Xu Ze,Boyu Yang,Wei Wang,Hu Wei,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Socratic-Zero, a framework that autonomously generates high-quality training data for language models using a co-evolution system of three agents (Teacher, Solver, Generator). The method significantly outperforms prior data synthesis techniques in mathematical reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses limitations in current reasoning task frameworks, which rely on massive, human-annotated datasets that are difficult to scale. Existing data synthesis methods struggle with inconsistent quality and fail to adapt to evolving model capabilities.

Method: The Socratic-Zero framework employs three agents working in a closed-loop system. The Solver refines its reasoning using feedback, the Teacher generates adaptive challenges targeting the Solver’s weaknesses, and the Generator distills strategies for creating scalable, high-fidelity curricula. Only minimal seed data is required for this system to function.

Result: Starting from just 100 seed questions, Socratic-Solver-8B demonstrates an average improvement of +20.2 percentage points over prior methods across seven reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, synthetic data generated enables some student LLMs to surpass state-of-the-art commercial models.

Conclusion: Socratic-Zero represents a significant advancement in autonomous data synthesis for reasoning tasks, enabling scalable, high-quality training with minimal initial input and achieving remarkable performance gains in both custom and commercial LLMs.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks rely
heavily on massive, high-quality datasets-typically human-annotated and thus
difficult to scale. While data synthesis or distillation offers a promising
alternative, existing methods struggle with inconsistent data quality and an
inability to dynamically adapt to the evolving capabilities of the model,
leading to suboptimal training signals. To address these limitations, we
introduce Socratic-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
high-quality training data from minimal seed examples through the co-evolution
of three agents: the Teacher, the Solver, and the Generator. The Solver
continuously refines its reasoning by learning from preference feedback on both
successful and failed trajectories; the Teacher adaptively crafts increasingly
challenging questions based on the Solver's weaknesses; and the Generator
distills the Teacher's question-design strategy to enable scalable,
high-fidelity curriculum generation. This closed-loop system produces a
self-improving curriculum-requiring no pre-existing tasks or labels.
Remarkably, starting from only 100 seed questions, our Socratic-Solver-8B
achieves an average gain of +20.2 percentage points over prior data synthesis
methods across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AMC23, AIME24-25,
Olympiad, MATH-500, Minerva, and GSM8K), with consistent gains on both Qwen3
and GLM4 series models. Even more surprisingly, synthetic data from
Socratic-Generator-32B enables student LLMs to achieve superior performance
compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) commercial LLMs on these benchmarks,
including Qwen3-235B-A22B, DeepSeek-V3.1-671B, GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Grok-4,
and Claude-4.1-Opus.

### [301] [ProxyAttn: Guided Sparse Attention via Representative Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24745)
*Yixuan Wang,Huang He,Siqi Bao,Hua Wu,Haifeng Wang,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes ProxyAttn, a training-free algorithm to enhance efficiency in sparse attention for long text processing in Large Language Models (LLMs), solving performance degradation issues under high sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve efficiency and accuracy of attention mechanisms in LLMs, particularly for long texts, while mitigating the quadratic complexity inherent to such systems.

Method: ProxyAttn compresses attention head dimensions, uses pooled representative head scores to approximate scores for all heads, and introduces block-aware dynamic budget estimation for finer-grained importance evaluation.

Result: ProxyAttn achieves up to 10.3x acceleration in attention and 2.4x in prefilling tasks without significant degradation in performance. Experiments verify similarity among attention heads and fine-grained estimation efficiency.

Conclusion: ProxyAttn significantly improves performance and computational efficiency for LLMs in long-text tasks, establishing a more effective sparse attention mechanism compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms limits the efficiency of
Large Language Models (LLMs) on long-text tasks. Recently, methods that
dynamically estimate block importance have enabled efficient block sparse
attention, leading to significant acceleration in long-text pre-filling of
LLMs. However, their coarse-grained estimation inevitably leads to performance
degradation at high sparsity rates. In this work, we propose ProxyAttn, a
training-free sparse attention algorithm that achieves more precise block
estimation by compressing the dimension of attention heads. Based on our
observation of the similarity among multiple attention heads, we use the scores
of pooled representative heads to approximate the scores for all heads. To
account for the varying sparsity among heads, we also propose a block-aware
dynamic budget estimation method. By combining the scores from representative
proxy heads with multi-head dynamic budgets, we achieve a more fine-grained
block importance evaluation at low computational cost. Experiments on a variety
of mainstream models and extensive benchmarks confirm the underlying similarity
among attention heads. Leveraging a fine-grained estimation, the proposed
method achieves substantial gains in performance and efficiency compared to
existing methods. More precisely, ProxyAttn can achieve up to 10.3x attention
acceleration and 2.4x prefilling acceleration without significant performance
loss. Our code is available at https://github.com/wyxstriker/ProxyAttn.

### [302] [LatentEvolve: Self-Evolving Test-Time Scaling in Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24771)
*Guibin Zhang,Fanci Meng,Guancheng Wan,Zherui Li,Kun Wang,Zhenfei Yin,Lei Bai,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LatentEvolve is a new framework enhancing LLM reasoning by mimicking human cognitive processes, showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTS methods for LLMs do not facilitate progressive learning on scaling computations during inference, limiting their performance.

Method: The proposed LatentEvolve framework uses a two-part self-evolving system inspired by the Complementary Learning System theory: "daytime scaling" for rapid learning and retrieval, and "nighttime scaling" for integration and optimization. These processes mimic human cognitive dynamics.

Result: LatentEvolve achieved up to a 13.33% improvement over existing TTS methods like LatentSeek and TTRL, demonstrating strong performance across multiple benchmarks and model backbones.

Conclusion: LatentEvolve enables LLMs to progressively learn how to scale computations effectively, advancing the reasoning capabilities and generalization potential of TTS methods.

Abstract: Test-time Scaling (TTS) has been demonstrated to significantly enhance the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) during the inference
phase without altering model parameters. However, existing TTS methods are
largely independent, implying that LLMs have not yet evolved to progressively
learn how to scale more effectively. With the objective of evolving LLMs to
learn ``how to scale test-time computation,'' we propose LatentEvolve, a
self-evolving latent TTS framework inspired by the complementary learning
system (CLS) theory. Analogous to the human brain's dual system of a
fast-recall hippocampus and a slow-consolidating neocortex, LatentEvolve
comprises two evolutionary components: \textit{daytime scaling}, which rapidly
retrieves historical latent representations to better guide current LLM
reasoning; and \textit{nighttime scaling}, which integrates past latent
optimizations in a manner akin to the human brain's consolidation of
experiences during sleep. The alternation of daytime and nighttime processes
facilitates a fast and slow evolution of LLM TTS, mirroring human cognitive
dynamics in a fully unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments across eight
benchmarks and five model backbones demonstrate that our LatentEvolve surpasses
state-of-the-art TTS methods such as LatentSeek and TTRL by up to $13.33\%$ and
exhibits exceptional cross-domain and cross-backbone generalization.

*Jun Rao,Yunjie Liao,Xuebo Liu,Zepeng Lin,Lian Lian,Dong Jin,Shengjun Cheng,Jun Yu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SeaPO, a method that strategically amplifies errors during preference optimization for large language models (LLMs) to improve their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment methods face challenges due to the diminishing distinction between positive and negative samples during training, complicating preference learning.

Method: SeaPO amplifies three common LLM error types to ensure clearer distinctions between positive and negative samples, followed by preference-based training to address these errors.

Result: Evaluations across five capability dimensions and model scales show significant performance improvements, especially in truthfulness (5-10 percentage points).

Conclusion: SeaPO effectively improves LLM capabilities by leveraging error amplification, yielding both targeted and broad performance enhancements based on the error types introduced.

Abstract: Existing alignment methods for preference optimization of large language
models (LLMs) aim to enhance model performance by utilizing pairs of positive
and negative samples. However, due to the limited capacity of models in scoring
or generating responses, the quality of positive and negative samples may
become similar during training, which complicates optimization for preference
learning. To address this issue, we introduce SeaPO, a Strategic Error
Amplification method that leverages three error types commonly occurring in
LLMs to introduce specific error patterns into the model Preference
Optimization. This strategy ensures that negative samples are more erroneous
than positive samples and preference-based training is employed to mitigate the
occurrence of these errors, thereby enhancing model performance. Evaluations
across five capability dimensions and different model scales (1.5B to 14B)
demonstrate that the generated data significantly improved overall model
performance, particularly in terms of truthfulness, with improvements of 5-10
percentage points observed. Further analysis reveals that task performance
varies depending on the error types introduced. Injecting the most common error
types improves performance in related tasks, while a mix of error types leads
to a broader performance enhancement: most tasks show stable improvements,
while a few tasks exhibit significant gains.

*Luisa Geiger,Mareike Hartmann,Michael Sullivan,Alexander Koller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a tree-based evaluation metric for LLM-generated assembly instructions, focusing on spatiotemporal accuracy rather than textual similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation metrics such as BLEU and BERT scores fail to capture spatiotemporal aspects critical to the accuracy of step-by-step assembly instructions.

Method: The authors developed a tree-based metric designed to evaluate LLM-generated sewing instructions by reflecting on their spatiotemporal properties.

Result: The proposed metric shows better correlation with human annotations and quality ratings, outperforming traditional evaluation metrics like BLEU and BERT.

Conclusion: The metric proves superior in assessing spatiotemporal soundness and robustness, particularly against counterfactual examples designed to mislead traditional textual similarity-based evaluations.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel, automatic tree-based evaluation metric for
LLM-generated step-by-step assembly instructions, that more accurately reflects
spatiotemporal aspects of construction than traditional metrics such as BLEU
and BERT similarity scores. We apply our proposed metric to the domain of
sewing instructions, and show that our metric better correlates with
manually-annotated error counts as well as human quality ratings, demonstrating
our metric's superiority for evaluating the spatiotemporal soundness of sewing
instructions. Further experiments show that our metric is more robust than
traditional approaches against artificially-constructed counterfactual examples
that are specifically constructed to confound metrics that rely on textual
similarity.

*Xilin Dang,Kexin Chen,Xiaorui Su,Ayush Noori,Iñaki Arango,Lucas Vittor,Xinyi Long,Yuyang Du,Marinka Zitnik,Pheng Ann Heng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses LLMs' limitation in handling medical abstentions using KnowGuard, which integrates knowledge graph exploration to improve accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physicians need reliable systems for safe decision-making that reflect abstention behaviors when data is insufficient. Current LLMs fail at this due to insufficient strategies for identifying knowledge boundaries.

Method: KnowGuard introduces a two-stage methodology: evidence discovery through graph exploration and retrieval, followed by evaluation for ranking contextual medical evidence.

Result: KnowGuard enhances diagnostic accuracy by 3.93% and reduces interaction by 7.27 turns, outperforming state-of-the-art medical abstention systems.

Conclusion: KnowGuard demonstrates improved safety and efficiency in clinical decision-making by addressing LLM shortcomings in abstentions, making it valuable for realistic diagnostics scenarios.

Abstract: In clinical practice, physicians refrain from making decisions when patient
information is insufficient. This behavior, known as abstention, is a critical
safety mechanism preventing potentially harmful misdiagnoses. Recent
investigations have reported the application of large language models (LLMs) in
medical scenarios. However, existing LLMs struggle with the abstentions,
frequently providing overconfident responses despite incomplete information.
This limitation stems from conventional abstention methods relying solely on
model self-assessments, which lack systematic strategies to identify knowledge
boundaries with external medical evidences. To address this, we propose
\textbf{KnowGuard}, a novel \textit{investigate-before-abstain} paradigm that
integrates systematic knowledge graph exploration for clinical decision-making.
Our approach consists of two key stages operating on a shared contextualized
evidence pool: 1) an evidence discovery stage that systematically explores the
medical knowledge space through graph expansion and direct retrieval, and 2) an
evidence evaluation stage that ranks evidence using multiple factors to adapt
exploration based on patient context and conversation history. This two-stage
approach enables systematic knowledge graph exploration, allowing models to
trace structured reasoning paths and recognize insufficient medical evidence.
We evaluate our abstention approach using open-ended multi-round clinical
benchmarks that mimic realistic diagnostic scenarios, assessing abstention
quality through accuracy-efficiency trade-offs beyond existing closed-form
evaluations. Experimental evidences clearly demonstrate that KnowGuard
outperforms state-of-the-art abstention approaches, improving diagnostic
accuracy by 3.93\% while reducing unnecessary interaction by 7.27 turns on
average.

*Rui Jia,Yuang Wei,Ruijia Li,Yuang-Hao Jiang,Xinyu Xie,Yaomin Shen,Min Zhang,Bo Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiaCDM, a model specifically tailored for adapting cognitive diagnosis to dynamic and unstructured real-world teacher-student dialogues, improving diagnostic accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cognitive diagnosis models struggle to handle dynamic, lengthy, and unstructured real-world teacher-student dialogues, necessitating new methods for better diagnostic accuracy and interpretation.

Method: The paper modifies the initiation-response-evaluation (IRE) framework for dialogue-specific diagnostic frameworks and develops a graph-based encoding method to connect teacher questions with relevant knowledge components for key information extraction.

Result: Experiments on three real-world dialogue datasets show DiaCDM's superior diagnostic accuracy and better result interpretability compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DiaCDM effectively extends cognitive diagnosis to dialogue settings, providing teachers with an innovative tool for assessing students' cognitive states, marking the first model dedicated to this purpose.

Abstract: While cognitive diagnosis (CD) effectively assesses students' knowledge
mastery from structured test data, applying it to real-world teacher-student
dialogues presents two fundamental challenges. Traditional CD models lack a
suitable framework for handling dynamic, unstructured dialogues, and it's
difficult to accurately extract diagnostic semantics from lengthy dialogues. To
overcome these hurdles, we propose DiaCDM, an innovative model. We've adapted
the initiation-response-evaluation (IRE) framework from educational theory to
design a diagnostic framework tailored for dialogue. We also developed a unique
graph-based encoding method that integrates teacher questions with relevant
knowledge components to capture key information more precisely. To our
knowledge, this is the first exploration of cognitive diagnosis in a dialogue
setting. Experiments on three real-world dialogue datasets confirm that DiaCDM
not only significantly improves diagnostic accuracy but also enhances the
results' interpretability, providing teachers with a powerful tool for
assessing students' cognitive states. The code is available at

### [307] [SemShareKV: Efficient KVCache Sharing for Semantically Similar Prompts via Token-Level LSH Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24832)
*Xinye Zhao,Spyridon Mastorakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemShareKV is introduced as an innovative framework to enable semantic-aware cache sharing in large language models, addressing inefficiency in memory-heavy inference scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to reducing KV caches focus on exact matches or shared segments, limiting their applicability in semantically similar prompts that appear lexically different.

Method: SemShareKV employs fuzzy token matching using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), combined with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) for better positional preservation, to reuse caches in semantically similar prompts.

Result: Experiments showed up to a 6.25× speedup and 42% lower GPU memory usage with 5k tokens input, while maintaining output quality.

Conclusion: Semantic-aware cache sharing is a feasible and impactful strategy to enhance LLM inference efficiency and alleviate memory bottlenecks during inference.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, the memory footprint of
key-value (KV) caches during inference has become a significant bottleneck.
Existing approaches primarily focus on compressing KV caches within a single
prompt or reusing shared prefixes or frequently ocurred text segments across
prompts. However, such strategies are limited in scenarios where prompts are
semantically similar but lexically different, which frequently occurs in tasks
such as multi-document summarization and conversational agents. We propose
\textit{SemShareKV}, a KV cache sharing and compression framework that
accelerates LLM inference by reusing KVCache in semantically similar prompts.
Instead of relying on exact token matches, SemShareKV applies fuzzy token
matching using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) on token embeddings and
incorporates Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to better preserve positional
information. By selectively reusing relevant key-value pairs from a reference
prompt's cache, SemShareKV reduces redundant computation while maintaining
output quality. Experiments on diverse summarization datasets show up to
6.25$\times$ speedup and 42\% lower GPU memory usage with 5k tokens input, with
negligible quality degradation. These results highlight the potential of
semantic-aware cache sharing for efficient LLM inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study introduces a Hierarchical Error Correction (HEC) framework to enhance AI domain-specific performance by addressing systematic error patterns, resulting in significant performance improvements in multiple specialized tasks such as medical and legal analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to deliver high performance in specialized domains like medical coding, achieving only 45.9% accuracy; this gap necessitates targeted solutions.

Method: A three-stage Hierarchical Error Correction (HEC) framework was developed based on systematic error analysis across different layers: Knowledge, Reasoning, and Complexity.

Result: The framework demonstrated a significant average improvement of 11.2 percentage points across four specialized tasks and five LLM architectures, although it showed limitations in tasks with high baseline performance.

Conclusion: Systematic error analysis is critical to enhancing AI performance in moderate-baseline tasks in specialized domains, yet understanding the framework's boundaries is essential for effective deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models face significant performance challenges in specialized
domains, with state-of-the-art models achieving only 45.9% accuracy on medical
coding tasks. This study proposes a Hierarchical Error Correction (HEC)
framework that addresses domain-specific AI limitations through systematic
error analysis and targeted intervention strategies.
  We analyze error patterns across four specialized domains and find that AI
errors follow consistent hierarchical structures: Knowledge-layer errors
(58.4%), Reasoning-layer errors (39.6%), and Complexity-layer errors (2.0%).
Based on these patterns, we develop a three-stage correction framework that
addresses errors according to their hierarchical importance and demonstrates
that framework effectiveness correlates inversely with baseline task
performance.
  Experimental validation across medical transcription (4,921 cases), legal
document classification (1,000 cases), political bias detection (645 cases),
and legal reasoning (1,000 cases) shows consistent improvements. Cross-model
validation across five LLM architectures demonstrates average improvements of
11.2 percentage points (p < 0.001). However, analysis reveals framework
limitations in high-baseline tasks (>75% accuracy), where hierarchical
intervention may interfere with effective reasoning processes.
  The results suggest that systematic error analysis can guide effective AI
enhancement strategies in specialized domains, particularly for
moderate-baseline tasks, while highlighting the importance of understanding
framework boundaries for optimal deployment.

*Adrian Arnaiz-Rodriguez,Miguel Baidal,Erik Derner,Jenn Layton Annable,Mark Ball,Mark Ince,Elvira Perez Vallejos,Nuria Oliver*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper creates a taxonomy for identifying mental health crisis types and evaluates the performance of three large language models (LLMs) in detecting and responding appropriately to mental health crises.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mental health chatbots powered by LLMs are increasingly being used for emotional support, but their ability to detect and respond responsibly to mental health crises remains uncertain due to inadequate taxonomies, datasets, and evaluation benchmarks.

Method: The authors introduce a unified taxonomy of six mental health crisis categories, develop a diverse evaluation dataset, and propose an expert-designed protocol to assess the appropriateness of LLM responses. Additionally, they benchmark three LLMs in crisis detection and response generation.

Result: The study found that LLMs are generally reliable in addressing explicit mental health crises but often fail in nuanced situations. Open-weight models performed worse than their commercial counterparts, exhibiting higher rates of inappropriate and harmful responses.

Conclusion: The findings highlight critical shortcomings in current LLMs' ability to handle indirect or unclear signals, authentic replies, and user context alignment in mental health support. The paper offers resources for advancing research and innovation in safer, context-aware AI mental health interventions.

Abstract: The widespread use of chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) such
as ChatGPT and Llama has fundamentally reshaped how people seek information and
advice across domains. Increasingly, these chatbots are being used in
high-stakes contexts, including emotional support and mental health concerns.
While LLMs can offer scalable support, their ability to safely detect and
respond to acute mental health crises remains poorly understood. Progress is
hampered by the absence of unified crisis taxonomies, robust annotated
benchmarks, and empirical evaluations grounded in clinical best practices. In
this work, we address these gaps by introducing a unified taxonomy of six
clinically-informed mental health crisis categories, curating a diverse
evaluation dataset, and establishing an expert-designed protocol for assessing
response appropriateness. We systematically benchmark three state-of-the-art
LLMs for their ability to classify crisis types and generate safe, appropriate
responses. The results reveal that while LLMs are highly consistent and
generally reliable in addressing explicit crisis disclosures, significant risks
remain. A non-negligible proportion of responses are rated as inappropriate or
harmful, with responses generated by an open-weight model exhibiting higher
failure rates than those generated by the commercial ones. We also identify
systemic weaknesses in handling indirect or ambiguous risk signals, a reliance
on formulaic and inauthentic default replies, and frequent misalignment with
user context. These findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced
safeguards, improved crisis detection, and context-aware interventions in LLM
deployments. Our taxonomy, datasets, and evaluation framework lay the
groundwork for ongoing research and responsible innovation in AI-driven mental
health support, helping to minimize harm and better protect vulnerable users.

*Matteo Fuoli,Weihang Huang,Jeannette Littlemore,Sarah Turner,Ellen Wilding*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how large language models (LLMs) can automate metaphor identification in texts with methods like fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation, and prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing metaphors is crucial for understanding cognition, emotion, and ideology, but manual annotation has been constrained due to the context-sensitive nature of metaphors.

Method: The paper compares three methods: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), task-specific prompt engineering (zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought strategies), and fine-tuning on annotated data.

Result: Fine-tuning yielded the best performance with a median F1 score of 0.79. Discrepancies between human and LLM outputs were systematic and pointed to challenges in metaphor theory.

Conclusion: LLMs represent a promising tool to semi-automate metaphor identification and offer a platform to advance metaphor annotation protocols and theoretical frameworks.

Abstract: Metaphor is a pervasive feature of discourse and a powerful lens for
examining cognition, emotion, and ideology. Large-scale analysis, however, has
been constrained by the need for manual annotation due to the context-sensitive
nature of metaphor. This study investigates the potential of large language
models (LLMs) to automate metaphor identification in full texts. We compare
three methods: (i) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where the model is
provided with a codebook and instructed to annotate texts based on its rules
and examples; (ii) prompt engineering, where we design task-specific verbal
instructions; and (iii) fine-tuning, where the model is trained on hand-coded
texts to optimize performance. Within prompt engineering, we test zero-shot,
few-shot, and chain-of-thought strategies. Our results show that
state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs can achieve high accuracy, with fine-tuning
yielding a median F1 score of 0.79. A comparison of human and LLM outputs
reveals that most discrepancies are systematic, reflecting well-known grey
areas and conceptual challenges in metaphor theory. We propose that LLMs can be
used to at least partly automate metaphor identification and can serve as a
testbed for developing and refining metaphor identification protocols and the
theory that underpins them.

*Yoonna Jang,Kisu Yang,Isabelle Augenstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using filler tokens during inference to expand computational space in language models, optimizing problem-solving especially for smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether filler tokens used during inference can enhance reasoning capabilities of language models.

Method: Experiments were conducted on models (1.7B to 32B parameters), analyzing token types, placements, and attention dynamics in tasks like QA and math.

Result: Smaller models showed significant improvement, with SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct achieving a 12.372 percentage-point gain, especially when filler tokens were positioned before the 'Answer:' token.

Conclusion: Filler tokens enhance computational capacity instead of acting as redundant input, benefiting smaller models and improving problem-solving attention dynamics.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) rationale enables language models to use additional
task-related text for problem-solving, benefiting not only from detailed
reasoning steps but also from the expanded computational space of longer
inputs. Prior work has trained filler or special tokens to serve as additional
computation spaces. In this study, we investigate whether language models can
leverage artificially inserted sequences of filler tokens solely at inference.
We first identify effective token types, numbers, and insertion locations, then
examine at what stage of training models begin to exploit the expanded
computation space, and finally analyze dynamics within these spaces via
attention maps. Experiments on models ranging from 1.7B to 32B across
open-domain QA and math tasks show that appropriate token types and counts
vary, but placing filler tokens directly before the final 'Answer:' token is
most effective. Smaller models benefit most, up to 12.372 percentage points in
SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct, indicating that these spaces act as additional
computational capacity rather than redundant input. Attention maps reveal that
expanded spaces often continue the original attention mechanism and sometimes
focus on questions or answer options, suggesting meaningful computation for
problem-solving.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BOE-XSUM, a concise Spanish legal document summarization dataset, and evaluates the performance of fine-tuned language models, showing significant performance improvements over zero-shot alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of succinct summaries for Spanish documents, particularly in the legal domain, amidst growing information overload.

Method: A curated dataset of 3,648 entries from Spain's State Official Gazette (BOE) was created, and medium-sized LLMs were fine-tuned and evaluated against zero-shot models.

Result: Fine-tuned models outperformed general-purpose zero-shot models. The best-performing fine-tuned model achieved a 24% higher accuracy (41.6%) compared to the top zero-shot model (33.5%).

Conclusion: Fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets like BOE-XSUM substantially enhances summarization performance, highlighting the utility of curated datasets for specialized tasks.

Abstract: The ability to summarize long documents succinctly is increasingly important
in daily life due to information overload, yet there is a notable lack of such
summaries for Spanish documents in general, and in the legal domain in
particular. In this work, we present BOE-XSUM, a curated dataset comprising
3,648 concise, plain-language summaries of documents sourced from Spain's
``Bolet\'{\i}n Oficial del Estado'' (BOE), the State Official Gazette. Each
entry in the dataset includes a short summary, the original text, and its
document type label. We evaluate the performance of medium-sized large language
models (LLMs) fine-tuned on BOE-XSUM, comparing them to general-purpose
generative models in a zero-shot setting. Results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their non-specialized counterparts. Notably, the
best-performing model -- BERTIN GPT-J 6B (32-bit precision) -- achieves a 24\%
performance gain over the top zero-shot model, DeepSeek-R1 (accuracies of
41.6\% vs.\ 33.5\%).

### [313] [How Well Do LLMs Imitate Human Writing Style?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24930)
*Rebira Jemama,Rajesh Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a fast, training-free method for authorship verification and style imitation analysis that integrates TF-IDF character n-grams and transformer embeddings. The method achieves high accuracy and efficiency while providing insights into LLMs' stylistic fidelity across prompting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to understand whether large language models (LLMs) can accurately replicate the distinctive writing style of specific human authors and evaluate their stylistic fidelity without extensive training or tuning.

Method: The authors developed a training-free framework combining TF-IDF character n-grams with transformer embeddings. Text pairs are analyzed via empirical distance distributions, eliminating the need for supervised training or threshold tuning. The framework also tests LLMs across zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, and text completion prompting strategies.

Result: The framework achieved 97.5% accuracy on academic essays and 94.5% accuracy in cross-domain evaluation, while significantly reducing training time (91.8%) and memory usage (59%). Few-shot prompting led to up to 23.5x higher style-matching accuracy compared to zero-shot, and text completion prompting achieved 99.9% stylistic agreement.

Conclusion: The research highlights that stylistic fidelity in LLMs is highly influenced by prompting strategies rather than model size. Furthermore, these findings suggest that stylistic fidelity does not guarantee human-like unpredictability, establishing a reproducible basis for further investigation in authorship verification and style modeling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent text, but their ability to
replicate the distinctive style of a specific human author remains unclear. We
present a fast, training-free framework for authorship verification and style
imitation analysis. The method integrates TF-IDF character n-grams with
transformer embeddings and classifies text pairs through empirical distance
distributions, eliminating the need for supervised training or threshold
tuning. It achieves 97.5\% accuracy on academic essays and 94.5\% in
cross-domain evaluation, while reducing training time by 91.8\% and memory
usage by 59\% relative to parameter-based baselines. Using this framework, we
evaluate five LLMs from three separate families (Llama, Qwen, Mixtral) across
four prompting strategies - zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, and text completion.
Results show that the prompting strategy has a more substantial influence on
style fidelity than model size: few-shot prompting yields up to 23.5x higher
style-matching accuracy than zero-shot, and completion prompting reaches 99.9\%
agreement with the original author's style. Crucially, high-fidelity imitation
does not imply human-like unpredictability - human essays average a perplexity
of 29.5, whereas matched LLM outputs average only 15.2. These findings
demonstrate that stylistic fidelity and statistical detectability are
separable, establishing a reproducible basis for future work in authorship
modeling, detection, and identity-conditioned generation.

*Changsheng Zhao,Ernie Chang,Zechun Liu,Chia-Jung Chang,Wei Wen,Chen Lai,Rick Cao,Yuandong Tian,Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi,Yangyang Shi,Vikas Chandra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study challenges the belief that reasoning capabilities in language models require extremely large datasets, demonstrating that strong reasoning abilities can emerge with only ~2T tokens of curated high-quality data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to question the assumption that reasoning capabilities in large language models necessitate training on massive datasets (>10T tokens).

Method: By curating and resampling open-source datasets using designed metrics, the study demonstrates reasoning capabilities with smaller data scales. Models undergo pre-training followed by established post-training procedures.

Result: The MobileLLM-R1 series, trained on only 4.2T tokens of resampled datasets (~2T tokens base), achieves high reasoning scores like an AIME score of 15.5, outperforming competitors such as Qwen3 and other sub-billion-parameter models.

Conclusion: Quality over quantity in training data can yield strong reasoning abilities in smaller language models, making massive corpora unnecessary. This has significant implications for efficient model development.

Abstract: The paradigm shift in large language models (LLMs) from instinctive responses
to chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has fueled two prevailing assumptions: (1)
reasoning capabilities only emerge in sufficiently large models, and (2) such
capabilities require training on massive datasets. While the first assumption
has already been challenged by recent sub-billion-parameter reasoning models
such as Qwen3-0.6B and DeepSeek distilled variants, the second remains largely
unquestioned. In this work, we revisit the necessity of scaling to extremely
large corpora (>10T tokens) for reasoning emergence. By carefully curating and
resampling open-source datasets that we identify as beneficial under our
designed metrics, we demonstrate that strong reasoning abilities can emerge
with far less data. Specifically, we show that only ~2T tokens of high-quality
data are sufficient, and pre-training with 4.2T tokens on the dataset resampled
from these ~2T tokens, followed by a established post-training procedure,
enables the development of MobileLLM-R1, a series of sub-billion-parameter
reasoning models that substantially outperform prior models trained on fully
open-sourced data. For example, MobileLLM-R1-950M achieves an AIME score of
15.5, compared to just 0.6 for OLMo-2-1.48B and 0.3 for SmolLM-2-1.7B.
Remarkably, despite being trained on only 11.7% of the tokens compared to
Qwen3's proprietary 36T-token corpus for pretraining, MobileLLM-R1-950M matches
or surpasses Qwen3-0.6B across multiple reasoning benchmarks. To facilitate
further research in this direction, we have released the complete training
recipe, data sources, data mixing ratio, and model checkpoints, together with
the key insights obtained throughout this study.

*Linlu Gong,Ante Wang,Yunghwei Lai,Weizhi Ma,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents MAQuE, a benchmark for evaluating AI medical diagnostic questioning, highlighting gaps in their empathy and communication skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI doctors excel in diagnostics but lack other crucial skills like empathy, clear communication, and the ability to deal with diverse patient behaviors.

Method: MAQuE includes 3,000 simulated patients and evaluates AI questioning across five dimensions: task success, inquiry proficiency, dialogue competence, inquiry efficiency, and patient experience.

Result: State-of-the-art AI models face significant challenges, particularly in handling realistic patient behaviors, which negatively impact diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusion: While diagnostic AI models perform well in technical tasks, there is substantial room for advancement in their interaction skills to ensure effective real-world application.

Abstract: An effective physician should possess a combination of empathy, expertise,
patience, and clear communication when treating a patient. Recent advances have
successfully endowed AI doctors with expert diagnostic skills, particularly the
ability to actively seek information through inquiry. However, other essential
qualities of a good doctor remain overlooked. To bridge this gap, we present
MAQuE(Medical Agent Questioning Evaluation), the largest-ever benchmark for the
automatic and comprehensive evaluation of medical multi-turn questioning. It
features 3,000 realistically simulated patient agents that exhibit diverse
linguistic patterns, cognitive limitations, emotional responses, and tendencies
for passive disclosure. We also introduce a multi-faceted evaluation framework,
covering task success, inquiry proficiency, dialogue competence, inquiry
efficiency, and patient experience. Experiments on different LLMs reveal
substantial challenges across the evaluation aspects. Even state-of-the-art
models show significant room for improvement in their inquiry capabilities.
These models are highly sensitive to variations in realistic patient behavior,
which considerably impacts diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, our fine-grained
metrics expose trade-offs between different evaluation perspectives,
highlighting the challenge of balancing performance and practicality in
real-world clinical settings.

*Kaihong Li,Huichi Zhou,Bin Ma,Fangjun Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Recommender systems are prone to shilling attacks. This paper proposes SemanticShield, a detection framework integrating item-side semantics analyzed via large language models to identify such attacks, demonstrating strong effectiveness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses vulnerabilities in recommender systems caused by shilling attacks. Existing defenses primarily focus on user behavior, neglecting item-related features like semantic descriptions.

Method: This study introduces a two-stage framework combining behavioral criteria and large language models for semantic auditing. Specialized reinforcement fine-tuning optimizes detection through a lightweight model called SemanticShield.

Result: Experiments show SemanticShield effectively mitigates shilling attacks across six strategies. Tests against novel attack methods highlight its generalization strength.

Conclusion: SemanticShield improves shilling attack detection in recommender systems by leveraging item-side semantics and demonstrates robust effectiveness and adaptability across various scenarios.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) are widely used in e-commerce for personalized
suggestions, yet their openness makes them susceptible to shilling attacks,
where adversaries inject fake behaviors to manipulate recommendations. Most
existing defenses emphasize user-side behaviors while overlooking item-side
features such as titles and descriptions that can expose malicious intent. To
address this gap, we propose a two-stage detection framework that integrates
item-side semantics via large language models (LLMs). The first stage
pre-screens suspicious users using low-cost behavioral criteria, and the second
stage employs LLM-based auditing to evaluate semantic consistency. Furthermore,
we enhance the auditing model through reinforcement fine-tuning on a
lightweight LLM with carefully designed reward functions, yielding a
specialized detector called SemanticShield. Experiments on six representative
attack strategies demonstrate the effectiveness of SemanticShield against
shilling attacks, and further evaluation on previously unseen attack methods
shows its strong generalization capability. Code is available at

### [317] [Generalized Correctness Models: Learning Calibrated and Model-Agnostic Correctness Predictors from Historical Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24988)
*Hanqi Xiao,Vaidehi Patil,Hyunji Lee,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Confidence estimation for LLMs is a generalizable skill that can be improved using historical correctness data rather than relying on self-introspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the reliability of LLMs in critical applications by improving confidence estimation and addressing the limitations of relying solely on a model's self-judgment.

Method: The authors evaluate correctness prediction using historical correctness data, propose Generalized Correctness Models (GCMs) trained across multiple datasets, and explore in-context examples and post-hoc calibration as complementary techniques.

Result: GCMs demonstrated applicability across models and datasets for confidence estimation and showed that answer phrasing is a key predictor of correctness. Post-hoc calibration further enhanced accuracy.

Conclusion: Reliable confidence estimation for LLMs requires systematically encoding historical correctness rather than relying on model-specific abilities, and this skill is broadly generalizable.

Abstract: Generating accurate and calibrated confidence estimates is critical for
deploying LLMs in high-stakes or user-facing applications, and remains an open
challenge. Prior research has often framed confidence as a problem of eliciting
a model's "self-knowledge", i.e., the ability of an LLM to judge whether its
own answers are correct; this approach implicitly assumes that there is some
privileged information about the answer's correctness that is accessible to the
model itself. However, our experiments reveal that an LLM attempting to predict
the correctness of its own outputs generally performs no better than an
unrelated LLM. Moreover, we hypothesize that a key factor in building a
"Correctness Model" (CM) is exposure to a target model's historical
predictions. We propose multiple methods to inject this historical correctness
information, creating a Generalized Correctness Model (GCM). We first show that
GCMs can be trained on the correctness data from many LLMs and learn patterns
for correctness prediction applicable across datasets and models. We then use
CMs as a lens for studying the source of correctness prediction ability and its
generalization, systematically controlling their training data and finding that
answer phrasing is a strong predictor for correctness. We further explore
alternative methods of injecting history without training an LLM, finding that
including history as in-context examples can help improve correctness
prediction, and post-hoc calibration can provide complementary reductions in
calibration error. We evaluate GCMs based on Qwen3-8B across 5 model families
and the MMLU and TriviaQA datasets, as well as on a downstream selective
prediction task, finding that reliable LLM confidence estimation is a
generalizable and model-agnostic skill learned by systematically encoding
correctness history rather than a model-specific skill reliant on
self-introspection.

### [318] [Circuit Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25002)
*Somin Wadhwa,Silvio Amir,Byron C. Wallace*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Circuit distillation aligns internal representations between teacher and student models, outperforming traditional distillation in transferring algorithmic capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional model distillation focuses on behavioral mimicry but neglects the internal mechanisms of computations within models.

Method: The paper introduces 'circuit distillation,' a method aligning internal representations of teacher and student models via mechanisms such as functionally matching circuit components and implementing targeted loss functions.

Result: Circuit distillation demonstrated superior performance in tasks like entity tracking and theory of mind (ToM) over standard distillation, adjusting fewer student model parameters.

Conclusion: The feasibility of transferring computational mechanisms is established, enabling efficient and interpretable distillation of teacher capabilities into students.

Abstract: Model distillation typically focuses on behavioral mimicry, where a student
model is trained to replicate a teacher's output while treating its internal
computations as a black box. In this work we propose an alternative approach:
Distilling the underlying computational mechanisms implemented by a teacher
model. Specifically, we propose circuit distillation, which introduces an
objective to align internal representations between analogous circuit
components in teacher and student models. We propose a method to match
``functionally correspondent'' circuit components and introduce a loss
reflecting similarities between the representations that these induce. We
evaluate circuit distillation on entity tracking and theory of mind (ToM) tasks
using models from the Llama3 family. Our results demonstrate that circuit
distillation outperforms standard distillation, successfully transferring
algorithmic capabilities by adjusting only a small, targeted subset of student
model parameters. This work establishes the feasibility of transferring
mechanisms, which may in turn allow for efficient distillation of targeted
teacher capabilities via interpretable and controllable internal student
mechanisms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiDi-Instruct improves fast language generation by leveraging a pre-trained discrete diffusion language model (dLLM) and achieves notable performance and speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve fast and effective language text generation in the AI era.

Method: Introduced DiDi-Instruct by training on a pre-trained masked discrete diffusion language model (dLLM) and developed new techniques for improved learning and inference.

Result: DiDi-Instruct achieves 64x acceleration, better performance over GPT-2 and dLLMs, with low entropy loss and reduced training time while maintaining robustness.

Conclusion: DiDi-Instruct is a practical, efficient, and effective distillation method for fast language generation; models and code will be released publicly.

Abstract: Fast generation of language texts is the holy grail that people pursue in the
AI era. In this work, we introduced Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct
(DiDi-Instruct), a training-based method that leads to fast language generation
models by initializing from a pre-trained (masked) discrete diffusion language
model (dLLM). The resulting DiDi-Instruct model outperforms the dLLM
counterparts and the GPT-2 baseline with 64x acceleration. In the theoretical
part of the paper, we build the foundation of DiDi-Instruct in a framework of
integral KL-divergence minimization, with practical training algorithms. We
also introduce techniques like grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state
matching, and the reward-guided ancestral sampler (RGAS) that significantly
improve the training stability, the model coverage, and the inference
performances. On OpenWebText, DiDi-Instruct outperforms all accelerated
language generation models as well as the GPT-2 baseline and the standard
dLLMs, achieving sample perplexities ranging from 62.2 (8 NFEs) to 18.4 (128
NFEs). These performance gains are accomplished with a negligible entropy loss
of about 1% and 20x less additional training wall-clock time. We further
validate the robustness and effectiveness of DiDi-Instruct through extensive
ablation studies, model scaling, and the generation of discrete protein
sequences. In conclusion, DiDi-Instruct is an efficient yet effective
distillation method, enabling language generation in the blink of an eye. We
will release both code and models at github.com/haoyangzheng-ai/didi-instruct.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes GateMABSA, a new architecture for multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis, using specialized mLSTMs to overcome challenges of noisy visual signals and cross-modal alignment, demonstrating superior performance on Twitter datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal ABSA models face problems in filtering noisy visual information and aligning aspects with cross-modal content effectively. There is a need for more refined techniques to address these challenges.

Method: GateMABSA architecture employs three specialized mLSTMs: Syn-mLSTM for syntactic structure, Sem-mLSTM for aspect-semantic alignment, and Fuse-mLSTM for selective multimodal fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments show that GateMABSA performs better than several baseline models on two Twitter benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: GateMABSA's gated structure and use of three customized mLSTMs provide a significant improvement in multimodal ABSA performance, emphasizing its practical and academic value.

Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has recently advanced into the
multimodal domain, where user-generated content often combines text and images.
However, existing multimodal ABSA (MABSA) models struggle to filter noisy
visual signals, and effectively align aspects with opinion-bearing content
across modalities. To address these challenges, we propose GateMABSA, a novel
gated multimodal architecture that integrates syntactic, semantic, and
fusion-aware mLSTM. Specifically, GateMABSA introduces three specialized
mLSTMs: Syn-mLSTM to incorporate syntactic structure, Sem-mLSTM to emphasize
aspect--semantic relevance, and Fuse-mLSTM to perform selective multimodal
fusion. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Twitter datasets demonstrate
that GateMABSA outperforms several baselines.

*Marco Bronzini,Carlo Nicolini,Bruno Lepri,Jacopo Staiano,Andrea Passerini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach, the Hyperdimensional Probe, to decode and interpret information from the vector space of Large Language Models (LLMs), overcoming limitations of existing interpretability methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve understanding and interpretability of internal representations in LLMs, addressing the limitations of current methods like direct logit attribution and sparse autoencoders.

Method: The paper introduces the Hyperdimensional Probe, which employs Vector Symbolic Architectures to project the LLM's residual stream into interpretable concepts, validated through controlled tasks and a question-answering setting.

Result: The Hyperdimensional Probe consistently extracts meaningful concepts across different LLMs, embedding sizes, and input types, while identifying model failures.

Conclusion: The work enhances the ability to decode structured and interpretable features from the vector spaces of LLMs, advancing the field of model interpretability.

Abstract: Despite their capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain opaque with
limited understanding of their internal representations. Current
interpretability methods, such as direct logit attribution (DLA) and sparse
autoencoders (SAEs), provide restricted insight due to limitations such as the
model's output vocabulary or unclear feature names. This work introduces
Hyperdimensional Probe, a novel paradigm for decoding information from the LLM
vector space. It combines ideas from symbolic representations and neural
probing to project the model's residual stream into interpretable concepts via
Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs). This probe combines the strengths of SAEs
and conventional probes while overcoming their key limitations. We validate our
decoding paradigm with controlled input-completion tasks, probing the model's
final state before next-token prediction on inputs spanning syntactic pattern
recognition, key-value associations, and abstract inference. We further assess
it in a question-answering setting, examining the state of the model both
before and after text generation. Our experiments show that our probe reliably
extracts meaningful concepts across varied LLMs, embedding sizes, and input
domains, also helping identify LLM failures. Our work advances information
decoding in LLM vector space, enabling extracting more informative,
interpretable, and structured features from neural representations.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel large language model (LLM)-based post-processing method for error correction in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, specifically targeting disordered speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve robustness and generalization of LLMs in ASR error correction for disordered speech, addressing challenges such as uncertainty and overcorrection in ASR transcript revisions.

Method: The researchers introduce confidence-informed prompting, where word-level uncertainty is embedded into LLM training. They fine-tune LLaMA 3.1 and compare it against transcript-only fine-tuning and confidence-based filtering approaches.

Result: Their method achieves a significant reduction in word error rate (WER), seeing a 10% improvement on spontaneous speech from the Speech Accessibility Project and a 47% improvement on the TORGO dataset.

Conclusion: Embedding confidence prompts into LLM training enhances the correction robustness for impaired speech, demonstrating its potential for improving ASR systems that handle disordered speech.

Abstract: We investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) as post-processing
modules for automatic speech recognition (ASR), focusing on their ability to
perform error correction for disordered speech. In particular, we propose
confidence-informed prompting, where word-level uncertainty estimates are
embedded directly into LLM training to improve robustness and generalization
across speakers and datasets. This approach directs the model to uncertain ASR
regions and reduces overcorrection. We fine-tune a LLaMA 3.1 model and compare
our approach to both transcript-only fine-tuning and post hoc confidence-based
filtering. Evaluations show that our method achieves a 10% relative WER
reduction compared to naive LLM correction on the Speech Accessibility Project
spontaneous speech and a 47% reduction on TORGO, demonstrating the
effectiveness of confidence-aware fine-tuning for impaired speech.

*Simeng Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the capability of Transformers in generating detailed step-by-step execution traces for programs, showcasing their strong performance within distributions while struggling at generalizing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand Transformers' ability to generate program trace execution for synthetic programs, particularly investigating their generalization capabilities.

Method: Developed small Transformer models with diverse modifications including different position encodings, altered softmax layers, hybrid designs, and short convolutions.

Result: Models demonstrated strong in-distribution performance but showed systematic failures in generalizing across factors like program length and trace steps; some designs improved generalization.

Conclusion: Transformers with specific design tweaks can enhance generalization in program trace execution tasks, though they still face systematic limitations.

Abstract: We study Transformers on the task \emph{program trace generation} (PTG),
where models produce step-by-step execution traces for synthetic programs.
Unlike existing algorithmic problems, PTG externalizes reasoning through long
traces where each step is trivial. We train small Transformers with diverse
modifications, including alternative position encodings, softmax replacements,
hybrid model, and short convolutions. While these models achieve strong
in-distribution accuracy, they exhibit systematic failures when generalizing to
various factors (e.g., program length, trace steps), though some designs
significantly improve generalization.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DataMind, a framework for creating robust, open-source, data-analytic agents using innovative training strategies and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While data-analytic agents are critical for advancing AI-driven scientific discovery, current solutions are limited by reliance on proprietary models, insufficient open-source resources, and challenges in handling complex reasoning tasks and diverse data formats.

Method: DataMind uses a fine-grained task taxonomy, recursive task composition, knowledge-augmented sampling, combined training strategies, and a stable multi-turn rollout framework. It also introduces DataMind-12K, a dataset designed for diverse data-analytic tasks.

Result: DataMind-14B achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 71.16% average benchmark score, outperforming models like DeepSeek-V3.1 and GPT-5. DataMind-7B leads among open-source models with a 68.10% score.

Conclusion: DataMind provides a scalable solution for building high-performing, open-source data-analytic agents. Its contributions, including the DataMind-12K dataset and training strategies, offer valuable insights for the AI community. The work represents significant progress in open-source data analytics.

Abstract: Data-analytic agents are emerging as a key catalyst for automated scientific
discovery and for the vision of Innovating AI. Current approaches, however,
rely heavily on prompt engineering over proprietary models, while open-source
models struggle to face diverse-format, large-scale data files and
long-horizon, multi-step reasoning that real-world analytics demands. This
paper introduces DataMind, a scalable data synthesis and agent training recipe
designed to build generalist data-analytic agents. DataMind tackles three key
challenges in building open-source data-analytic agents, including insufficient
data resources, improper training strategy, and unstable code-based multi-turn
rollout. Concretely, DataMind applies 1) a fine-grained task taxonomy and a
recursive easy-to-hard task composition mechanism to increase the diversity and
difficulty of synthesized queries; 2) a knowledge-augmented trajectory sampling
strategy followed by model-based and rule-based filtering; 3) a dynamically
adjustable training objective combining both SFT and RL losses; 4) a
memory-frugal and stable code-based multi-turn rollout framework. Built on
DataMind, we curate DataMind-12K, a high-quality trajectory set spanning
diverse domains, task categories, and data file formats for data-analytic
tasks. Trained on DataMind-12K, our DataMind-14B achieves state-of-the-art with
an average score of 71.16% on multiple data analysis benchmarks, outperforming
the strongest proprietary baselines DeepSeek-V3.1 and GPT-5. Our DataMind-7B
also performs best among all open-source models with a score of 68.10%. We also
incorporate some empirical insights gained from our exploratory trials into the
analysis experiments, aiming to provide actionable insights about agentic
training for the community. We will release DataMind-12K and DataMind-7B,14B
for the community's future research.

TL;DR: jina-reranker-v3 is a compact 0.6B parameter multilingual reranker that introduces a novel interaction methodology, achieving state-of-the-art BEIR scores efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance document reranking using a smaller, yet highly effective multilingual model to improve performance in information retrieval tasks.

Method: The model employs a causal self-attention mechanism between query and documents within the same context window, enabling strong cross-document interactions before extracting final embeddings.

Result: The model achieves 61.94 nDCG@10, which is state-of-the-art in BEIR benchmarks, and it accomplishes this being 10 times smaller than comparable generative listwise rerankers.

Conclusion: jina-reranker-v3 demonstrates a compact yet powerful architecture that improves document reranking capabilities while maintaining efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: jina-reranker-v3 is a 0.6B parameter multilingual document reranker that
introduces a novel last but not late interaction. Unlike late interaction
models such as ColBERT that perform separate encoding followed by multi-vector
matching, our approach conducts causal self-attention between query and
documents within the same context window, enabling rich cross-document
interactions before extracting contextual embeddings from the last token of
each document. This compact architecture achieves state-of-the-art BEIR
performance with 61.94 nDCG@10 while being ten times smaller than generative
listwise rerankers.

### [326] [Towards Trustworthy Lexical Simplification: Exploring Safety and Efficiency with Small LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25086)
*Akio Hayakawa,Stefan Bott,Horacio Saggion*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in lexical simplification for vulnerable groups using small LLMs, proposing methods to balance performance, efficiency, and safety, and creating a benchmark for careful real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vulnerable user groups require safe and accessible lexical simplification tools that respect privacy and operate efficiently in constrained environments.

Method: The study utilizes small LLMs with knowledge distillation, synthesized data, and in-context learning, coupled with a filtering strategy based on output probability to address harmful simplifications.

Result: Experiments across five languages show knowledge distillation improves metric scores but poses a safety trade-off; the filtering strategy effectively suppresses harmful simplifications while preserving beneficial ones.

Conclusion: This framework provides a benchmark for deploying small LLMs in lexical simplification tasks with careful trade-offs between efficiency, performance, and safety, enabling responsible application in real-world settings.

Abstract: Despite their strong performance, large language models (LLMs) face
challenges in real-world application of lexical simplification (LS),
particularly in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments.
Moreover, since vulnerable user groups (e.g., people with disabilities) are one
of the key target groups of this technology, it is crucial to ensure the safety
and correctness of the output of LS systems. To address these issues, we
propose an efficient framework for LS systems that utilizes small LLMs
deployable in local environments. Within this framework, we explore knowledge
distillation with synthesized data and in-context learning as baselines. Our
experiments in five languages evaluate model outputs both automatically and
manually. Our manual analysis reveals that while knowledge distillation boosts
automatic metric scores, it also introduces a safety trade-off by increasing
harmful simplifications. Importantly, we find that the model's output
probability is a useful signal for detecting harmful simplifications.
Leveraging this, we propose a filtering strategy that suppresses harmful
simplifications while largely preserving beneficial ones. This work establishes
a benchmark for efficient and safe LS with small LLMs. It highlights the key
trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and safety, and demonstrates a
promising approach for safe real-world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of open-ended benchmarks capable of evaluating personalized scenarios in autonomous research agents, coupled with reliance on close-ended criteria, limits the advancement of DRAs.

Method: The paper introduces a benchmark with 50 diverse research tasks across 10 domains, matched with 25 user profiles incorporating structured attributes and dynamic contexts. The evaluation uses the PQR Framework for Personalization Alignment, Content Quality, and Factual Reliability.

Result: Experiments across various systems underscored both current capabilities and limitations in personalized deep research, revealing gaps in handling user-specific tasks effectively.

Conclusion: This benchmark provides a strong foundation for developing and evaluating personalized AI research agents, advancing toward truly tailored autonomous assistants.

Abstract: Deep Research Agents (DRAs) can autonomously conduct complex investigations
and generate comprehensive reports, demonstrating strong real-world potential.
However, existing evaluations mostly rely on close-ended benchmarks, while
open-ended deep research benchmarks remain scarce and typically neglect
personalized scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Personalized Deep
Research Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating personalization in DRAs. It
pairs 50 diverse research tasks across 10 domains with 25 authentic user
profiles that combine structured persona attributes with dynamic real-world
contexts, yielding 250 realistic user-task queries. To assess system
performance, we propose the PQR Evaluation Framework, which jointly measures
(P) Personalization Alignment, (Q) Content Quality, and (R) Factual
Reliability. Our experiments on a range of systems highlight current
capabilities and limitations in handling personalized deep research. This work
establishes a rigorous foundation for developing and evaluating the next
generation of truly personalized AI research assistants.

Motivation: Understanding the utility of knowledge triple extraction in the era of LLMs for QA systems.

Method: Benchmarking LLMs using web-based QA with knowledge extraction annotations and analyzing augmentation benefits.

Result: Web-scale knowledge extraction is tough for LLMs, but augmentation improves QA performance.

Conclusion: Knowledge triple extraction remains useful, influencing strategies for effective LLM-based QA applications.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
web-based Question Answering (QA) systems over semi-structured content, raising
questions about the continued utility of knowledge extraction for question
answering. This paper investigates the value of triple extraction in this new
paradigm by extending an existing benchmark with knowledge extraction
annotations and evaluating commercial and open-source LLMs of varying sizes.
Our results show that web-scale knowledge extraction remains a challenging task

*Ivan Vykopal,Antonia Karamolegkou,Jaroslav Kopčan,Qiwei Peng,Tomáš Javůrek,Michal Gregor,Marián Šimko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates six multilingual large language models (LLMs) for cross-lingual fact-checking, exploring language and retrieval biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address and understand the biases present in multilingual LLMs, especially the language and retrieval biases affecting cross-lingual fact-checking.

Method: Evaluates six multilingual LLMs using multilingual prompting and tests performance across 20 languages using the AMC-16K dataset; investigates retrieval bias using multilingual embedding models.

Result: Finds disparities in monolingual and cross-lingual performance, persistent biases in LLM behavior, and skewed retrieval favoring popular claims.

Conclusion: Persistent biases in language models and information retrieval systems hinder equitable multilingual fact-checking; improvements are needed in prompting strategies and retrieval mechanisms.

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful capabilities for
cross-lingual fact-checking. However, these models often exhibit language bias,
performing disproportionately better on high-resource languages such as English
than on low-resource counterparts. We also present and inspect a novel concept
- retrieval bias, when information retrieval systems tend to favor certain
information over others, leaving the retrieval process skewed. In this paper,
we study language and retrieval bias in the context of Previously Fact-Checked
Claim Detection (PFCD). We evaluate six open-source multilingual LLMs across 20
languages using a fully multilingual prompting strategy, leveraging the AMC-16K
dataset. By translating task prompts into each language, we uncover disparities
in monolingual and cross-lingual performance and identify key trends based on
model family, size, and prompting strategy. Our findings highlight persistent
bias in LLM behavior and offer recommendations for improving equity in
multilingual fact-checking. To investigate retrieval bias, we employed
multilingual embedding models and look into the frequency of retrieved claims.
Our analysis reveals that certain claims are retrieved disproportionately
across different posts, leading to inflated retrieval performance for popular
claims while under-representing less common ones.

### [330] [Paired by the Teacher: Turning Unpaired Data into High-Fidelity Pairs for Low-Resource Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25144)
*Yen-Ju Lu,Thomas Thebaud,Laureano Moro-Velazquez,Najim Dehak,Jesus Villalba*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Paired by the Teacher (PbT), a method to synthesize paired input-output data without manual labeling for low-resource natural language generation scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In low-resource NLG scenarios, there is often a lack of paired data, only raw inputs or outputs are available, forcing reliance on few examples or expensive synthetic data from large models.

Method: PbT utilizes a teacher LLM to create a concise intermediate representation (IR) from unpaired data, trains a student model to reconstruct inputs from these IRs, and then generates high-quality synthetic input-output pairs.

Result: PbT-trained student models outperform those relying on large LLM-generated corpora, with improvements in multiple benchmarks and reduced annotation costs while retaining high fidelity and style alignment.

Conclusion: PbT efficiently generates paired data for NLG tasks, closing performance gaps while reducing costs, making it a practical solution for low-resource settings.

Abstract: We present Paired by the Teacher (PbT), a two-stage teacher-student pipeline
that synthesizes accurate input-output pairs without human labels or parallel
data. In many low-resource natural language generation (NLG) scenarios,
practitioners may have only raw outputs, like highlights, recaps, or questions,
or only raw inputs, such as articles, dialogues, or paragraphs, but seldom
both. This mismatch forces small models to learn from very few examples or rely
on costly, broad-scope synthetic examples produced by large LLMs. PbT addresses
this by asking a teacher LLM to compress each unpaired example into a concise
intermediate representation (IR), and training a student to reconstruct inputs
from IRs. This enables outputs to be paired with student-generated inputs,
yielding high-quality synthetic data. We evaluate PbT on five
benchmarks-document summarization (XSum, CNNDM), dialogue summarization
(SAMSum, DialogSum), and question generation (SQuAD)-as well as an unpaired
setting on SwitchBoard (paired with DialogSum summaries). An 8B student trained
only on PbT data outperforms models trained on 70 B teacher-generated corpora
and other unsupervised baselines, coming within 1.2 ROUGE-L of human-annotated
pairs and closing 82% of the oracle gap at one-third the annotation cost of
direct synthesis. Human evaluation on SwitchBoard further confirms that only
PbT produces concise, faithful summaries aligned with the target style,
highlighting its advantage of generating in-domain sources that avoid the
mismatch, limiting direct synthesis.

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel method for training large language models (LLMs) with 4-bit floating-point precision, demonstrating comparable performance to 8-bit precision while improving computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the efficiency of pretraining LLMs by reducing the computational and energy costs associated with training on large-scale datasets, particularly leveraging narrower precision formats like 4-bit floating point (FP4).

Method: The authors propose a multi-faceted approach including Random Hadamard transforms to control block-level outliers, two-dimensional quantization for consistent computation, stochastic rounding for unbiased gradients, and selective use of high-precision layers.

Result: The method was validated by training a 12-billion-parameter model on 10 trillion tokens in 4-bit precision, achieving training loss and downstream accuracies comparable to models trained in 8-bit precision.

Conclusion: This study provides evidence that training LLMs with NVFP4 precision using the proposed techniques is effective and marks a significant advancement in resource-efficient LLM training methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) today are powerful problem solvers across many
domains, and they continue to get stronger as they scale in model size,
training set size, and training set quality, as shown by extensive research and
experimentation across the industry. Training a frontier model today requires
on the order of tens to hundreds of yottaflops, which is a massive investment
of time, compute, and energy. Improving pretraining efficiency is therefore
essential to enable the next generation of even more capable LLMs. While 8-bit
floating point (FP8) training is now widely adopted, transitioning to even
narrower precision, such as 4-bit floating point (FP4), could unlock additional
improvements in computational speed and resource utilization. However,
quantization at this level poses challenges to training stability, convergence,
and implementation, notably for large-scale models trained on long token
horizons.
  In this study, we introduce a novel approach for stable and accurate training
of large language models (LLMs) using the NVFP4 format. Our method integrates
Random Hadamard transforms (RHT) to bound block-level outliers, employs a
two-dimensional quantization scheme for consistent representations across both
the forward and backward passes, utilizes stochastic rounding for unbiased
gradient estimation, and incorporates selective high-precision layers. We
validate our approach by training a 12-billion-parameter model on 10 trillion
tokens -- the longest publicly documented training run in 4-bit precision to
date. Our results show that the model trained with our NVFP4-based pretraining
technique achieves training loss and downstream task accuracies comparable to
an FP8 baseline. These findings highlight that NVFP4, when combined with our
training approach, represents a major step forward in narrow-precision LLM
training algorithms.

Motivation: Existing methods for paper quality estimation suffer from high inference costs and scale inconsistencies. A solution is needed for efficient and accurate assessment of scientific papers.

Method: NAIPv2 utilizes pairwise learning within domain-year groups to enhance reviewer rating consistency and employs the Review Tendency Signal (RTS) to integrate reviewer scores and confidences probabilistically.

Result: NAIPv2 achieves 78.2% AUC and 0.432 Spearman correlation, demonstrates strong generalization across unseen datasets, and overcomes limitations in existing methods.

Conclusion: NAIPv2 provides a debiased, efficient, and scalable approach for paper quality estimation, representing progress toward intelligent scientific assessment systems.

Abstract: The ability to estimate the quality of scientific papers is central to how
both humans and AI systems will advance scientific knowledge in the future.
However, existing LLM-based estimation methods suffer from high inference cost,
whereas the faster direct score regression approach is limited by scale
inconsistencies. We present NAIPv2, a debiased and efficient framework for
paper quality estimation. NAIPv2 employs pairwise learning within domain-year
groups to reduce inconsistencies in reviewer ratings and introduces the Review
Tendency Signal (RTS) as a probabilistic integration of reviewer scores and
confidences. To support training and evaluation, we further construct NAIDv2, a
large-scale dataset of 24,276 ICLR submissions enriched with metadata and
detailed structured content. Trained on pairwise comparisons but enabling
efficient pointwise prediction at deployment, NAIPv2 achieves state-of-the-art
performance (78.2% AUC, 0.432 Spearman), while maintaining scalable,
linear-time efficiency at inference. Notably, on unseen NeurIPS submissions, it
further demonstrates strong generalization, with predicted scores increasing
consistently across decision categories from Rejected to Oral. These findings
establish NAIPv2 as a debiased and scalable framework for automated paper
quality estimation, marking a step toward future scientific intelligence
systems. Code and dataset are released at

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Truthful Text Summarization (TTS) framework to improve factual robustness in text synthesization tasks without relying on ground-truth labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern search and answer systems, using large language models (LLMs), often face challenges due to conflicting texts and adversarial content, leading to inaccuracies in synthesized responses.

Method: The framework decomposes synthesized texts into atomic claims, elicits stances from sources, scores them via a multi-task peer-prediction mechanism for informative agreement, and filters unreliable sources before re-summarizing.

Result: TTS enhances factual accuracy and robustness while maintaining fluency, aligning source exposure with corroboration and discouraging manipulative behavior.

Conclusion: The proposed TTS framework incentivizes truthful reporting by making it a utility-maximizing strategy, offering a reliable approach for truthful text summarization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in modern search and
answer systems to synthesize multiple, sometimes conflicting, texts into a
single response, yet current pipelines offer weak incentives for sources to be
accurate and are vulnerable to adversarial content. We introduce Truthful Text
Summarization (TTS), an incentive-aligned framework that improves factual
robustness without ground-truth labels. TTS (i) decomposes a draft synthesis
into atomic claims, (ii) elicits each source's stance on every claim, (iii)
scores sources with an adapted multi-task peer-prediction mechanism that
rewards informative agreement, and (iv) filters unreliable sources before
re-summarizing. We establish formal guarantees that align a source's incentives
with informative honesty, making truthful reporting the utility-maximizing
strategy. Experiments show that TTS improves factual accuracy and robustness
while preserving fluency, aligning exposure with informative corroboration and
disincentivizing manipulation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Learn2PD, a framework for adaptive token filtering to enhance parallel decoding in LLMs, achieving significant speedups while retaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive decoding in LLMs is limited by sequential steps, and existing parallel decoding strategies are not adaptive to input-specific characteristics, producing inefficiencies.

Method: Learn2PD trains a lightweight filter model post-training to predict if a token matches the final output, enabling adaptive parallel decoding. Additionally, it includes End-of-Text Prediction (EoTP) to avoid redundant decoding.

Result: The method achieves up to a 22.58x speedup without performance loss, and up to 57.51x speedup when used with KV-Cache, as demonstrated on the LLaDA benchmark.

Conclusion: Learn2PD enables more flexible and efficient parallel decoding for LLMs, bridging speed and quality trade-offs across various NLP tasks.

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ sequential steps for $n$ tokens, fundamentally limiting
inference throughput. Recent diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs) enable parallel token
generation through iterative denoising. However, current parallel decoding
strategies rely on fixed, input-agnostic heuristics (e.g., confidence
thresholds), which fail to adapt to input-specific characteristics, resulting
in suboptimal speed-quality trade-offs across diverse NLP tasks. In this work,
we explore a more flexible and dynamic approach to parallel decoding. We
propose Learning to Parallel Decode (Learn2PD), a framework that trains a
lightweight and adaptive filter model to predict, for each token position,
whether the current prediction matches the final output. This learned filter
approximates an oracle parallel decoding strategy that unmasks tokens only when
correctly predicted. Importantly, the filter model is learned in a
post-training manner, requiring only a small amount of computation to optimize
it (minute-level GPU time). Additionally, we introduce End-of-Text Prediction
(EoTP) to detect decoding completion at the end of sequence, avoiding redundant
decoding of padding tokens. Experiments on the LLaDA benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves up to 22.58$\times$ speedup without any performance drop,
and up to 57.51$\times$ when combined with KV-Cache.

Motivation: The paper aims to improve AI deep research agents by enabling complex reasoning tasks through better interaction with external tools in transparent environments.

Method: Developing InfoAgent involved constructing entity trees, employing data synthesis techniques like entity fuzzification, post-training the model via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, and utilizing a self-hosted search infrastructure.

Result: InfoAgent demonstrated significant improvement, achieving higher accuracy rates on benchmarks such as BrowseComp (15.3%), BrowseComp-ZH (29.2%), and Xbench-DS (40.4%) compared to other open-source agents.

Conclusion: InfoAgent's innovative approach to data synthesis, coupled with post-training techniques and self-hosted infrastructure, represents a tangible step forward for deep research agents in AI applications.

Abstract: Building Large Language Model agents that expand their capabilities by
interacting with external tools represents a new frontier in AI research and
applications. In this paper, we introduce InfoAgent, a deep research agent
powered by an innovative data synthesis pipeline and orchestrated web search
tools. To construct challenging, hard-to-find queries,we build entity trees and
apply sub-tree sampling with entity fuzzification to systematically increase
question difficulty. Unlike prior work that relies heavily on commercial search
tools, we develop a dedicated self-hosted search infrastructure, enhancing
transparency of agent environments and facilitating further advancement of
agent capacity. We evaluate the effectiveness of our data pipeline by measuring
the average number of tool calls required to correctly answer a question, and
also show that our agent yields better performance when equipped with our
tools. Our \mbox{InfoAgent} is post-trained from Qwen3-14B using a two-stage
recipe: cold-start supervised finetuning to instill long-horizon search
behaviors, followed by reinforcement learning which significantly improves
reasoning-driven tool use. With our methods, InfoAgent achieves 15.3\% accuracy
on BrowseComp, 29.2\% on BrowseComp-ZH, and 40.4\% on Xbench-DS, outperforming
prior open-source deep research agents such as WebSailor-72B and DeepDive-32B.

Motivation: To address performance disparities in LLMs across languages and cultural contexts, using real-world, culturally rich data.

Method: The researchers built a dataset from the Romanian game show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" using OCR, automated extraction, and manual verification, enriched with metadata. LLMs were evaluated on this dataset and compared across cultural and linguistic settings.

Result: LLMs performed better on international questions (80-95% accuracy) than on Romanian-specific cultural questions (50-75%), highlighting cultural context's role.

Conclusion: The study stresses the need for culturally-aware NLP systems and provides actionable insights for multilingual applications, especially in education.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate varying performance across languages
and cultural contexts. This study introduces a novel, culturally-rich,
multilingual dataset derived from video recordings of the Romanian game show
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" (Vrei s\u{a} fii Milionar?). We employed an
innovative process combining optical character recognition (OCR), automated
text extraction, and manual verification to collect question-answer pairs,
enriching them with metadata including question domain (e.g., biology,
history), cultural relevance (Romanian-specific vs. international), and
difficulty. Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs, including Romanian-adapted
models, on this dataset revealed significant performance disparities: models
consistently achieve higher accuracy (80-95%) on international questions
compared to Romanian-specific cultural questions (50-75%). We further
investigate these differences through experiments involving machine translation
of Romanian questions into English and cross-lingual tests using a comparable
dataset in French. Our findings underscore the impact of cultural context and
data source on LLM performance and offer practical insights for building
robust, culturally-aware multilingual NLP systems, especially in educational
domains. The dataset is publicly available at Hugging Face.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'VocabTrim,' a training-free method to improve speculative decoding efficiency by reconstructing the drafter's language model head to contain fewer tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in drafter-based speculative decoding methods caused by large vocabularies, particularly in memory-bound environments.

Method: The technique focuses on limiting the vocabulary during drafting by reconstructing the drafter's LM head using tokens frequently sampled by the target model.

Result: VocabTrim reduces drafting latency while maintaining acceptable accuracy, achieving notable performance improvements like a 16% speed-up for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on Spec-Bench.

Conclusion: VocabTrim improves speculative decoding speed without training modification, making it particularly useful for edge devices in memory-bound scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simple training-free technique to improve the
performance of drafter-based speculative decoding (SpD) methods that
incorporates language modeling head (LM head) during drafting process. A
drafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language
models, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree
consisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target
model, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered
that the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies
of the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the
vocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We
first identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an
unnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs
with very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim,
to mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in
memory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain
only a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the
vocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting
slightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting
latency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices,
resulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can
boost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically
by 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.

*Adrian-Marius Dumitran,Alexandra-Mihaela Danila,Angela-Liliana Dumitran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRILE, a benchmark for evaluating NLP models on Romanian language multiple-choice exams, highlighting gaps in multilingual and Romanian-specific models' linguistic abilities and explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the unclear pedagogical value of LLMs for low-resource languages, specifically focusing on Romanian's linguistic and explanatory capabilities.

Method: The authors collected 1,151 questions from Romanian exams and evaluated seven LLMs on their ability to select correct answers and provide accurate explanations.

Result: The best-performing model achieved 83% accuracy, but most open-weight models scored below 65%. Additionally, 48% of their explanations had factual or pedagogical errors, revealing challenges in low-resource language NLP.

Conclusion: GRILE offers a novel benchmark for assessing educational NLP in Romanian, identifying shortcomings in existing models and fostering advancements in trustworthy, low-resource language applications.

Abstract: LLMs (Large language models) have revolutionized NLP (Natural Language
Processing), yet their pedagogical value for low-resource languages remains
unclear. We present GRILE (Grammar Romanian Inference and Language
Explanations) , the first open benchmark of 1,151 multiple-choice questions
harvested from Romanian high-stakes exams (National Evaluation, Baccalaureate,
university admissions). GRILE enables us to probe two complementary abilities
of seven state-of-the-art multilingual and Romanian-specific LLMs: (i)
selecting the correct answer, and (ii) producing linguistically accurate
explanations. While Gemini 2.5 Pro reaches 83% accuracy, most open-weight
models stay below 65%, and 48% of their explanations contain factual or
pedagogical flaws according to expert review. A detailed error analysis
pinpoints systematic weaknesses in morphology and in applying the latest DOOM3
orthographic norms. All data, code and a public web demo are released to
catalyze future research. Our findings expose open challenges for trustworthy
educational NLP in low-resource settings and establish GRILE as a new test-bed
for controllable explanation generation and evaluation.

*Shubhashis Roy Dipta,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Q2E, a method for zero-shot multilingual text-to-video retrieval that enhances query comprehension using LLMs and VLMs and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by leveraging latent parametric knowledge from LLMs and VLMs.

Method: The proposed method, Q2E (Query-to-Event decomposition), enhances human query understanding by breaking down queries using LLMs/VLMs and adopts entropy-based fusion scoring for multimodal data integration.

Result: Q2E outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines across two diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, showing significant improvements by integrating audio information.

Conclusion: Q2E advances zero-shot text-to-video retrieval by effectively combining multimodal knowledge and improving query comprehension. The authors provide code and data for future research.

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and
leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the
identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video
retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

### [341] [Pathological Truth Bias in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22674)
*Yash Thube*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MATS (Multimodal Audit for Truthful Spatialization) to test Vision Language Models' (VLMs) ability to handle visually contradicted spatial statements. Metrics like SCS and IAR are utilized. Generative VLMs fail more often compared to contrastive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard benchmarks for Vision Language Models fail to capture systematic failures impacting real-world trust.

Method: The paper develops MATS, including metrics SCS and IAR, and tests model performance. Activation patching is applied to locate failure areas in the models.

Result: Generative models like LLaVA 1.5 and QwenVLchat perform poorly with low SCS and high IAR, while contrastive models (CLIP, SigLIP) are robust.

Conclusion: Generative VLMs struggle in rejecting visually contradicted statements, while contrastive encoders perform better. Activation patching provides insights for model improvements.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are improving quickly, but standard benchmarks
can hide systematic failures that reduce real world trust. We introduce MATS
(Multimodal Audit for Truthful Spatialization), a compact behavioral audit that
measures whether models reject visually contradicted statements, and two
metrics Spatial Consistency Score (SCS) and Incorrect Agreement Rate (IAR).
Instruction tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) exhibit very low SCS
and high IAR, while contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP) are far more robust.
Activation patching causally localizes failure loci (mid to late cross
attention for generative models, pooled projection components for contrastive
models) and suggests concrete repair paths.

*Shinji Yamashita,Yuma Kinoshita,Hitoshi Kiya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents an efficient algorithm for joint scale and rotation estimation in image alignment, offering sub-pixel precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image alignment is crucial in domains like medical imaging and computer vision for spatially registering images, but existing techniques struggle with scale and rotation changes.

Method: A novel algorithm integrating Fourier transform in log-polar coordinates with sub-pixel-level cross-correlation maximization using the auxiliary function method.

Result: The algorithm achieves lower mean estimation errors in scale and rotation compared to conventional Fourier transform-based discrete cross-correlation methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances the accuracy of scale and rotation estimation, addressing limitations of traditional phase-correlation techniques.

Abstract: This paper introduces a highly efficient algorithm capable of jointly
estimating scale and rotation between two images with sub-pixel precision.
Image alignment serves as a critical process for spatially registering images
captured from different viewpoints, and finds extensive use in domains such as
medical imaging and computer vision. Traditional phase-correlation techniques
are effective in determining translational shifts; however, they are inadequate
when addressing scale and rotation changes, which often arise due to camera
zooming or rotational movements. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm
that integrates scale and rotation estimation based on the Fourier transform in
log-polar coordinates with a cross-correlation maximization strategy,
leveraging the auxiliary function method. By incorporating sub-pixel-level
cross-correlation our method enables precise estimation of both scale and
rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
lower mean estimation errors for scale and rotation than conventional Fourier
transform-based techniques that rely on discrete cross-correlation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs excel in vision-language tasks but face challenges with structured perception, requiring a solution for precise localization and robustness.

Method: The approach uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) enhanced with curriculum-based data scheduling and difficulty-aware filtering to stabilize optimization and adapt progressively to complex tasks.

Result: Significant gains in detection accuracy and robustness are demonstrated in autonomous driving benchmarks, along with ablation studies validating the framework's critical elements.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning optimization with structured curricula is a scalable method for building robust and interpretable perception systems in multimodal domains.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language reasoning
but often struggle with structured perception tasks requiring precise
localization and robustness. We propose a reinforcement learning framework that
augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with curriculum-based data
scheduling and difficulty-aware filtering. This approach stabilizes
optimization under sparse, noisy rewards and enables progressive adaptation to
complex samples. Evaluations on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in detection accuracy and robustness. Ablation studies
confirm the importance of reward design, KL regularization, and curriculum
pacing for convergence stability and generalization. Our findings highlight
reinforcement-driven optimization with structured data curricula as a scalable
path toward robust and interpretable multimodal detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Topology Graph Consistency (TGC) to address shortcomings in Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation (SSSS), achieving state-of-the-art results by incorporating graph-theoretic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense annotations required for semantic segmentation in computational pathology are expensive and limited, necessitating semi-supervised approaches.

Method: The TGC framework incorporates graph-theoretic constraints such as aligning Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency statistics between prediction graphs and references.

Result: Experiments on datasets like GlaS and CRAG show that TGC achieves state-of-the-art performance with 5-10% supervision, significantly closing the gap to fully supervised models.

Conclusion: Integrating graph-theoretic constraints improves the global topology and segmentation accuracy of semi-supervised models in computational pathology.

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) is vital in computational
pathology, where dense annotations are costly and limited. Existing methods
often rely on pixel-level consistency, which propagates noisy pseudo-labels and
produces fragmented or topologically invalid masks. We propose Topology Graph
Consistency (TGC), a framework that integrates graph-theoretic constraints by
aligning Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency statistics between
prediction graphs and references. This enforces global topology and improves
segmentation accuracy. Experiments on GlaS and CRAG demonstrate that TGC
achieves state-of-the-art performance under 5-10% supervision and significantly
narrows the gap to full supervision. Code is available at

*Andrea Asperti,Salvatore Fiorilla,Simone Nardi,Lorenzo Orsini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper surveys advancements in supervised and unsupervised person re-identification (ReID) techniques, highlighting gaps and progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address scalability challenges in supervised person re-ID methods and assess trends in unsupervised techniques.

Method: A literature review and categorization of both supervised and unsupervised person ReID methodologies.

Result: The study identifies limited scope for improvement in supervised methods and highlights promising results and convergence trends in unsupervised ReID.

Conclusion: Supervised person ReID has reached maturity, while unsupervised techniques are narrowing the performance gap, indicating potential future dominance.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReId), a crucial task in surveillance, involves
matching individuals across different camera views. The advent of Deep
Learning, especially supervised techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks
and Attention Mechanisms, has significantly enhanced person Re-ID. However, the
success of supervised approaches hinges on vast amounts of annotated data,
posing scalability challenges in data labeling and computational costs. To
address these limitations, recent research has shifted towards unsupervised
person re-identification. Leveraging abundant unlabeled data, unsupervised
methods aim to overcome the need for pairwise labelled data. Although
traditionally trailing behind supervised approaches, unsupervised techniques
have shown promising developments in recent years, signalling a narrowing
performance gap. Motivated by this evolving landscape, our survey pursues two
primary objectives. First, we review and categorize significant publications in
supervised person re-identification, providing an in-depth overview of the
current state-of-the-art and emphasizing little room for further improvement in
this domain. Second, we explore the latest advancements in unsupervised person
re-identification over the past three years, offering insights into emerging
trends and shedding light on the potential convergence of performance between
supervised and unsupervised paradigms. This dual-focus survey aims to
contribute to the evolving narrative of person re-identification, capturing
both the mature landscape of supervised techniques and the promising outcomes
in the realm of unsupervised learning.

*Yan Wen,Peng Ye,Lin Zhang,Baopu Li,Jiakang Yuan,Yaoxin Yang,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies token efficiency limitations in Vision Mambas (ViMs) and proposes Sequential Token Merging (STM) to optimize token usage without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mambas excel in complex tasks but are limited by inefficiency in token scaling, motivating the need for improved methodologies to address LDSD and selective scanning challenges.

Method: The proposed STM includes bidirectional nearest neighbor merging for spatial aggregation and hidden states protection to stabilize class-token information, leveraging ViMs' layer-wise loss properties.

Result: STM achieves high efficiency, reducing tokens by up to 40% with minimal accuracy degradation; 1.0% accuracy drop for 20% reduction in ViM-Ti, and 1.4% drop for 40% reduction in ViM-S.

Conclusion: STM offers state-of-the-art efficiency with minimal complexity in Vision Mambas, presenting meaningful advancements in token optimization and state-space model understanding.

Abstract: Vision Mambas (ViMs) achieve remarkable success with sub-quadratic
complexity, but their efficiency remains constrained by quadratic token scaling
with image resolution. While existing methods address token redundancy, they
overlook ViMs' intrinsic Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD) - a
critical information flow mechanism revealed in our analysis. We further
identify Mamba's selective scan enables gradual information aggregation in
hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose Sequential Token Merging
(STM), featuring: 1) Bidirectional nearest neighbor merging to preserve
sequential dependencies through symmetric spatial aggregation, and 2) Hidden
states protection to stabilize the hidden states around the class token. STM
strategically leverages Mamba's layer-wise loss convergence to convert temporal
forgetfulness into stability. Experiments demonstrate STM's superiority: 1.0%
accuracy drop for ViM-Ti at 20% token reduction, and only 1.4% degradation for
ViM-S at 40% reduction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art efficiency with
minimal complexity, while providing new insights into state-space model
dynamics. Codes will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive review of super-resolution techniques, focusing on diverse methods like SISR, VSR, SSR, and LFSR, covering over 250 methods and analyzing their methodologies and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of a comprehensive overview in the super-resolution field as existing surveys focus on specific domains.

Method: The authors review over 250 super-resolution methods, conduct a taxonomy based on backbone structure, and analyze datasets, results, and open issues.

Result: The paper organizes and summarizes various SR methods and highlights less-explored issues in the field, along with providing access to a dedicated repository.

Conclusion: The review serves as a valuable resource, offering guidance and insights for researchers interested in super-resolution techniques.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) has garnered significant attention within the computer
vision community, driven by advances in deep learning (DL) techniques and the
growing demand for high-quality visual applications. With the expansion of this
field, numerous surveys have emerged. Most existing surveys focus on specific
domains, lacking a comprehensive overview of this field. Here, we present an
in-depth review of diverse SR methods, encompassing single image
super-resolution (SISR), video super-resolution (VSR), stereo super-resolution
(SSR), and light field super-resolution (LFSR). We extensively cover over 150
SISR methods, nearly 70 VSR approaches, and approximately 30 techniques for SSR
and LFSR. We analyze methodologies, datasets, evaluation protocols, empirical
results, and complexity. In addition, we conducted a taxonomy based on each
backbone structure according to the diverse purposes. We also explore valuable
yet under-studied open issues in the field. We believe that this work will
serve as a valuable resource and offer guidance to researchers in this domain.
To facilitate access to related work, we created a dedicated repository

### [348] [Learning Hyperspectral Images with Curated Text Prompts for Efficient Multimodal Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22697)
*Abhiroop Chatterjee,Susmita Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an optimized Vision-Language Model (VLM) using a CLIP-style contrastive training framework for hyperspectral image (HSI) scene understanding and achieves state-of-the-art results with minimal parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of processing high-dimensional hyperspectral images (HSI) and align visual and textual modalities effectively, as traditional models optimized for natural images or text lack robustness in cross-modal hyperspectral tasks.

Method: The proposed method utilizes a CLIP-like contrastive framework. It maps voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone onto the latent space of a frozen large embedding model (LEM), aligning vision features with textual token representations through a trainable probe. Contrastive loss using hard and semi-hard negatives enhances alignment, and descriptive prompts anchor HSI embeddings.

Result: The method yields state-of-the-art performance, with improvements of +0.92 OA and +1.60 Kappa on the Indian Pines dataset and +0.69 OA and +0.90 Kappa on Pavia University data. It achieves this with updates to only 0.07% of model parameters, making it significantly more parameter-efficient than baselines like DCTN and SS-TMNet.

Conclusion: By leveraging a minimal update approach and contrastive training, the method demonstrates that effective hyperspectral image understanding can be achieved without scaling model parameters excessively, providing a pathway for efficient cross-modal learning.

Abstract: As data requirements continue to grow, efficient learning increasingly
depends on the curation and distillation of high-value data rather than
brute-force scaling of model sizes. In the case of a hyperspectral image (HSI),
the challenge is amplified by the high-dimensional 3D voxel structure, where
each spatial location is associated with hundreds of contiguous spectral
channels. While vision and language models have been optimized effectively for
natural image or text tasks, their cross-modal alignment in the hyperspectral
domain remains an open and underexplored problem. In this article, we make an
attempt to optimize a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for hyperspectral scene
understanding by exploiting a CLIP-style contrastive training framework. Our
framework maps voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone onto the latent
space of a frozen large embedding model (LEM), where a trainable probe aligns
vision features with the model's textual token representations. The two
modalities are aligned via a contrastive loss restricted to a curated set of
hard (closest wrong classes) and semi-hard (random distractors) negatives,
along with positive pairs. To further enhance alignment, descriptive prompts
that encode class semantics are introduced and act as structured anchors for
the HSI embeddings. It is seen that the proposed method updates only 0.07
percent of the total parameters, yet yields state-of-the-art performance. For
example, on Indian Pines (IP) the model produces better results over unimodal
and multimodal baselines by +0.92 Overall Accuracy (OA) and +1.60 Kappa
($\kappa$), while on Pavia University (PU) data it provides gains of +0.69 OA
and +0.90 $\kappa$. Moreover, this is achieved with the set of parameters,
nearly 50$\times$ smaller than DCTN and 90$\times$ smaller than SS-TMNet.

*Zhuang Qi,Pan Yu,Lei Meng,Sijin Zhou,Han Yu,Xiaoxiao Li,Xiangxu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GPR-NIAM, a method for one-shot Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) that enables efficient collaboration and generalization across tasks using innovative embedding masking and cross-silo refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Federated Prompt Learning methods require multi-round communication to exhibit their strengths, and one-shot methods lack generalization across tasks, presenting challenges for efficient and collaborative adaptation.

Method: The GPR-NIAM approach employs an attention isolation module to manage interaction between original text and prompt embeddings, alongside a cross-silo collaborative refinement module that aligns multi-source visual knowledge to enhance the global prompt.

Result: Experiments on ten benchmark datasets show that GPR-NIAM surpasses eight state-of-the-art methods in both class-level and domain-level task generalization.

Conclusion: GPR-NIAM provides an effective solution for one-shot Federated Prompt Learning, enhancing communication efficiency, cross-task generalization, and mitigating issues caused by data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) enables communication-efficient adaptation by
tuning lightweight prompts on top of frozen pre-trained models. Existing FPL
methods typically rely on global information, which is only available after the
second training round, to facilitate collaboration among client models.
Therefore, they are inherently dependent on multi-round communication to fully
exhibit their strengths. Moreover, existing one-shot federated learning methods
typically focus on fitting seen tasks, but lack cross-task generalization. To
bridge this gap, we propose the Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering
Attention Masking (GPR-NIAM) method for one-shot FPL. The core idea is to
design a masking mechanism that restricts excessive interaction between the
original text embeddings and the learnable prompt embeddings. GPR-NIAM achieves
this through the collaboration of two key modules. Firstly, the attention
isolation module suppresses attention from the learnable prompt tokens to the
original text tokens, and reweights the reverse attention which preserves
generalization across tasks. Secondly, the cross-silo collaborative refinement
module integrates decentralized visual knowledge into a unified base and
calibrates the global prompt through multi-source cross-modal knowledge
alignment, further mitigating the inconsistency caused by data heterogeneity.
Extensive experiments conducted on ten benchmark datasets under two tasks show
that GPR-NIAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in both class-level
and domain-level generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of semantic segmentation in 3D environments when training data for all object classes is unavailable, particularly in Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) environments.

Method: The authors incorporate Mixture-of-Experts into the Generator and Discriminator components of a GZSL model. They utilize a pre-trained KPConv model on seen classes to produce realistic synthesized features.

Result: The proposed GZSL-MoE model demonstrates improved performance on both seen and unseen classes when applied to the COVERED dataset.

Conclusion: GZSL-MoE offers an effective approach for handling complex 3D environments in scenarios with incomplete training data, showcasing its potential in advancing semantic understanding for HRC.

Abstract: Generative Zero-Shot Learning approach (GZSL) has demonstrated significant
potential in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation tasks. GZSL leverages
generative models like GANs or VAEs to synthesize realistic features (real
features) of unseen classes. This allows the model to label unseen classes
during testing, despite being trained only on seen classes. In this context, we
introduce the Generalized Zero-Shot Learning based-upon Mixture-of-Experts
(GZSL-MoE) model. This model incorporates Mixture-of-Experts layers (MoE) to
generate fake features that closely resemble real features extracted using a
pre-trained KPConv (Kernel Point Convolution) model on seen classes. The main
contribution of this paper is the integration of Mixture-of-Experts into the
Generator and Discriminator components of the Generative Zero-Shot Learning
model for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, applied to the COVERED dataset
(CollabOratiVE Robot Environment Dataset) for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC)
environments. By combining the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model with
Mixture-of- Experts, GZSL-MoE for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation provides
a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments, especially when
comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable. The
performance evaluation of the GZSL-MoE model highlights its ability to enhance
performance on both seen and unseen classes. Keywords Generalized Zero-Shot

TL;DR: This paper introduces Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT), which address the lack of inductive biases in Transformers by using learned masks, enabling them to perform well on small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer architectures excel in scaling with dataset size and explainability but struggle on small datasets due to the lack of inductive biases present in Convolutional Neural Networks.

Method: The authors incorporate inductive biases into Vision Transformers using learned masks, avoiding the need for Knowledge Distillation and allowing the model to learn better from small datasets.

Result: The proposed IBiT approach demonstrated improved accuracy on small datasets compared to standard Vision Transformers, while maintaining their explainability.

Conclusion: IBiT successfully combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks' inductive biases with the scaling and explainable advantages of Transformers, making them suitable for small dataset learning.

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer-based architectures have become the dominant
method for Computer Vision applications. While Transformers are explainable and
scale well with dataset size, they lack the inductive biases of Convolutional
Neural Networks. While these biases may be learned on large datasets, we show
that introducing these inductive biases through learned masks allow Vision
Transformers to learn on much smaller datasets without Knowledge Distillation.
These Transformers, which we call Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT),
are significantly more accurate on small datasets, while retaining the
explainability Transformers.

*Zezhong Fan,Xiaohan Li,Luyi Ma,Kai Zhao,Liang Peng,Topojoy Biswas,Evren Korpeoglu,Kaushiki Nag,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LayoutAgent, a framework that combines vision-language reasoning with diffusion models for generating realistic and semantically coherent multi-object scene layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to generate scenes with realistic spatial layouts that integrate semantic richness, overcoming limitations of image diffusion models and traditional spatial planning methods.

Method: LayoutAgent processes inputs using vision-language models for segmentation and scene graph construction, employs compositional diffusion for layout generation based on object relations, and uses a foreground-conditioned image generator for rendering the complete scene.

Result: LayoutAgent achieves improved layout coherence, spatial realism, and aesthetic alignment compared to state-of-the-art layout generation models.

Conclusion: The proposed LayoutAgent effectively bridges the gap between visual-language reasoning and spatial layout synthesis, offering advancements in multi-object scene planning.

Abstract: Designing realistic multi-object scenes requires not only generating images,
but also planning spatial layouts that respect semantic relations and physical
plausibility. On one hand, while recent advances in diffusion models have
enabled high-quality image generation, they lack explicit spatial reasoning,
leading to unrealistic object layouts. On the other hand, traditional spatial
planning methods in robotics emphasize geometric and relational consistency,
but they struggle to capture semantic richness in visual scenes. To bridge this
gap, in this paper, we propose LayoutAgent, an agentic framework that unifies
vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for layout generation.
Given multiple input images with target objects in them, our method first
employs visual-language model to preprocess the inputs through segmentation,
object size estimation, scene graph construction, and prompt rewriting. Then we
leverage compositional diffusion-a method traditionally used in robotics-to
synthesize bounding boxes that respect object relations encoded in the scene
graph for spatial layouts. In the end, a foreground-conditioned image generator
composes the complete scene by rendering the objects into the planned layout
guided by designed prompts. Experiments demonstrate that LayoutAgent
outperforms other state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout
coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in evaluating visual comparison reasoning skills in VLMs, a fundamental capability that is underexplored.

Method: The benchmark consists of 1000 QA pairs across four tasks derived from newly created datasets, TallyBench and HistCaps. Both closed-source and open-source VLMs were tested and examined for their reasoning abilities.

Result: Key results highlight scaling benefits but also significant weaknesses in VLM performance, such as difficulty with temporal ordering, spatial relations, and basic counting, which are simple for humans.

Conclusion: Visual comparison remains a major limitation in current VLMs, and CompareBench provides a valuable tool to diagnose and advance this multimodal capability.

Abstract: We introduce CompareBench, a benchmark for evaluating visual comparison
reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), a fundamental yet understudied
skill. CompareBench consists of 1000 QA pairs across four tasks: quantity
(600), temporal (100), geometric (200), and spatial (100). It is derived from
two auxiliary datasets that we constructed: TallyBench (2000 counting images
with QA) and HistCaps (515 historical images with bilingual captions). We
evaluate both closed-source APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and open-source
models (Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series). Results show clear scaling trends but
also reveal critical limitations: even the strongest models consistently fail
at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and they often make mistakes in
basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans. These
findings demonstrate that visual comparison remains a systematic blind spot for
current VLMs. By providing controlled, diverse, and diagnostic evaluation,
CompareBench establishes a foundation for advancing more reliable multimodal
reasoning.

### [354] [MILR: Improving Multimodal Image Generation via Test-Time Latent Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22761)
*Yapeng Mi,Hengli Li,Yanpeng Zhao,Chenxi Li,Huimin Wu,Xiaojian Ma,Song-Chun Zhu,Ying Nian Wu,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MILR is a test-time method that carries out joint reasoning over image and text in a unified latent space, achieving state-of-the-art performance on reasoning-intensive image generation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning-based image generation systems are limited by either single-modality constraints or the need for fine-tuning with high-quality reasoning data, necessitating a more flexible, multimodal reasoning approach.

Method: MILR performs reasoning via a search through vector representations of image and text tokens in a unified latent space, implemented using the policy gradient method and guided by an image quality critic. The method integrates with the MUG framework for cross-modal reasoning entirely at test time.

Result: MILR achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE, with an 80% improvement over the baseline on the knowledge-intensive WISE dataset.

Conclusion: Joint reasoning in a unified latent space underpins MILR's superior performance, and its ability to perform non-trivial temporal and cultural reasoning highlights its broader efficacy.

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented machine learning systems have shown improved performance
in various domains, including image generation. However, existing
reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a
single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for
fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method
that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space.
Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of
discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy
gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within
the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that
natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus
facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to
be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate
entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE,
achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on
knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over
the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the
unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our
qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural
reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method.

*Tangqi Shi,Pietro Lio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces UESA-Net, a U-shaped network leveraging multidirectional attention and shrinkage strategies to improve breast and thyroid ultrasound image segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges posed by speckle noise, overlapping structures, and weak global-local feature interactions in ultrasound imaging. Current methods struggle to balance high-level semantic understanding with low-level spatial detail.

Method: UESA-Net, a novel U-shaped network, uses multidirectional shrinkage attention in encoder-decoder architectures. Attention modules focus on horizontal, vertical, and depth directions, while a shrinkage strategy integrates prior knowledge. The decoder incorporates pairwise shrinkage to enhance context modeling.

Result: UESA-Net significantly outperformed existing methods on public datasets TN3K and BUSI, achieving IoU scores of 0.8487 and 0.6495, respectively.

Conclusion: UESA-Net demonstrates its effectiveness in robustly and accurately segmenting ultrasound images of breast and thyroid lesions, outperforming existing networks on multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Background: Breast and thyroid cancers pose an increasing public-health
burden. Ultrasound imaging is a cost-effective, real-time modality for lesion
detection and segmentation, yet suffers from speckle noise, overlapping
structures, and weak global-local feature interactions. Existing networks
struggle to reconcile high-level semantics with low-level spatial details. We
aim to develop a segmentation framework that bridges the semantic gap between
global context and local detail in noisy ultrasound images.
  Methods: We propose UESA-Net, a U-shaped network with multidirectional
shrinkage attention. The encoder-decoder architecture captures long-range
dependencies and fine-grained structures of lesions. Within each encoding
block, attention modules operate along horizontal, vertical, and depth
directions to exploit spatial details, while a shrinkage (threshold) strategy
integrates prior knowledge and local features. The decoder mirrors the encoder
but applies a pairwise shrinkage mechanism, combining prior low-level physical
cues with corresponding encoder features to enhance context modeling.
  Results: On two public datasets - TN3K (3493 images) and BUSI (780 images) -
UESA-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance with intersection-over-union
(IoU) scores of 0.8487 and 0.6495, respectively.
  Conclusions: UESA-Net effectively aggregates multidirectional spatial
information and prior knowledge to improve robustness and accuracy in breast
and thyroid ultrasound segmentation, demonstrating superior performance to
existing methods on multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: PartCo enhances Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) by introducing part-level visual feature correspondences, improving semantic understanding and setting new benchmarks in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GCD approaches struggle with distinguishing closely related categories due to relying on global image representations and overlooking part-level cues.

Method: PartCo leverages part-level visual feature correspondences to capture finer semantic structures. It operates as an augmentation to existing GCD methods without significant modifications.

Result: Experiments across benchmark datasets showed PartCo achieved significant performance improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art results in GCD.

Conclusion: PartCo bridges semantic labels with detailed visual compositions, demonstrating its ability to improve category discovery and define new standards for future GCD methods.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify both known and novel
categories within unlabeled data by leveraging a set of labeled examples from
known categories. Existing GCD methods primarily depend on semantic labels and
global image representations, often overlooking the detailed part-level cues
that are crucial for distinguishing closely related categories. In this paper,
we introduce PartCo, short for Part-Level Correspondence Prior, a novel
framework that enhances category discovery by incorporating part-level visual
feature correspondences. By leveraging part-level relationships, PartCo
captures finer-grained semantic structures, enabling a more nuanced
understanding of category relationships. Importantly, PartCo seamlessly
integrates with existing GCD methods without requiring significant
modifications. Our extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that PartCo significantly improves the performance of current GCD
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results by bridging the gap between
semantic labels and part-level visual compositions, thereby setting new
benchmarks for GCD. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/partco

*Komal Kumar,Rao Muhammad Anwer,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Salman Khan,Ivan Laptev,Hisham Cholakkal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DEFT, a framework for efficient fine-tuning of Text-to-Image models, focusing on finer parameter tuning via low-rank decomposition to enhance task performance while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning pre-trained Text-to-Image models efficiently while balancing computational costs, personalization capabilities, instruction-following ability, and model editability remains challenging.

Method: DEFT fine-tunes models by decomposing weight updates into two low-rank components: one projecting onto a complementary subspace and another for adapting parameters flexibly within the subspace.

Result: Extensive experiments on datasets, including Dreambooth, Dreambench Plus, InsDet, and VisualCloze, show that DEFT achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: DEFT offers a computationally efficient and parameter-adaptive solution for fine-tuning Text-to-Image models, demonstrating its effectiveness for tasks like personalization, object/scene adaptation, and visual in-context learning.

Abstract: Efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) models involves
adjusting the model to suit a particular task or dataset while minimizing
computational resources and limiting the number of trainable parameters.
However, it often faces challenges in striking a trade-off between aligning
with the target distribution: learning a novel concept from a limited image for
personalization and retaining the instruction ability needed for unifying
multiple tasks, all while maintaining editability (aligning with a variety of
prompts or in-context generation). In this work, we introduce DEFT,
Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning, an efficient fine-tuning framework that
adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by decomposing its update into two
components with two trainable matrices: (1) a projection onto the complement of
a low-rank subspace spanned by a low-rank matrix, and (2) a low-rank update.
The single trainable low-rank matrix defines the subspace, while the other
trainable low-rank matrix enables flexible parameter adaptation within that
subspace. We conducted extensive experiments on the Dreambooth and Dreambench
Plus datasets for personalization, the InsDet dataset for object and scene
adaptation, and the VisualCloze dataset for a universal image generation
framework through visual in-context learning with both Stable Diffusion and a
unified model. Our results demonstrated state-of-the-art performance,
highlighting the emergent properties of efficient fine-tuning. Our code is

TL;DR: This paper introduces VideoScore2, a human-aligned evaluation framework for text-to-video generation, designed to assess video quality using multi-dimensional metrics and provide interpretable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses challenges in evaluating text-to-video generation, including the limitations of existing evaluation tools that produce singular, opaque scores lacking comprehensiveness and interpretability.

Method: VideoScore2 employs a two-stage training pipeline involving supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), utilizing a large dataset of human-annotated videos to analyze multiple dimensions of video quality.

Result: Experiments show VideoScore2 achieves higher accuracy on in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance along with interpretable results that enable better reward modeling.

Conclusion: VideoScore2 enhances video evaluation by providing detailed, human-aligned assessments, improving the link between evaluation metrics and controllable video generation processes.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced increasingly
realistic and diverse content, yet evaluating such videos remains a fundamental
challenge due to their multi-faceted nature encompassing visual quality,
semantic alignment, and physical consistency. Existing evaluators and reward
models are limited to single opaque scores, lack interpretability, or provide
only coarse analysis, making them insufficient for capturing the comprehensive
nature of video quality assessment. We present VideoScore2, a
multi-dimensional, interpretable, and human-aligned framework that explicitly
evaluates visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical/common-sense
consistency while producing detailed chain-of-thought rationales. Our model is
trained on a large-scale dataset VideoFeedback2 containing 27,168
human-annotated videos with both scores and reasoning traces across three
dimensions, using a two-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
enhance analytical robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoScore2 achieves superior performance with 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on our
in-domain benchmark VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance
across four out-of-domain benchmarks (VideoGenReward-Bench, VideoPhy2, etc),
while providing interpretable assessments that bridge the gap between
evaluation and controllable generation through effective reward modeling for
Best-of-N sampling. Project Page: https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/VideoScore2/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses distribution shift issues in State Space Models (SSMs) for vision tasks by introducing TRUST, a test-time adaptation (TTA) method leveraging SSM-specific traversal properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSMs like VMamba show promise as alternatives to Vision Transformers in vision tasks but struggle with distribution shifts, necessitating an improvement in their generalization performance.

Method: TRUST generates multiple causal perspectives via traversal permutations, uses model predictions as pseudo-labels for parameter updates, and averages adapted weights to combine learned information.

Result: TRUST demonstrated consistent improvements in robustness and outperformed existing TTA methods across seven benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: TRUST effectively leverages SSM-specific architectural properties for adaptation, enhancing robustness against distribution shifts and showcasing the potential of tailored test-time strategies.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with VMamba standing out as a pioneering architecture
designed for vision tasks. However, their generalization performance degrades
significantly under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we propose
TRUST (Test-Time Refinement using Uncertainty-Guided SSM Traverses), a novel
test-time adaptation (TTA) method that leverages diverse traversal permutations
to generate multiple causal perspectives of the input image. Model predictions
serve as pseudo-labels to guide updates of the Mamba-specific parameters, and
the adapted weights are averaged to integrate the learned information across
traversal scans. Altogether, TRUST is the first approach that explicitly
leverages the unique architectural properties of SSMs for adaptation.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that TRUST consistently improves
robustness and outperforms existing TTA methods.

TL;DR: The paper presents MMPB, the first benchmark for testing the personalization capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), revealing significant challenges in adapting to user-specific concepts and maintaining dialogue consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored area of how Vision-Language Models can adapt to individual users for personalized AI applications.

Method: The authors evaluate 23 VLMs against MMPB's benchmark through a three-stage protocol involving concept injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying.

Result: Most existing VLMs struggle with personalization tasks such as dialogue consistency, handling preferences, and visual cue adaptation, revealing key limitations like refusal behaviors and long-context forgetting.

Conclusion: MMPB provides a foundational benchmark for future research aimed at developing truly personalized multi-modal AI systems and highlights substantial improvement areas for current VLMs.

Abstract: Visual personalization is essential in user-facing AI systems such as smart
homes and healthcare, where aligning model behavior with user-centric concepts
is critical. However, recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), despite their
broad applicability, remain underexplored in their ability to adapt to
individual users. In this paper, we introduce MMPB, the first extensive
benchmark for evaluating VLMs on personalization. MMPB comprises 10k
image-query pairs and includes 111 personalizable concepts across four
categories: humans, animals, objects, and characters, with the human category
enriched with preference-grounded queries. We structure personalization into
three main task types, each highlighting a different key property of VLMs.
Using 23 widely used VLMs including both open- and closed-source models, we
evaluate personalization performance via a three-stage protocol: concept
injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying. Our findings
indicate that most VLMs (including some closed-source models) struggle with
personalization, particularly in maintaining consistency over dialogue,
handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Our analysis reveals
that the challenges in VLM personalization (such as refusal behaviors and
long-context forgetting) highlight substantial room for improvement. By
identifying these limitations and offering a scalable benchmark, MMPB offers
valuable insights and a solid foundation for future research toward truly
personalized multi-modal AI. Project Page: aidaslab.github.io/MMPB

*Roie Kazoom,Alon Goldberg,Hodaya Cohen,Ofer Hadar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework for adversarial patch attacks that achieves both high attack performance and visual realism, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial patch attacks rely on unrealistic assumptions or produce conspicuous patches, limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: The method combines a generative U-Net design with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement to localize patches semantically, maximizing effectiveness and preserving realism.

Result: Extensive experiments show success rates exceeding 99% across various architectures like DenseNet-121, ResNet-50, ViT-B/16, and Swin-B/16.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability, setting a new standard for adversarial robustness research.

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a severe threat to deep neural networks, yet
most existing approaches rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, untargeted
objectives, or produce visually conspicuous patches that limit real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for fully
controllable adversarial patch generation, where the attacker can freely choose
both the input image x and the target class y target, thereby dictating the
exact misclassification outcome. Our method combines a generative U-Net design
with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement, enabling semantic-aware localization that
maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism. Extensive
experiments across convolutional networks (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50) and vision
transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16, among others) demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across all settings, with attack success
rates (ASR) and target-class success (TCS) consistently exceeding 99%.
  Importantly, we show that our method not only outperforms prior white-box
attacks and untargeted baselines, but also surpasses existing non-realistic
approaches that produce detectable artifacts. By simultaneously ensuring
realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability-the three most
challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks-our framework establishes a new
benchmark for adversarial robustness research, bridging the gap between
theoretical attack strength and practical stealthiness.

*Ibrahim Delibasoglu,Fredrik Heintz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrossScaleNet integrates a patch-based cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing for superior forecasting performance and intrinsic temporal saliency explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance the explainability in time series forecasting while maintaining high predictive accuracy.

Method: CrossScaleNet utilizes attention mechanisms embedded in training, combining patch-based cross-attention and multi-scale architecture for intrinsic saliency detection.

Result: Validations on synthetic, public, and real-world datasets show CrossScaleNet outperforms transformer-based models in temporal saliency explainability and forecasting accuracy.

Conclusion: CrossScaleNet achieves a balance of state-of-the-art forecasting performance and improved explainability, addressing gaps in existing models for time series forecasting.

Abstract: Explainability in time series forecasting is essential for improving model
transparency and supporting informed decision-making. In this work, we present
CrossScaleNet, an innovative architecture that combines a patch-based
cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing to achieve both high
performance and enhanced temporal explainability. By embedding attention
mechanisms into the training process, our model provides intrinsic
explainability for temporal saliency, making its decision-making process more
transparent. Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are
computationally expensive, particularly when compared to feature importance
detection. While ablation techniques may suffice for datasets with fewer
features, identifying temporal saliency poses greater challenges due to its
complexity. We validate CrossScaleNet on synthetic datasets with known saliency
ground truth and on established public benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness
of our method in identifying temporal saliency. Experiments on real-world
datasets for forecasting task show that our approach consistently outperforms
most transformer-based models, offering better explainability without
sacrificing predictive accuracy. Our evaluations demonstrate superior
performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy.
Moreover, we highlight that existing models claiming explainability often fail
to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks. CrossScaleNet addresses
this gap, offering a balanced approach that captures temporal saliency
effectively while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance across
datasets of varying complexity.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a transfer learning-based method combined with advanced multimodal techniques to improve IGTV segmentation for lung cancer PET/CT imaging, achieving a Dice score of 0.609.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately delineating internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) in PET/CT imaging is crucial for effective radiation therapy in lung cancer but is hindered by limited datasets and weak PET signal intensities at tumor boundaries.

Method: The authors use a multimodal interactive perception network pre-trained on large gross tumor volume (GTV) datasets, fine-tuned on a private IGTV dataset. They enhance segmentation with a slice interaction module integrated into a 2.5D framework to model inter-slice relationships.

Result: The proposed framework significantly improves segmentation performance, achieving a Dice score of 0.609 compared to the baseline score of 0.385.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that transfer learning combined with multimodal techniques and an innovative slice interaction module can improve IGTV segmentation, with implications for better radiation therapy planning for lung cancer.

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancerrelated deaths globally.
Accurate delineation of internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) in PET/CT imaging is
pivotal for optimal radiation therapy in mobile tumors such as lung cancer to
account for tumor motion, yet is hindered by the limited availability of
annotated IGTV datasets and attenuated PET signal intensity at tumor
boundaries. In this study, we present a transfer learningbased methodology
utilizing a multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA, pre-trained
on extensive gross tumor volume (GTV) datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on a
private IGTV cohort. This cohort constitutes the PET/CT subset of the
Lung-cancer Unified Cross-modal Imaging Dataset (LUCID). To further address the
challenge of weak PET intensities in IGTV peripheral slices, we introduce a
slice interaction module (SIM) within a 2.5D segmentation framework to
effectively model inter-slice relationships. Our proposed module integrates
channel and spatial attention branches with depthwise convolutions, enabling
more robust learning of slice-to-slice dependencies and thereby improving
overall segmentation performance. A comprehensive experimental evaluation
demonstrates that our approach achieves a Dice of 0.609 on the private IGTV
dataset, substantially surpassing the conventional baseline score of 0.385.
This work highlights the potential of transfer learning, coupled with advanced
multimodal techniques and a SIM to enhance the reliability and clinical
relevance of IGTV segmentation for lung cancer radiation therapy planning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ControlEvents, a diffusion-based generative model for creating high-quality event camera data guided by various inputs, reducing the need for extensive labeled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of obtaining large-scale labeled ground-truth data for event-based vision tasks, despite the advantages of event cameras like high temporal resolution and dynamic range.

Method: The authors developed ControlEvents, which utilizes diffusion priors from foundational models, such as Stable Diffusion, to generate event camera data using minimal fine-tuning and limited labeled data. The model supports various control signals like text labels, 2D skeletons, and 3D body poses.

Result: ControlEvents successfully synthesized event camera data, improving model performance in visual recognition, 2D skeleton estimation, and 3D body pose estimation. The model also supported text-based generation for unseen labels during training.

Conclusion: The approach significantly enhances the generation of labeled event datasets, reducing costs and demonstrating adaptability through various control inputs, making it a valuable asset for event-based vision tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, event cameras have gained significant attention due to their
bio-inspired properties, such as high temporal resolution and high dynamic
range. However, obtaining large-scale labeled ground-truth data for event-based
vision tasks remains challenging and costly. In this paper, we present
ControlEvents, a diffusion-based generative model designed to synthesize
high-quality event data guided by diverse control signals such as class text
labels, 2D skeletons, and 3D body poses. Our key insight is to leverage the
diffusion prior from foundation models, such as Stable Diffusion, enabling
high-quality event data generation with minimal fine-tuning and limited labeled
data. Our method streamlines the data generation process and significantly
reduces the cost of producing labeled event datasets. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach by synthesizing event data for visual
recognition, 2D skeleton estimation, and 3D body pose estimation. Our
experiments show that the synthesized labeled event data enhances model
performance in all tasks. Additionally, our approach can generate events based
on unseen text labels during training, illustrating the powerful text-based
generation capabilities inherited from foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into implicit neural representations (INRs) for deformable image registration, improving accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency across organs and modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of learning-based deformable image registration methods, which require large datasets and often fail to surpass iterative approaches in precision, proposing a framework that enhances INR-based registration methods.

Method: KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR employ Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) integrated with INRs, alongside a randomized basis sampling strategy to reduce computational costs while maintaining high registration quality across multiple datasets.

Result: The proposed methods showed superior accuracy compared to other INR-based methods and achieved stable learning across random seeds, demonstrating their effectiveness in registration tasks for lung CT, brain MRI, and cardiac MRI datasets.

Conclusion: KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR represent significant advancements in INR-based deformable image registration, providing improved accuracy, computational efficiency, and learning stability, with RandKAN-IDIR further simplifying training complexities.

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a cornerstone of medical image
analysis, enabling spatial alignment for tasks like comparative studies and
multi-modal fusion. While learning-based methods (e.g., CNNs, transformers)
offer fast inference, they often require large training datasets and struggle
to match the precision of classical iterative approaches on some organ types
and imaging modalities. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as
a promising alternative, parameterizing deformations as continuous mappings
from coordinates to displacement vectors. However, this comes at the cost of
requiring instance-specific optimization, making computational efficiency and
seed-dependent learning stability critical factors for these methods. In this
work, we propose KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR, the first integration of
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into deformable image registration with
implicit neural representations (INRs). Our proposed randomized basis sampling
strategy reduces the required number of basis functions in KAN while
maintaining registration quality, thereby significantly lowering computational
costs. We evaluated our approach on three diverse datasets (lung CT, brain MRI,
cardiac MRI) and compared it with competing instance-specific learning-based
approaches, dataset-trained deep learning models, and classical registration
approaches. KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR achieved the highest accuracy among
INR-based methods across all evaluated modalities and anatomies, with minimal
computational overhead and superior learning stability across multiple random
seeds. Additionally, we discovered that our RandKAN-IDIR model with randomized
basis sampling slightly outperforms the model with learnable basis function
indices, while eliminating its additional training-time complexity.

### [366] [Convolutional Set Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22889)
*Federico Chinello,Giacomo Boracchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The Convolutional Set Transformer (CST) is introduced as a neural network designed to process visually heterogeneous image sets directly from 3D image tensors, enabling superior feature extraction and contextual modeling without external embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing set-input networks struggle to handle 3D image tensors directly, requiring cascading with feature extractors. This limitation hinders efficient modeling of inter-image relationships and compatibility with CNN explainability methods.

Method: CST performs joint feature extraction and contextual modeling on 3D image tensors without the need for external embedding extraction networks. It supports Transfer Learning and native compatibility with explainability tools like Grad-CAM.

Result: CST achieves superior performance in Set Classification and Set Anomaly Detection tasks compared to other approaches, while being natively compatible with Grad-CAM for model explainability.

Conclusion: The CST architecture represents a significant advancement for handling and interpreting heterogeneous image sets, combining feature extraction and modeling while enhancing explainability and transferability in diverse domains.

Abstract: We introduce the Convolutional Set Transformer (CST), a novel neural
architecture designed to process image sets of arbitrary cardinality that are
visually heterogeneous yet share high-level semantics - such as a common
category, scene, or concept. Existing set-input networks, e.g., Deep Sets and
Set Transformer, are limited to vector inputs and cannot directly handle 3D
image tensors. As a result, they must be cascaded with a feature extractor,
typically a CNN, which encodes images into embeddings before the set-input
network can model inter-image relationships. In contrast, CST operates directly
on 3D image tensors, performing feature extraction and contextual modeling
simultaneously, thereby enabling synergies between the two processes. This
design yields superior performance in tasks such as Set Classification and Set
Anomaly Detection and further provides native compatibility with CNN
explainability methods such as Grad-CAM, unlike competing approaches that
remain opaque. Finally, we show that CSTs can be pre-trained on large-scale
datasets and subsequently adapted to new domains and tasks through standard
Transfer Learning schemes. To support further research, we release CST-15, a
CST backbone pre-trained on ImageNet
(https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer).

Conclusion: TY-RIST effectively addresses IRSTD challenges, delivers state-of-the-art performance, and enables real-time capability with reduced computational costs.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is critical for defense and
surveillance but remains challenging due to (1) target loss from minimal
features, (2) false alarms in cluttered environments, (3) missed detections
from low saliency, and (4) high computational costs. To address these issues,
we propose TY-RIST, an optimized YOLOv12n architecture that integrates (1) a
stride-aware backbone with fine-grained receptive fields, (2) a high-resolution
detection head, (3) cascaded coordinate attention blocks, and (4) a branch
pruning strategy that reduces computational cost by about 25.5% while
marginally improving accuracy and enabling real-time inference. We also
incorporate the Normalized Gaussian Wasserstein Distance (NWD) to enhance
regression stability. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and across 20
different models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, improving mAP at 0.5
IoU by +7.9%, Precision by +3%, and Recall by +10.2%, while achieving up to 123
FPS on a single GPU. Cross-dataset validation on a fifth dataset further
confirms strong generalization capability. Additional results and resources are

### [368] [Learning Unified Representation of 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22917)
*Yuelin Xin,Yuheng Liu,Xiaohui Xie,Xinke Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new embedding representation for 3D Gaussian Splatting to address challenges with its parameter-based representation in neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the difficulty of learning features using raw Gaussian parameters due to their non-unique and heterogeneous nature, which limits model effectiveness.

Method: The authors propose using continuous submanifold fields to create an embedding representation for 3D Gaussian Splatting that preserves color and geometric structures while ensuring unique mapping and channel homogeneity.

Result: The suggested embedding representation encapsulates intrinsic Gaussian primitive information, enhancing the learning of 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Conclusion: The study contributes a principled approach to improve neural-network-based 3D Gaussian Splatting models by overcoming challenges in parameter representation.

Abstract: A well-designed vectorized representation is crucial for the learning systems
natively based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. While 3DGS enables efficient and
explicit 3D reconstruction, its parameter-based representation remains hard to
learn as features, especially for neural-network-based models. Directly feeding
raw Gaussian parameters into learning frameworks fails to address the
non-unique and heterogeneous nature of the Gaussian parameterization, yielding
highly data-dependent models. This challenge motivates us to explore a more
principled approach to represent 3D Gaussian Splatting in neural networks that
preserves the underlying color and geometric structure while enforcing unique
mapping and channel homogeneity. In this paper, we propose an embedding
representation of 3DGS based on continuous submanifold fields that encapsulate
the intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives, thereby benefiting the
learning of 3DGS.

*Yuanzhi Zhu,Xi Wang,Stéphane Lathuilière,Vicky Kalogeiton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Soft-Di[M]O, a method that introduces soft embeddings to one-step generators distilled from Masked Diffusion Models, allowing for enhanced training flexibility and improved synthesis performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to overcome the limitations of one-step generators, which inherit biases from teacher models and block gradient flow due to discrete token outputs, hindering advanced refining techniques.

Method: The authors introduce soft embeddings as a relaxation technique that replaces discrete token outputs with continuous surrogates, enabling end-to-end trainability and compatibility with advanced refining methods like GAN-based refinement and Test-Time Embedding Optimization.

Result: Soft-Di[M]O achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple benchmarks, including a one-step FID score of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN refinement, and improved scores in text-to-image synthesis with reward fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Integrating soft embeddings into one-step generators effectively addresses existing limitations, offering enhanced differentiation capabilities and achieving superior synthesis results compared to existing methods.

Abstract: One-step generators distilled from Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) compress
multiple sampling steps into a single forward pass, enabling efficient text and
image synthesis. However, they suffer two key limitations: they inherit
modeling bias from the teacher, and their discrete token outputs block gradient
flow, preventing post-distillation refinements such as adversarial training,
reward-based fine-tuning, and Test-Time Embedding Optimization (TTEO). In this
work, we introduce soft embeddings, a simple relaxation that replaces discrete
tokens with the expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution.
Soft embeddings preserve representation fidelity for one-step discrete
generator while providing a fully differentiable continuous surrogate that is
compatible with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders. Integrating soft
embeddings into the Di[M]O distillation framework (denoted Soft-Di[M]O) makes
one-step generators end-to-end trainable and enables straightforward
application of GAN-based refinement, differentiable reward fine-tuning, and
TTEO. Empirically, across multiple MDM teachers (e.g., MaskBit, MaskGen),
Soft-Di[M]O achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image
performance, a one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN-based refinement,
along with higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward
fine-tuning, and further gains from TTEO.

*Chenghan Yang,Peng Zhou,Dong-Sheng Zhang,Yueyun Wang,Hong-Bin Shen,Xiaoyong Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FishAI 2.0 introduces a framework using multimodal few-shot learning and data augmentation to address challenges in marine fish recognition under limited data conditions, achieving high accuracy results at various taxonomic levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marine biological image recognition struggles with limited datasets and low accuracy, especially for rare species, necessitating innovative approaches to improve recognition rates and support ecological monitoring.

Method: The study employs multimodal few-shot deep learning with image augmentation using hierarchical datasets, textual descriptions generated by DeepSeek, and images created via Stable Diffusion 2. Results are processed through a CLIP-based model to enhance few-shot recognition capabilities.

Result: FishAI 2.0 achieved Top-1 accuracy of 91.67% for family-level recognition and 85.42% for species-level recognition, outperforming baseline models and excelling in identifying species with scarce data.

Conclusion: FishAI 2.0 effectively enhances marine fish identification, proving scalable and practical for ecological applications while demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy for rare species.

Abstract: Traditional marine biological image recognition faces challenges of
incomplete datasets and unsatisfactory model accuracy, particularly for
few-shot conditions of rare species where data scarcity significantly hampers
the performance. To address these issues, this study proposes an intelligent
marine fish recognition framework, FishAI 2.0, integrating multimodal few-shot
deep learning techniques with image generation for data augmentation. First, a
hierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, which provides a comprehensive data
foundation for subsequent model training, is utilized to train the FishAI 2.0
model. To address the data scarcity of rare classes, the large language model
DeepSeek was employed to generate high-quality textual descriptions, which are
input into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation through a hierarchical
diffusion strategy that extracts latent encoding to construct a multimodal
feature space. The enhanced visual-textual datasets were then fed into a
Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) based model, enabling robust
few-shot image recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that FishAI 2.0
achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 91.67 percent and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97 percent
at the family level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT models with a
substantial margin for the minority classes with fewer than 10 training
samples. To better apply FishAI 2.0 to real-world scenarios, at the genus and
species level, FishAI 2.0 respectively achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 87.58
percent and 85.42 percent, demonstrating practical utility. In summary, FishAI
2.0 improves the efficiency and accuracy of marine fish identification and
provides a scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and
conservation, highlighting its scientific value and practical applicability.

*Ahta-Shamul Hoque Emran,Hafija Akter,Abdullah Al Shiam,Abu Saleh Musa Miah,Anichur Rahman,Fahmid Al Farid,Hezerul Abdul Karim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an efficient deep-learning framework for brain tumor detection using MRI scans, leveraging ResNet50 and a novel Dense-Dropout sequence for feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely detection of brain tumors is crucial for better patient outcomes, but resources for reliable and efficient detection are limited.

Method: The paper uses a pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction, GAP, linear projection, and introduces a Dense-Dropout sequence to enhance feature learning. It also presents the MMCBT dataset for deep-learning research.

Result: The framework demonstrates robust performance in brain tumor classification with a balanced MMCBT dataset that addresses class imbalance through tumor class augmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed model proves to be an effective solution for brain tumor detection, supported by a new benchmark dataset for advancing the field.

Abstract: Brain tumors are abnormal cell growths in the central nervous system (CNS),
and their timely detection is critical for improving patient outcomes. This
paper proposes an automatic and efficient deep-learning framework for brain
tumor detection from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The framework
employs a pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction, followed by Global
Average Pooling (GAP) and linear projection to obtain compact, high-level image
representations. These features are then processed by a novel Dense-Dropout
sequence, a core contribution of this work, which enhances non-linear feature
learning, reduces overfitting, and improves robustness through diverse feature
transformations. Another major contribution is the creation of the Mymensingh
Medical College Brain Tumor (MMCBT) dataset, designed to address the lack of
reliable brain tumor MRI resources. The dataset comprises MRI scans from 209
subjects (ages 9 to 65), including 3671 tumor and 13273 non-tumor images, all
clinically verified under expert supervision. To overcome class imbalance, the
tumor class was augmented, resulting in a balanced dataset well-suited for deep
learning research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hemorica, a public dataset featuring 372 head CT scans annotated for various Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) subtypes, enabling robust AI development for ICH detection and segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI solutions for timely ICH diagnosis are hindered by fragmented public datasets. A unified and detailed dataset is essential for improving automated detection systems.

Method: The authors created Hemorica, a dataset with exhaustive annotations including classifications, bounding boxes, and 2D/3D masks for five ICH subtypes. Baselines for AI models were tested using advanced architectures like MobileViT and U-Net.

Result: MobileViT-XS achieved an 87.8% F1 score in binary classification, while U-Net with DenseNet161 achieved an 85.5% Dice score for lesion segmentation, demonstrating high annotation quality and adequacy of the dataset.

Conclusion: Hemorica serves as a unified, detailed benchmark dataset supporting advanced AI models for multi-task learning, transferability, and assisting in clinical applications for ICH detection.

Abstract: Timely diagnosis of Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on Computed Tomography (CT)
scans remains a clinical priority, yet the development of robust Artificial
Intelligence (AI) solutions is still hindered by fragmented public data. To
close this gap, we introduce Hemorica, a publicly available collection of 372
head CT examinations acquired between 2012 and 2024. Each scan has been
exhaustively annotated for five ICH subtypes-epidural (EPH), subdural (SDH),
subarachnoid (SAH), intraparenchymal (IPH), and intraventricular (IVH)-yielding
patient-wise and slice-wise classification labels, subtype-specific bounding
boxes, two-dimensional pixel masks and three-dimensional voxel masks. A
double-reading workflow, preceded by a pilot consensus phase and supported by
neurosurgeon adjudication, maintained low inter-rater variability.
Comprehensive statistical analysis confirms the clinical realism of the
dataset. To establish reference baselines, standard convolutional and
transformer architectures were fine-tuned for binary slice classification and
hemorrhage segmentation. With only minimal fine-tuning, lightweight models such
as MobileViT-XS achieved an F1 score of 87.8% in binary classification, whereas
a U-Net with a DenseNet161 encoder reached a Dice score of 85.5% for binary
lesion segmentation that validate both the quality of the annotations and the
sufficiency of the sample size. Hemorica therefore offers a unified,
fine-grained benchmark that supports multi-task and curriculum learning,
facilitates transfer to larger but weakly labelled cohorts, and facilitates the
process of designing an AI-based assistant for ICH detection and quantification
systems.

*Wenbin Teng,Gonglin Chen,Haiwei Chen,Yajie Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARSS, an autoregressive model for novel view generation from a single image, achieving better or comparable quality to diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with world modeling tasks due to their non-causal generation process causing inconsistencies across views. The paper aims to address this limitation by adopting a causal autoregressive approach.

Method: ARSS utilizes a GPT-inspired autoregressive model with a video tokenizer for discrete token mapping and a camera encoder for 3D positional guidance, alongside a transformer module that permutes spatial tokens while preserving temporal order.

Result: ARSS showcases superior or comparable performance compared to state-of-the-art view synthesis methods based on diffusion models in experiments with public datasets.

Conclusion: ARSS successfully applies autoregressive modeling for novel view generation, effectively addressing limitations of diffusion-based approaches and offering a promising alternative.

Abstract: Despite their exceptional generative quality, diffusion models have limited
applicability to world modeling tasks, such as novel view generation from
sparse inputs. This limitation arises because diffusion models generate outputs
in a non-causal manner, often leading to distortions or inconsistencies across
views, and making it difficult to incrementally adapt accumulated knowledge to
new queries. In contrast, autoregressive (AR) models operate in a causal
fashion, generating each token based on all previously generated tokens. In
this work, we introduce \textbf{ARSS}, a novel framework that leverages a
GPT-style decoder-only AR model to generate novel views from a single image,
conditioned on a predefined camera trajectory. We employ a video tokenizer to
map continuous image sequences into discrete tokens and propose a camera
encoder that converts camera trajectories into 3D positional guidance. Then to
enhance generation quality while preserving the autoregressive structure, we
propose a autoregressive transformer module that randomly permutes the spatial
order of tokens while maintaining their temporal order. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method
performs comparably to, or better than, state-of-the-art view synthesis
approaches based on diffusion models. Our code will be released upon paper
acceptance.

*Masato Kobayashi,Ning Ding,Toru Tamaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Action recognition models often overemphasize static elements rather than dynamic motion, which hampers their performance. This paper introduces a method focused on separating dynamic and static components using a statistical independence loss and scene prediction loss to address this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static bias in action recognition models compromises their efficiency in real-world scenarios and limits their ability to generalize for zero-shot action recognition.

Method: The authors propose separating temporal dynamic content from static scene elements using a statistical independence loss between two streams and enhancing it with a scene prediction loss.

Result: Experiments confirmed the method effectively reduces static bias in action recognition models and highlighted the significance of the scene prediction loss.

Conclusion: By addressing static bias through the proposed approach, the paper advances action recognition toward better adaptability in practical and zero-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Action recognition models rely excessively on static cues rather than dynamic
human motion, which is known as static bias. This bias leads to poor
performance in real-world applications and zero-shot action recognition. In
this paper, we propose a method to reduce static bias by separating temporal
dynamic information from static scene information. Our approach uses a
statistical independence loss between biased and unbiased streams, combined
with a scene prediction loss. Our experiments demonstrate that this method
effectively reduces static bias and confirm the importance of scene prediction
loss.

### [375] [Desensitizing for Improving Corruption Robustness in Point Cloud Classification through Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23010)
*Zhiqiang Tian,Weigang Li,Chunhua Deng,Junwei Hu,Yongqiang Wang,Wenping Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the issue of DNN over-reliance on point cloud features, proposing 'Desensitized Adversarial Training' (DesenAT) to enhance model robustness against corrupted point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) due to their over-reliance on input features, which becomes a challenge in the presence of point cloud corruption caused by scene complexity, sensor inaccuracies, and processing limitations.

Method: The proposed solution, DesenAT, involves generating adversarial samples via feature desensitization and performing training within a self-distillation framework. This includes eliminating high-contribution data points, simulating corrupted environments with spatial transformations, and transferring knowledge from clean samples to adversarial samples during training.

Result: Experimental results on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C datasets show that DesenAT improves model robustness to corrupted point clouds while maintaining high performance on clean datasets.

Conclusion: DesenAT effectively reduces DNN sensitivity to point cloud features, enhancing its robustness to input corruption without compromising performance on clean data.

Abstract: Due to scene complexity, sensor inaccuracies, and processing imprecision,
point cloud corruption is inevitable. Over-reliance on input features is the
root cause of DNN vulnerabilities. It remains unclear whether this issue exists
in 3D tasks involving point clouds and whether reducing dependence on these
features can enhance the model's robustness to corrupted point clouds. This
study attempts to answer these questions. Specifically, we quantified the
sensitivity of the DNN to point cloud features using Shapley values and found
that models trained using traditional methods exhibited high sensitivity values
for certain features. Furthermore, under an equal pruning ratio, prioritizing
the pruning of highly sensitive features causes more severe damage to model
performance than random pruning. We propose `Desensitized Adversarial Training'
(DesenAT), generating adversarial samples using feature desensitization and
conducting training within a self-distillation framework, which aims to
alleviate DNN's over-reliance on point clouds features by smoothing
sensitivity. First, data points with high contribution components are
eliminated, and spatial transformation is used to simulate corruption scenes,
generate adversarial samples, and conduct adversarial training on the model.
Next, to compensate for information loss in adversarial samples, we use the
self-distillation method to transfer knowledge from clean samples to
adversarial samples, and perform adversarial training in a distillation
manner.Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C demonstrate show
that the propose method can effectively improve the robustness of the model
without reducing the performance of clean data sets. This code is publicly

TL;DR: FFDP introduces IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels and a distributed framework, significantly improving scalability and efficiency of image registration tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image registration is fundamental in biomedical sciences, but current algorithms fail to scale with modern imaging capabilities.

Method: FFDP integrates non-GEMM bottleneck optimization, convolution-aware tensor sharding, and complements model parallelism for large-scale tasks.

Result: Achieved multimodal registration in unprecedented scales (e.g., 100-micron human brain MRI) and 6-7x speedups while reducing memory usage by 20-59%.

Conclusion: FFDP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in scalability, efficiency, and problem size capacity for image registration tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we propose FFDP, a set of IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels
supplemented with a distributed framework for image registration at
unprecedented scales. Image registration is an inverse problem fundamental to
biomedical and life sciences, but algorithms have not scaled in tandem with
image acquisition capabilities. Our framework complements existing model
parallelism techniques proposed for large-scale transformer training by
optimizing non-GEMM bottlenecks and enabling convolution-aware tensor sharding.
We demonstrate unprecedented capabilities by performing multimodal registration
of a 100 micron ex-vivo human brain MRI volume at native resolution - an
inverse problem more than 570x larger than a standard clinical datum in about a
minute using only 8 A6000 GPUs. FFDP accelerates existing state-of-the-art
optimization and deep learning registration pipelines by upto 6 - 7x while
reducing peak memory consumption by 20 - 59%. Comparative analysis on a 250
micron dataset shows that FFDP can fit upto 64x larger problems than existing
SOTA on a single GPU, and highlights both the performance and efficiency gains
of FFDP compared to SOTA image registration methods.

*Zetian Wu,Tianshuo Zhou,Stefan Lee,Liang Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for sign language translation from text to video, focusing on realistic human motion by considering anatomical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the naturalness and accuracy of body motion in sign language translation videos, addressing the limitations of prior methods that produce biomechanically implausible outputs.

Method: The approach models relationships among skeletal joints with geometric constraints on positions, bone lengths, and dynamics. A parent-relative reweighting mechanism enhances finger flexibility and reduces stiffness, while bone-pose losses and constraints ensure anatomical consistency.

Result: Achieved a 56.51% reduction in the performance gap with the ground truth, and improved anatomical realism by reducing bone length discrepancies by 18.76% and movement variance by 5.48%.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly enhances the anatomical realism and motion naturalness of sign language videos, overcoming limitations of previous techniques.

Abstract: Sign language translation from text to video plays a crucial role in enabling
effective communication for Deaf and hard--of--hearing individuals. A major
challenge lies in generating accurate and natural body poses and movements that
faithfully convey intended meanings. Prior methods often neglect the anatomical
constraints and coordination patterns of human skeletal motion, resulting in
rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs. To address this, we propose a
novel approach that explicitly models the relationships among skeletal
joints--including shoulders, arms, and hands--by incorporating geometric
constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. During
training, we introduce a parent-relative reweighting mechanism to enhance
finger flexibility and reduce motion stiffness. Additionally, bone-pose losses
and bone-length constraints enforce anatomically consistent structures. Our
method narrows the performance gap between the previous best and the
ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, and further reduces discrepancies in bone length
and movement variance by 18.76% and 5.48%, respectively, demonstrating
significant gains in anatomical realism and motion naturalness.

*Yihao Sun,Zhilong Zhang,Yang Yu,Pierre-Luc Bacon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Uni-Plan, a planning framework using Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs), for enhanced decision-making and reasoning by incorporating visual content generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in decision-making tasks, their reliance on text-based reasoning alone is a limitation. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) enables integrated reasoning with visual and textual inputs and outputs, providing a new pathway for better decision-making.

Method: The authors introduce Uni-Plan, a unified planning framework using UMMs where a single model functions as a policy, dynamics model, and value function. They also implement a novel self-discriminated filtering mechanism to prevent invalid predictions by utilizing the model itself as a discriminator.

Result: Uni-Plan significantly improves success rates in long-horizon planning tasks compared to VLM-based methods. It shows high scalability by requiring no expert demonstrations and performs better under the same data conditions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of UMMs in decision-making and reasoning tasks. By integrating visual content generation into planning frameworks and addressing prediction errors, this research establishes a foundation for future advancements in the field.

Abstract: With the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), many recent works have explored using them for
decision-making. However, most of these approaches rely solely on
language-based reasoning, which limits their ability to reason and make
informed decisions. Recently, a promising new direction has emerged with
unified multimodal models (UMMs), which support both multimodal inputs and
outputs. We believe such models have greater potential for decision-making by
enabling reasoning through generated visual content. To this end, we propose
Uni-Plan, a planning framework built on UMMs. Within this framework, a single
model simultaneously serves as the policy, dynamics model, and value function.
In addition, to avoid hallucinations in dynamics predictions, we present a
novel approach self-discriminated filtering, where the generative model serves
as a self-discriminator to filter out invalid dynamics predictions. Experiments
on long-horizon planning tasks show that Uni-Plan substantially improves
success rates compared to VLM-based methods, while also showing strong data
scalability, requiring no expert demonstrations and achieving better
performance under the same training-data size. This work lays a foundation for
future research in reasoning and decision-making with UMMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses copyright infringement concerns in large vision models by introducing DPM, a new detection framework, and a benchmark dataset (CIDD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the ethical and legal risks posed by large vision models like Stable Diffusion, which can memorize and reproduce copyrighted material without consent.

Method: The authors formalize copyright detection using the concept of Differential Privacy, introduce a Conditional Sensitivity metric, and propose the DPM framework that fine-tunes models in opposing directions to detect infringements.

Result: Their DPM framework effectively detects copyright infringement in text-to-image diffusion models, even without access to original training datasets or prompts.

Conclusion: DPM offers a practical and interpretable approach to protecting intellectual property in generative AI, addressing key detection challenges.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large vision models such as Stable Diffusion
raises significant legal and ethical concerns, as these models can memorize and
reproduce copyrighted content without authorization. Existing detection
approaches often lack robustness and fail to provide rigorous theoretical
underpinnings. To address these gaps, we formalize the concept of copyright
infringement and its detection from the perspective of Differential Privacy
(DP), and introduce the conditional sensitivity metric, a concept analogous to
sensitivity in DP, that quantifies the deviation in a diffusion model's output
caused by the inclusion or exclusion of a specific training data point. To
operationalize this metric, we propose D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel post-hoc
detection framework that identifies copyright infringement in text-to-image
diffusion models. Specifically, DPM simulates inclusion and exclusion processes
by fine-tuning models in two opposing directions: learning or unlearning.
Besides, to disentangle concept-specific influence from the global parameter
shifts induced by fine-tuning, DPM computes confidence scores over orthogonal
prompt distributions using statistical metrics. Moreover, to facilitate
standardized benchmarking, we also construct the Copyright Infringement
Detection Dataset (CIDD), a comprehensive resource for evaluating detection
across diverse categories. Our results demonstrate that DPM reliably detects
infringement content without requiring access to the original training dataset
or text prompts, offering an interpretable and practical solution for
safeguarding intellectual property in the era of generative AI.

*Gabriel A. Viana,Luis F. Alves Pereira,Tsang Ing Ren,George D. C. Cavalcanti,Jan Sijbers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the design of perceptual losses for enhancing Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) images, proposing improved configurations for better outcomes compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pixel-wise losses like Mean Squared Error often cause over-smoothed results and loss of clinically important details in LDCT images. Perceptual losses offer an alternative but their effective design remains underexplored.

Method: The authors introduce 'perceptual influence,' a metric assessing the contribution of perceptual loss in training, and systematically explore various design choices such as representation levels, pretrained datasets, and optimization settings.

Result: Experiments reveal that commonly used perceptual loss configurations underperform, and better-designed ones improve noise reduction and preserve structural details in LDCT images without altering the network architecture.

Conclusion: Optimizing perceptual loss designs can significantly improve LDCT image reconstruction performance. The study offers actionable guidelines based on statistical analysis and provides open-source code for implementation.

Abstract: Perceptual losses have emerged as powerful tools for training networks to
enhance Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) images, offering an alternative to
traditional pixel-wise losses such as Mean Squared Error, which often lead to
over-smoothed reconstructions and loss of clinically relevant details in LDCT
images. The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a
pretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level
features rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses
involves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature
representation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the
relative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization.
In this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that
quantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total
loss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss
design choices on the model training performance. Through systematic
experimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature
to set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed
alternatives. Our findings show that better perceptual loss designs lead to
significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of
reconstructed CT images, without requiring any changes to the network
architecture. We also provide objective guidelines, supported by statistical
analysis, to inform the effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising.

### [381] [Sensor-Adaptive Flood Mapping with Pre-trained Multi-Modal Transformers across SAR and Multispectral Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23035)
*Tomohiro Tanaka,Narumasa Tsutsumida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study presents a lightweight transformer model for flexible flood detection using SAR, MS, or combined data, achieving strong performance across scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floods increasingly cause human and economic damage, necessitating rapid and accurate mapping, but current methods struggle with sensor limitations and computational demands.

Method: A sensor-flexible flood detection model fine-tunes a lightweight pre-trained transformer (Presto) with SAR and MS inputs to work in different sensor availability scenarios.

Result: The model outperformed a larger baseline (Prithvi-100M) with an F1 score of 0.896 in sensor fusion, 0.893 in MS-only, and 0.718 in SAR-only scenarios on the Sen1Floods11 dataset.

Conclusion: This efficient, robust, and flexible method supports real-world immediate flood assessments, addressing operational challenges with minimal computational demands.

Abstract: Floods are increasingly frequent natural disasters causing extensive human
and economic damage, highlighting the critical need for rapid and accurate
flood inundation mapping. While remote sensing technologies have advanced flood
monitoring capabilities, operational challenges persist: single-sensor
approaches face weather-dependent data availability and limited revisit
periods, while multi-sensor fusion methods require substantial computational
resources and large-scale labeled datasets. To address these limitations, this
study introduces a novel sensor-flexible flood detection methodology by
fine-tuning Presto, a lightweight ($\sim$0.4M parameters) multi-modal
pre-trained transformer that processes both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and
multispectral (MS) data at the pixel level. Our approach uniquely enables flood
mapping using SAR-only, MS-only, or combined SAR+MS inputs through a single
model architecture, addressing the critical operational need for rapid response
with whatever sensor data becomes available first during disasters. We
evaluated our method on the Sen1Floods11 dataset against the large-scale
Prithvi-100M baseline ($\sim$100M parameters) across three realistic data
availability scenarios. The proposed model achieved superior performance with
an F1 score of 0.896 and mIoU of 0.886 in the optimal sensor-fusion scenario,
outperforming the established baseline. Crucially, the model demonstrated
robustness by maintaining effective performance in MS-only scenarios (F1:
0.893) and functional capabilities in challenging SAR-only conditions (F1:
0.718), confirming the advantage of multi-modal pre-training for operational
flood mapping. Our parameter-efficient, sensor-flexible approach offers an
accessible and robust solution for real-world disaster scenarios requiring
immediate flood extent assessment regardless of sensor availability
constraints.

### [382] [GeLoc3r: Enhancing Relative Camera Pose Regression with Geometric Consistency Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23038)
*Jingxing Li,Yongjae Lee,Deliang Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeLoc3r introduces Geometric Consistency Regularization (GCR) to enhance camera pose regression networks, combining fast inference speed with high accuracy by transferring geometric knowledge during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite its strong performance and speed, ReLoc3R suffers from geometric inconsistencies in its internal representations, which prevent it from achieving the precision of slower correspondence-based methods like MASt3R.

Method: GeLoc3r trains regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses by leveraging ground-truth depth to generate and weight dense 3D-2D correspondences via a FusionTransformer, computing poses with weighted RANSAC during training to create a geometric consistency loss.

Result: GeLoc3r surpasses ReLoc3R on challenging benchmarks, improving metrics like AUC@5° across multiple datasets, with significant achievements such as a 16% relative improvement on CO3Dv2.

Conclusion: By embedding geometric consistency during training, GeLoc3r bridges the speed-accuracy gap between regression and correspondence-based methods, achieving high accuracy without sacrificing fast inference.

Abstract: Prior ReLoc3R achieves breakthrough performance with fast 25ms inference and
state-of-the-art regression accuracy, yet our analysis reveals subtle geometric
inconsistencies in its internal representations that prevent reaching the
precision ceiling of correspondence-based methods like MASt3R (which require
300ms per pair). In this work, we present GeLoc3r, a novel approach to relative
camera pose estimation that enhances pose regression methods through Geometric
Consistency Regularization (GCR). GeLoc3r overcomes the speed-accuracy dilemma
by training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses
without inference-time geometric computation. During training, GeLoc3r
leverages ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights
them using a FusionTransformer that learns correspondence importance, and
computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC. This creates a
consistency loss that transfers geometric knowledge into the regression
network. Unlike FAR method which requires both regression and geometric solving
at inference, GeLoc3r only uses the enhanced regression head at test time,
maintaining ReLoc3R's fast speed and approaching MASt3R's high accuracy. On
challenging benchmarks, GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R, achieving
significant improvements including 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5{\deg} on the CO3Dv2
dataset (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% AUC@5{\deg} on
RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500. By teaching geometric
consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, GeLoc3r
represents a paradigm shift in how neural networks learn camera geometry,
achieving both the speed of regression and the geometric understanding of
correspondence methods.

*Ye-eun Kim,Suhyeon Lim,Andrew J. Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops a system using deep learning for Human Action Recognition (HAR) targeted at stroke patients' rehabilitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for stroke rehabilitation therapy, coupled with a shortage of medical staff, necessitates the development of alternative approaches like remote monitoring systems.

Method: A system was developed using IMU sensors and an RGB-D camera to collect multimodal data, accompanied by a deep learning model for HAR. The collected dataset underwent preprocessing to tailor it for the application.

Result: The action data of stroke patients showed less clustering compared to non-disabled individuals. The proposed model revealed tendencies to classify difficult-to-cluster features.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of deep learning models to both recognize stroke patients' actions and provide feedback for domiciliary rehabilitation, with future research required for broader applications.

Abstract: Rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients faces a supply shortage despite
the increasing demand. To address this issue, remote monitoring systems that
reduce the burden on medical staff are emerging as a viable alternative. A key
component of these remote monitoring systems is Human Action Recognition (HAR)
technology, which classifies actions. However, existing HAR studies have
primarily focused on non-disable individuals, making them unsuitable for
recognizing the actions of stroke patients. HAR research for stroke has largely
concentrated on classifying relatively simple actions using machine learning
rather than deep learning. In this study, we designed a system to monitor the
actions of stroke patients, focusing on domiciliary upper limb Activities of
Daily Living (ADL). Our system utilizes IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors
and an RGB-D camera, which are the most common modalities in HAR. We directly
collected a dataset through this system, investigated an appropriate preprocess
and proposed a deep learning model suitable for processing multimodal data. We
analyzed the collected dataset and found that the action data of stroke
patients is less clustering than that of non-disabled individuals.
Simultaneously, we found that the proposed model learns similar tendencies for
each label in data with features that are difficult to clustering. This study
suggests the possibility of expanding the deep learning model, which has
learned the action features of stroke patients, to not only simple action
recognition but also feedback such as assessment contributing to domiciliary
rehabilitation in future research. The code presented in this study is
available at https://github.com/ye-Kim/MMeViT.

### [384] [Activation Matching for Explanation Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23051)
*Pirzada Suhail,Aditya Anand,Amit Sethi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an activation-matching method using lightweight autoencoders to create minimal, interpretable binary masks that explain classifier decisions faithfully.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for practical and faithful explanations of pretrained model decisions by generating small, interpretable explanations that retain prediction accuracy.

Method: They use a lightweight autoencoder to generate a binary mask by optimizing objectives like activation matching, mask priors (L1 area, binarization, total variation), and abductive constraints.

Result: The proposed method produces compact, interpretable binary masks that align with model predictions while discarding irrelevant image regions.

Conclusion: The approach successfully provides effective and human-interpretable minimalist explanations for pretrained classifier decisions.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce an activation-matching--based approach to generate
minimal, faithful explanations for the decision-making of a pretrained
classifier on any given image. Given an input image \(x\) and a frozen model
\(f\), we train a lightweight autoencoder to output a binary mask \(m\) such
that the explanation \(e = m \odot x\) preserves both the model's prediction
and the intermediate activations of \(x\). Our objective combines: (i)
multi-layer activation matching with KL divergence to align distributions and
cross-entropy to retain the top-1 label for both the image and the explanation;
(ii) mask priors -- L1 area for minimality, a binarization penalty for crisp
0/1 masks, and total variation for compactness; and (iii) abductive constraints
for faithfulness and necessity. Together, these objectives yield small,
human-interpretable masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding
irrelevant input regions, providing practical and faithful minimalist
explanations for the decision making of the underlying model.

*Ruilang Wang,Shuotong Xu,Bowen Liu,Runlin Huang,Donglong Chen,Weifeng Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a text-driven masking framework for medical image analysis named 'Mask What Matters,' improving semantic alignment, efficiency, and cross-task generalizability in self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of annotated data in specialized domains like medical imaging creates challenges for training robust vision models, highlighting a need for improved self-supervised learning methods.

Method: It leverages vision-language models for text-guided, prompt-based region localization to apply differentiated masking on diagnostically relevant areas, reducing redundancy and promoting better representation learning.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing MIM approaches, with gains in classification accuracy, box average precision, and mask average precision, while also using a lower masking ratio.

Conclusion: Text-driven, controllable masking enhances semantically aligned self-supervised learning, paving the way for more effective vision models in medical image analysis.

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated data in specialized domains such as medical imaging
presents significant challenges to training robust vision models. While
self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) offers a promising solution,
existing approaches largely rely on random high-ratio masking, leading to
inefficiency and poor semantic alignment. Moreover, region-aware variants
typically depend on reconstruction heuristics or supervised signals, limiting
their adaptability across tasks and modalities. We propose Mask What Matters, a
controllable text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image
analysis. By leveraging vision-language models for prompt-based region
localization, our method flexibly applies differentiated masking to emphasize
diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas.
This controllable design enables better semantic alignment, improved
representation learning, and stronger cross-task generalizability.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple medical imaging modalities, including
brain MRI, chest CT, and lung X-ray, shows that Mask What Matters consistently
outperforms existing MIM methods (e.g., SparK), achieving gains of up to +3.1
percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in box average precision
(BoxAP), and +1.1 in mask average precision (MaskAP) for detection. Notably, it
achieves these improvements with substantially lower overall masking ratios
(e.g., 40\% vs. 70\%). This work demonstrates that controllable, text-driven
masking can enable semantically aligned self-supervised learning, advancing the
development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.

*Ben Liang,Yuan Liu,Bingwen Qiu,Yihong Wang,Xiubao Sui,Qian Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMC-DETR proposes a novel framework for improving aerial object detection by integrating enhanced global context feature fusion and advanced non-linear modeling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aerial object detection faces challenges such as detecting tiny objects and effectively utilizing global contextual information in complex scenes.

Method: The paper introduces FMC-DETR, utilizing the WeKat backbone for global context enhancement, CPF for reducing redundancy, and MDFC for coordinating spatial and frequency information.

Result: Experiments show significant performance improvement, with FMC-DETR achieving 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 gains on the VisDrone dataset.

Conclusion: FMC-DETR demonstrates the ability to outperform existing methods for detecting tiny objects in aerial imagery using fewer parameters, offering state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Aerial-view object detection is a critical technology for real-world
applications such as natural resource monitoring, traffic management, and
UAV-based search and rescue. Detecting tiny objects in high-resolution aerial
imagery presents a long-standing challenge due to their limited visual cues and
the difficulty of modeling global context in complex scenes. Existing methods
are often hampered by delayed contextual fusion and inadequate non-linear
modeling, failing to effectively use global information to refine shallow
features and thus encountering a performance bottleneck. To address these
challenges, we propose FMC-DETR, a novel framework with frequency-decoupled
fusion for aerial-view object detection. First, we introduce the Wavelet
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (WeKat) backbone, which applies cascaded wavelet
transforms to enhance global low-frequency context perception in shallow
features while preserving fine-grained details, and employs Kolmogorov-Arnold
networks to achieve adaptive non-linear modeling of multi-scale dependencies.
Next, a lightweight Cross-stage Partial Fusion (CPF) module reduces redundancy
and improves multi-scale feature interaction. Finally, we introduce the
Multi-Domain Feature Coordination (MDFC) module, which unifies spatial,
frequency, and structural priors to to balance detail preservation and global
enhancement. Extensive experiments on benchmark aerial-view datasets
demonstrate that FMC-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer
parameters. On the challenging VisDrone dataset, our model achieves
improvements of 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 over the baseline, highlighting its
effectiveness in tiny object detection. The code can be accessed at

*Yutao Shen,Junkun Yuan,Toru Aonishi,Hideki Nakayama,Yue Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper revisits core issues in image inpainting with preference alignment, focusing on leveraging reward models and preference data without introducing novel methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fundamental issues in achieving alignment when optimizing image inpainting, focusing on direct preference optimization methods.

Method: The researchers utilize direct preference optimization, construct preference datasets using public reward models, and test across various experiments involving nine reward models, benchmarks, and baselines.

Result: Key findings include robust preference data trends, presence of biases in reward models, and the effectiveness of ensemble models in mitigating bias; alignment models outperformed prior baselines significantly.

Conclusion: The paper sets a strong baseline by leveraging existing methods with improvements in performance and proposes a robust direction for future work in preference alignment of image inpainting.

Abstract: This paper investigates image inpainting with preference alignment. Instead
of introducing a novel method, we go back to basics and revisit fundamental
problems in achieving such alignment. We leverage the prominent direct
preference optimization approach for alignment training and employ public
reward models to construct preference training datasets. Experiments are
conducted across nine reward models, two benchmarks, and two baseline models
with varying structures and generative algorithms. Our key findings are as
follows: (1) Most reward models deliver valid reward scores for constructing
preference data, even if some of them are not reliable evaluators. (2)
Preference data demonstrates robust trends in both candidate scaling and sample
scaling across models and benchmarks. (3) Observable biases in reward models,
particularly in brightness, composition, and color scheme, render them
susceptible to cause reward hacking. (4) A simple ensemble of these models
yields robust and generalizable results by mitigating such biases. Built upon
these observations, our alignment models significantly outperform prior models
across standard metrics, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluations, without any
changes to model structures or the use of new datasets. We hope our work can
set a simple yet solid baseline, pushing this promising frontier. Our code is

*Ziyu Su,Abdul Rehman Akbar,Usama Sajjad,Anil V. Parwani,Muhammad Khalid Khan Niazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XMAG is a lightweight foundation model that reduces computational costs in histopathology by using cross-magnification distillation from high to lower magnification data, achieving comparable accuracy with significantly faster processing speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models in computational pathology are highly effective but computationally expensive for clinical use.

Method: The study introduced XMAG, employing a compact backbone and a cross-magnification distillation method to transfer knowledge from high (20x) to low (5x) magnification levels.

Result: XMAG demonstrated diagnostic accuracy within 1% of larger models, improved its speed 30-fold, and processed 8.8 whole slide images per minute. It showed robust generalization in cross-institutional validation.

Conclusion: Cross-magnification distillation allows efficient foundation model deployment in clinical pathology, making real-time AI integration feasible in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Foundation models (FM) have transformed computational pathology but remain
computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to their massive
parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements. Here, we
introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification
distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification
teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a
compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer
patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel
distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning
both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained
XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and
evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis
tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within
1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold
processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our
cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we
developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's
performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish
cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM
capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially
enabling real-time pathology AI integration.

*Na Min An,Inha Kang,Minhyun Lee,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPatch proposes a zero-shot RIS framework that improves spatial understanding in vision-language models, achieving enhanced mask selection without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address the limitations of existing vision-language models (like CLIP) that struggle with spatial relationships in image-linguistic tasks.

Method: CoPatch enhances spatial representations by creating hybrid text features with spatial cues and extracting patch-level image features where spatial structure is preserved, fusing them into a similarity map (CoMap).

Result: CoPatch achieves significant improvement in zero-shot RIS performance across datasets (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut) with gains of 2-7 mIoU.

Conclusion: Recovering and utilizing spatial knowledge within vision-language models can substantially improve zero-shot RIS, opening new research directions in this domain.

Abstract: Spatial grounding is crucial for referring image segmentation (RIS), where
the goal of the task is to localize an object described by language. Current
foundational vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, excel at aligning
images and text but struggle with understanding spatial relationships. Within
the language stream, most existing methods often focus on the primary noun
phrase when extracting local text features, undermining contextual tokens.
Within the vision stream, CLIP generates similar features for images with
different spatial layouts, resulting in limited sensitivity to spatial
structure. To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{CoPatch}, a
zero-shot RIS framework that leverages internal model components to enhance
spatial representations in both text and image modalities. For language,
\textsc{CoPatch} constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context
tokens carrying spatial cues. For vision, it extracts patch-level image
features using our novel path discovered from intermediate layers, where
spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a
clustered image-text similarity map, \texttt{CoMap}, enabling precise mask
selection. As a result, \textsc{CoPatch} significantly improves spatial
grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut (+
2--7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training. Our findings underscore
the importance of recovering and leveraging the untapped spatial knowledge
inherently embedded in VLMs, thereby paving the way for opportunities in
zero-shot RIS.

by BEiT at 80.00 and Swin Transformer at 79.73, all demonstrating strong
F1-scores. ViT and DeiT achieved accuracies of 79.37 and 78.79, respectively,
but both struggled particularly with Caries-related classes.

performance, making them promising candidates for clinical application in
dental imaging. These findings provide guidance for model selection in future
AI-driven oral disease diagnostic tools and highlight the importance of
addressing data imbalance in real-world scenarios

*Emadeldeen Hamdan,Ahmet Enis Cetin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HTMA-Net combines Hadamard Transform with multiplication-avoiding operations to significantly reduce multiplications while maintaining accuracy in deep neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks require reduction in multiplication costs for energy-efficient deployment, especially on edge devices with constrained resources.

Method: Introduced HTMA-Net, which integrates Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers and SRAM-based multiplication-avoiding operations to optimize computations in convolutional layers.

Result: HTMA-Net reduces multiplications by up to 52% on models like ResNet-18 and ResNet-50, with comparable accuracy and reduced parameters.

Conclusion: Combining Hadamard Transform with in-memory multiplication-avoiding techniques is promising for building efficient deep learning models.

Abstract: Reducing the cost of multiplications is critical for efficient deep neural
network deployment, especially in energy-constrained edge devices. In this
work, we introduce HTMA-Net, a novel framework that integrates the Hadamard
Transform (HT) with multiplication-avoiding (MA) SRAM-based in-memory computing
to reduce arithmetic complexity while maintaining accuracy. Unlike prior
methods that only target multiplications in convolutional layers or focus
solely on in-memory acceleration, HTMA-Net selectively replaces intermediate
convolutions with Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers whose internal
convolutions are implemented via multiplication-avoiding in-memory operations.
We evaluate HTMA-Net on ResNet-18 using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet,
and provide a detailed comparison against regular, MF-only, and HT-only
variants. Results show that HTMA-Net eliminates up to 52\% of multiplications
compared to baseline ResNet-18, ResNet-20, and ResNet-50 models, while
achieving comparable accuracy in evaluation and significantly reducing
computational complexity and the number of parameters. Our results demonstrate
that combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory
computing multiplication-avoiding operators is a promising path towards
efficient deep learning architectures.

TL;DR: The paper addresses gaps in remote sensing change understanding (RSCU) by introducing a new dataset, ChangeIMTI, and a novel vision-language model, ChangeVG, for multiple related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the limitations of existing datasets which lack deep understanding and effective interaction across tasks such as change captioning, counting, and localization in remote sensing image analysis.

Method: The work introduces ChangeIMTI, a large-scale multi-task dataset for diverse RSCU tasks, and a dual-granularity vision-language model, ChangeVG, with a dual-branch architecture for bi-temporal images. ChangeVG enhances large vision-language models using enriched spatial and semantic representations during instruction tuning.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method excels across four RSCU tasks, with significant improvements in change captioning, outperforming the strongest competitor (Semantic-CC) by 1.39 points in the S*m metric. Critical components were also studied in ablation experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and model significantly advance the state of RSCU, demonstrating improved performance and capability across tasks like change captioning. The study highlights the potential of enriched hierarchical cross-modal learning for remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Remote sensing change understanding (RSCU) is essential for analyzing remote
sensing images and understanding how human activities affect the environment.
However, existing datasets lack deep understanding and interactions in the
diverse change captioning, counting, and localization tasks. To tackle these
gaps, we construct ChangeIMTI, a new large-scale interactive multi-task
instruction dataset that encompasses four complementary tasks including change
captioning, binary change classification, change counting, and change
localization. Building upon this new dataset, we further design a novel
vision-guided vision-language model (ChangeVG) with dual-granularity awareness
for bi-temporal remote sensing images (i.e., two remote sensing images of the
same area at different times). The introduced vision-guided module is a
dual-branch architecture that synergistically combines fine-grained spatial
feature extraction with high-level semantic summarization. These enriched
representations further serve as the auxiliary prompts to guide large
vision-language models (VLMs) (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) during instruction tuning,
thereby facilitating the hierarchical cross-modal learning. We extensively
conduct experiments across four tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Remarkably, on the change captioning task, our method outperforms the
strongest method Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on the comprehensive S*m metric,
which integrates the semantic similarity and descriptive accuracy to provide an
overall evaluation of change caption. Moreover, we also perform a series of
ablation studies to examine the critical components of our method.

*Chenrui Ma,Xi Xiao,Tianyang Wang,Xiao Wang,Yanning Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified multistage generative framework with a Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy to improve fidelity and efficiency in image generation, mitigating computation-fidelity trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models either lose detail and fidelity due to reliance on VAEs or face excessive computational costs when working in pixel space. Cascade models, while computationally efficient, fail to optimize end-to-end and learn distributions effectively.

Method: The authors propose a Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy that enables generative processes to be decomposed into interpolant trajectories across multiple stages, modeled as a single unified Diffusion Transformer for effective distribution learning and knowledge sharing.

Result: Experiments validate the model's ability to achieve high fidelity and computational efficiency across various resolutions.

Conclusion: The unified framework addresses key limitations of existing image generation models, offering a computationally efficient and high-fidelity alternative with end-to-end optimization.

Abstract: Existing image generation models face critical challenges regarding the
trade-off between computation and fidelity. Specifically, models relying on a
pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) suffer from information loss, limited
detail, and the inability to support end-to-end training. In contrast, models
operating directly in the pixel space incur prohibitive computational cost.
Although cascade models can mitigate computational cost, stage-wise separation
prevents effective end-to-end optimization, hampers knowledge sharing, and
often results in inaccurate distribution learning within each stage. To address
these challenges, we introduce a unified multistage generative framework based
on our proposed Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy. It decomposes the
generative process into interpolant trajectories at multiple stages, ensuring
accurate distribution learning while enabling end-to-end optimization.
Importantly, the entire process is modeled as a single unified Diffusion
Transformer, eliminating the need for disjoint modules and also enabling
knowledge sharing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
both high fidelity and efficiency across multiple resolutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to overcome limitations in NCCT imaging such as low image contrast and signal-to-noise ratio for fast and accurate stroke diagnosis.

Conclusion: DINOv3 can improve automated stroke diagnosis from NCCT images, though the paper also highlights the current constraints of this method.

Abstract: Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) is essential for rapid stroke
diagnosis but is limited by low image contrast and signal to noise ratio. We
address this challenge by leveraging DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised
vision transformer, to generate powerful feature representations for a
comprehensive set of stroke analysis tasks. Our evaluation encompasses infarct
and hemorrhage segmentation, anomaly classification (normal vs. stroke and
normal vs. infarct vs. hemorrhage), hemorrhage subtype classification (EDH,
SDH, SAH, IPH, IVH), and dichotomized ASPECTS classification (<=6 vs. >6) on
multiple public and private datasets. This study establishes strong benchmarks
for these tasks and demonstrates the potential of advanced self-supervised
models to improve automated stroke diagnosis from NCCT, providing a clear
analysis of both the advantages and current constraints of the approach. The

TL;DR: The paper introduces Earth-Agent, a framework for Earth observation combining RGB and spectral data for advanced reasoning tasks, along with an evaluation benchmark, Earth-Bench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent MLLMs lack multi-step reasoning and domain-specific tools capability in Earth observation; current agent-based methods are underdeveloped.

Method: Earth-Agent integrates RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP tool ecosystem for advanced reasoning. It also proposes Earth-Bench for evaluation.

Result: Earth-Agent outperformed general agent frameworks and MLLMs in remote sensing tasks through experiments.

Conclusion: Earth-Agent creates a new paradigm for scientifically grounded LLM applications in EO, with benchmarking and resources made publicly available.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) is essential for understanding the evolving states of
the Earth system. Although recent MLLMs have advanced EO research, they still
lack the capability to tackle complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning
and the use of domain-specific tools. Agent-based methods offer a promising
direction, but current attempts remain in their infancy, confined to RGB
perception, shallow reasoning, and lacking systematic evaluation protocols. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce Earth-Agent, the first agentic
framework that unifies RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP-based tool
ecosystem, enabling cross-modal, multi-step, and quantitative spatiotemporal
reasoning beyond pretrained MLLMs. Earth-Agent supports complex scientific
tasks such as geophysical parameter retrieval and quantitative spatiotemporal
analysis by dynamically invoking expert tools and models across modalities. To
support comprehensive evaluation, we further propose Earth-Bench, a benchmark
of 248 expert-curated tasks with 13,729 images, spanning spectrum, products and
RGB modalities, and equipped with a dual-level evaluation protocol that
assesses both reasoning trajectories and final outcomes. We conduct
comprehensive experiments varying different LLM backbones, comparisons with
general agent frameworks, and comparisons with MLLMs on remote sensing
benchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness and potential of Earth-Agent.
Earth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, moving the field toward
scientifically grounded, next-generation applications of LLMs in Earth
observation. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.

*Wenxuan Fang,Jiangwei Weng,Jianjun Qian,Jian Yang,Jun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WeatherCycle, an unsupervised image restoration framework designed to handle diverse weather conditions using a unique bidirectional degradation-content translation approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of existing methods, which rely on specific physical priors and struggle with generalization to varied real-world weather scenarios.

Method: WeatherCycle employs lumina-chroma decomposition to separate degradation from content, a Lumina Degradation Guidance Module (LDGM) to model versatile degradations via frequency-domain techniques, and Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR) to enhance semantic consistency through hard sample identification.

Result: WeatherCycle outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches in handling multi-weather conditions, showcasing its strong generalization to complex degradations across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a scalable and effective solution for unsupervised weather restoration, addressing limitations of prior works and demonstrating broad applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Unsupervised image restoration under multi-weather conditions remains a
fundamental yet underexplored challenge. While existing methods often rely on
task-specific physical priors, their narrow focus limits scalability and
generalization to diverse real-world weather scenarios. In this work, we
propose \textbf{WeatherCycle}, a unified unpaired framework that reformulates
weather restoration as a bidirectional degradation-content translation cycle,
guided by degradation-aware curriculum regularization. At its core,
WeatherCycle employs a \textit{lumina-chroma decomposition} strategy to
decouple degradation from content without modeling complex weather, enabling
domain conversion between degraded and clean images. To model diverse and
complex degradations, we propose a \textit{Lumina Degradation Guidance Module}
(LDGM), which learns luminance degradation priors from a degraded image pool
and injects them into clean images via frequency-domain amplitude modulation,
enabling controllable and realistic degradation modeling. Additionally, we
incorporate a \textit{Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR)}
module that identifies hard samples via a CLIP-based classifier and enforces
contrastive alignment between hard samples and restored features to enhance
semantic consistency and robustness. Extensive experiments across serve
multi-weather datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance among unsupervised approaches, with strong generalization to
complex weather degradations.

TL;DR: The paper presents Sparse2Dense, a framework designed for ultra-low bitrate human video compression and vertex prediction using sparse 3D keypoints as compact symbols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is harmonizing dynamic motion modeling, detailed appearance synthesis, and geometric consistency to achieve efficient bandwidth-constrained multimedia communication.

Method: Sparse2Dense employs a multi-task learning deep generative model driven by sparse 3D keypoints. It encodes complex human motion and integrates video generation with vertex prediction for geometric alignment.

Result: Experiments show Sparse2Dense delivers competitive compression performance compared to traditional and generative codecs, while achieving precise vertex prediction for downstream applications.

Conclusion: Sparse2Dense is suitable for bandwidth-efficient human-centric media transmission, such as real-time motion analysis and immersive entertainment.

Abstract: For bandwidth-constrained multimedia applications, simultaneously achieving
ultra-low bitrate human video compression and accurate vertex prediction
remains a critical challenge, as it demands the harmonization of dynamic motion
modeling, detailed appearance synthesis, and geometric consistency. To address
this challenge, we propose Sparse2Dense, a keypoint-driven generative framework
that leverages extremely sparse 3D keypoints as compact transmitted symbols to
enable ultra-low bitrate human video compression and precise human vertex
prediction. The key innovation is the multi-task learning-based and
keypoint-aware deep generative model, which could encode complex human motion
via compact 3D keypoints and leverage these sparse keypoints to estimate dense
motion for video synthesis with temporal coherence and realistic textures.
Additionally, a vertex predictor is integrated to learn human vertex geometry
through joint optimization with video generation, ensuring alignment between
visual content and geometric structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed Sparse2Dense framework achieves competitive compression
performance for human video over traditional/generative video codecs, whilst
enabling precise human vertex prediction for downstream geometry applications.
As such, Sparse2Dense is expected to facilitate bandwidth-efficient
human-centric media transmission, such as real-time motion analysis, virtual
human animation, and immersive entertainment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an AI-driven, video-based method for vehicle axle counting using advanced object detection and tracking algorithms, achieving better accuracy even in complex traffic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate vehicle axle counting is critical for improving traffic management, tolling, and infrastructure, but current systems struggle in complex environments like dense traffic and occlusions.

Method: The approach combines YOLO-OBB for vehicle detection, YOLO for tire detection, and a novel TRAX algorithm to track and associate axles under challenging scenarios such as occlusions and long vehicles.

Result: The proposed system reduces false positives and improves axle-counting accuracy in real-world traffic videos, particularly in complex cases like long and occluded vehicles.

Conclusion: The paper presents a robust and scalable AI-based axle counting system that outperforms traditional roadside infrastructure, offering innovations for real-world, dense traffic situations.

Abstract: Accurate counting of vehicle axles is essential for traffic control, toll
collection, and infrastructure development. We present an end-to-end,
video-based pipeline for axle counting that tackles limitations of previous
works in dense environments. Our system leverages a combination of YOLO-OBB to
detect and categorize vehicles, and YOLO to detect tires. Detected tires are
intelligently associated to their respective parent vehicles, enabling accurate
axle prediction even in complex scenarios. However, there are a few challenges
in detection when it comes to scenarios with longer and occluded vehicles. We
mitigate vehicular occlusions and partial detections for longer vehicles by
proposing a novel TRAX (Tire and Axle Tracking) Algorithm to successfully track
axle-related features between frames. Our method stands out by significantly
reducing false positives and improving the accuracy of axle-counting for long
vehicles, demonstrating strong robustness in real-world traffic videos. This
work represents a significant step toward scalable, AI-driven axle counting
systems, paving the way for machine vision to replace legacy roadside
infrastructure.

### [399] [Confidence-Calibrating Regularization for Robust Brain MRI Segmentation Under Domain Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23176)
*Behraj Khan,Tahir Qasim Syed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalSAM enhances the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for brain MRI segmentation, addressing domain shift and overconfidence via novel penalties, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The SAM model underperforms in medical imaging due to domain shifts and overconfidence, necessitating enhancements for reliable brain MRI segmentation.

Method: CalSAM uses two penalties: the Feature Fisher Information Penalty (FIP) reduces domain sensitivity, and the Confidence Misalignment Penalty (CMP) addresses overconfident errors. Only the mask decoder is fine-tuned, while encoders remain frozen.

Result: CalSAM achieves substantial accuracy and calibration gains, including 7.4% improvement in DSC, 26.9% reduction in HD95, and 39.5% reduction in ECE in key evaluations.

Conclusion: CalSAM significantly improves domain generalization and uncertainty estimates in brain MRI segmentation, maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits strong zero-shot performance on
natural images but suffers from domain shift and overconfidence when applied to
medical volumes. We propose \textbf{CalSAM}, a lightweight adaptation framework
that (i) reduces encoder sensitivity to domain shift via a \emph{Feature Fisher
Information Penalty} (FIP) computed on 3D feature maps and (ii) penalizes
overconfident voxel-wise errors through a \emph{Confidence Misalignment
Penalty} (CMP). The combined loss, \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CalSAM}}\) fine-tunes
only the mask decoder while keeping SAM's encoders frozen. On cross-center and
scanner-shift evaluations, CalSAM substantially improves accuracy and
calibration: e.g., on the BraTS scanner split (Siemens$\to$GE) CalSAM shows a
$+7.4\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$ (80.1\% vs.\ 74.6\%), a
$-26.9\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{HD95}$ (4.6 mm vs.\ 6.3 mm), and a $-39.5\%$
reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.2\% vs.\ 8.6\%). On ATLAS-C (motion
corruptions), CalSAM achieves a $+5.3\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$
(75.9\%) and a $-32.6\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.8\%). Ablations show
FIP and CMP contribute complementary gains ($p<0.01$), and the Fisher penalty
incurs a modest $\sim$15\% training-time overhead. CalSAM therefore delivers
improved domain generalization and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates for
brain MRI segmentation, while retaining the computational benefits of freezing
SAM's encoder.

*Yifan Zhang,Wei Zhang,Chuangxin He,Zhonghua Miao,Junhui Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an unsupervised framework for online 3D instance segmentation leveraging synthetic data generation, flexible temporal sampling, and dynamic weighting loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unsupervised 3D instance segmentation challenge, overcoming noise-prone pseudo-label dependency, limited training diversity, and rigid temporal sampling in existing methods.

Method: Synthesizes diverse point cloud sequences for unsupervised training, integrates flexible adjacent and non-adjacent frame sampling to capture long/short temporal features, and introduces dynamic weighting loss to selectively emphasize high-quality samples.

Result: Demonstrates superior segmentation accuracy and temporal consistency over state-of-the-art methods on datasets like SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses unsupervised 3D segmentation limitations and delivers robust performance improvements. Public code release ensures reproducibility.

Abstract: Unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging
task, as it requires maintaining consistent object identities across LiDAR
scans without relying on annotated training data. Existing methods, such as
UNIT, have made progress in this direction but remain constrained by limited
training diversity, rigid temporal sampling, and heavy dependence on noisy
pseudo-labels. We propose a new framework that enriches the training
distribution through synthetic point cloud sequence generation, enabling
greater diversity without relying on manual labels or simulation engines. To
better capture temporal dynamics, our method incorporates a flexible sampling
strategy that leverages both adjacent and non-adjacent frames, allowing the
model to learn from long-range dependencies as well as short-term variations.
In addition, a dynamic-weighting loss emphasizes confident and informative
samples, guiding the network toward more robust representations. Through
extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet, our method
consistently outperforms UNIT and other unsupervised baselines, achieving
higher segmentation accuracy and more robust temporal associations. The code
will be publicly available at github.com/Eaphan/SFT3D.

*Andrey Kaznacheev,Matvey Mikhalchuk,Andrey Kuznetsov,Aleksandr Petiushko,Anton Razzhigaev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents GaP (Gaussian Patch), a method for creating adversarial patches to deceive face recognition systems effectively, even under strict black-box conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the security threat posed by adversarial attacks on face recognition systems, particularly exploring methods that work in the physical world and require minimal knowledge of the target system.

Method: The authors propose GaP, which uses a query-efficient zero-order greedy algorithm to iteratively construct a universal, physically transferable adversarial patch optimized through Gaussian blob additions on the forehead, relying on cosine similarity scores from a surrogate model.

Result: GaP successfully degrades identity recognition with approximately 10,000 queries to a black-box ArcFace model and shows high success rates in both digital and physical testing. It demonstrates strong transferability by also deceiving a completely unseen FaceNet model.

Conclusion: The study reveals a critical security vulnerability in face recognition systems, proving that robust adversarial attacks can be developed with constrained, black-box access.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition (FR) systems pose a significant
security threat, yet most are confined to the digital domain or require
white-box access. We introduce GaP (Gaussian Patch), a novel method to generate
a universal, physically transferable adversarial patch under a strict black-box
setting. Our approach uses a query-efficient, zero-order greedy algorithm to
iteratively construct a symmetric, grayscale pattern for the forehead. The
patch is optimized by successively adding Gaussian blobs, guided only by the
cosine similarity scores from a surrogate FR model to maximally degrade
identity recognition. We demonstrate that with approximately 10,000 queries to
a black-box ArcFace model, the resulting GaP achieves a high attack success
rate in both digital and real-world physical tests. Critically, the attack
shows strong transferability, successfully deceiving an entirely unseen FaceNet
model. Our work highlights a practical and severe vulnerability, proving that
robust, transferable attacks can be crafted with limited knowledge of the
target system.

Conclusion: UltraUNet offers a fast, reliable, and resource-efficient solution for speech articulation studies and clinical diagnostics, advancing the field of ultrasound tongue imaging.

Abstract: Ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI) is a non-invasive and cost-effective tool for
studying speech articulation, motor control, and related disorders. However,
real-time tongue contour segmentation remains challenging due to low
signal-to-noise ratios, imaging variability, and computational demands. We

### [403] [Patch Rebirth: Toward Fast and Transferable Model Inversion of Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23235)
*Seongsoo Heo,Dong-Wan Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Patch Rebirth Inversion (PRI), a method to improve computational efficiency and performance of model inversion for Vision Transformers without discarding patches prematurely, as opposed to prior approaches like Sparse Model Inversion (SMI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model inversion methods struggle with computational inefficiency when applied to Vision Transformers, especially Sparse Model Inversion (SMI), which disregards patches but may hinder knowledge transfer.

Method: The authors propose PRI, which progressively detaches important patches during inversion while allowing less informative patches to evolve and acquire class-relevant knowledge. This balances class-agnostic and class-specific features, leading to efficient yet effective inversion.

Result: PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion compared to Dense Model Inversion (DMI) and 2x faster than SMI. It consistently outperforms SMI and matches DMI in accuracy.

Conclusion: PRI successfully balances computational efficiency with performance, addressing the shortcomings of previous methods by leveraging a 'Re-Birth' effect in patch-level knowledge acquisition.

Abstract: Model inversion is a widely adopted technique in data-free learning that
reconstructs synthetic inputs from a pretrained model through iterative
optimization, without access to original training data. Unfortunately, its
application to state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) poses a major
computational challenge, due to their expensive self-attention mechanisms. To
address this, Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) was proposed to improve efficiency
by pruning and discarding seemingly unimportant patches, which were even
claimed to be obstacles to knowledge transfer. However, our empirical findings
suggest the opposite: even randomly selected patches can eventually acquire
transferable knowledge through continued inversion. This reveals that
discarding any prematurely inverted patches is inefficient, as it suppresses
the extraction of class-agnostic features essential for knowledge transfer,
along with class-specific features. In this paper, we propose Patch Rebirth
Inversion (PRI), a novel approach that incrementally detaches the most
important patches during the inversion process to construct sparse synthetic
images, while allowing the remaining patches to continue evolving for future
selection. This progressive strategy not only improves efficiency, but also
encourages initially less informative patches to gradually accumulate more
class-relevant knowledge, a phenomenon we refer to as the Re-Birth effect,
thereby effectively balancing class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge.
Experimental results show that PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than
standard Dense Model Inversion (DMI) and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently
outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching the performance of DMI.

*Mingfei Han,Haihong Hao,Jinxing Zhou,Zhihui Li,Yuhui Zheng,Xueqing Deng,Linjie Yang,Xiaojun Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework to reduce hallucinations in vision-language models through a self-consistency mechanism, bypassing the need for human annotations or external supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the issue of hallucination in vision-language models, where models generate inaccurate or imaginary details, compromising their output reliability.

Method: The authors design a self-reflection pipeline that compares detailed model responses to concise binary answers. The consistency between these responses is leveraged to automatically generate high-quality training data without relying on human annotations or external model supervision.

Result: The method significantly improves factual grounding and reliability in vision-language models, as demonstrated through experiments on benchmarks such as AMBER, MultiObject-Hal (ROPE), Object HalBench, and MMHal-Bench.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively reduces hallucinations in vision-language models using only unlabeled data. It also maintains strong instruction-following capabilities, verified by enhancement on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench tests.

Abstract: Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent
objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise output reliability. Existing
methods typically address these issues via extensive human annotations or
external supervision from more powerful models. In this work, we present a
novel framework that leverages the model's self-consistency between long
responses and short answers to generate preference pairs for training. We
observe that short binary questions tend to yield highly reliable responses,
which can be used to query the target model to evaluate and rank its generated
responses. Specifically, we design a self-reflection pipeline where detailed
model responses are compared against concise binary answers, and inconsistency
signals are utilized to automatically curate high-quality training data without
human annotations or external model-based supervision. By relying solely on
self-consistency rather than external supervision, our method offers a scalable
and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled
data. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, i.e., AMBER,
MultiObject-Hal (ROPE), Object HalBench, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrate
significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability. Moreover, our
approach maintains robust instruction-following ability, as evidenced by
enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TATTOO, a training-free aesthetic-aware outfit recommendation system using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for better compatibility and aesthetics in fashion e-commerce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve fashion outfit recommendations using a training-free methodology, avoiding the need for expensive labeled datasets and combining aesthetic guidance with multimodal data.

Method: TATTOO utilizes MLLMs for generating item descriptions, extracts structured aesthetic profiles of clothing images, and dynamically fuses visual and textual representations for ranking candidate items in a shared embedding space.

Result: The proposed method outperformed existing training-based techniques in both aesthetic-aware recommendations and zero-shot retrieval, validated on Aesthetic-100 and Polyvore datasets.

Conclusion: TATTOO demonstrates the potential of training-free paradigms in fashion recommendation systems by enhancing aesthetic awareness and simplifying the pipeline while achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: The global fashion e-commerce market relies significantly on intelligent and
aesthetic-aware outfit-completion tools to promote sales. While previous
studies have approached the problem of fashion outfit-completion and
compatible-item retrieval, most of them require expensive, task-specific
training on large-scale labeled data, and no effort is made to guide outfit
recommendation with explicit human aesthetics. In the era of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), we show that the conventional training-based pipeline
could be streamlined to a training-free paradigm, with better recommendation
scores and enhanced aesthetic awareness. We achieve this with TATTOO, a
Training-free AesTheTic-aware Outfit recommendation approach. It first
generates a target-item description using MLLMs, followed by an aesthetic
chain-of-thought used to distill the images into a structured aesthetic profile
including color, style, occasion, season, material, and balance. By fusing the
visual summary of the outfit with the textual description and aesthetics
vectors using a dynamic entropy-gated mechanism, candidate items can be
represented in a shared embedding space and be ranked accordingly. Experiments
on a real-world evaluation set Aesthetic-100 show that TATTOO achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared with existing training-based methods.
Another standard Polyvore dataset is also used to measure the advanced
zero-shot retrieval capability of our training-free method.

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenge of limited datasets and suboptimal driving simulator representation in thermal imaging for ADAS by using RGB-to-thermal image translation. A new framework, with CoAdaIN, enables one-to-many mappings for diverse and realistic outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges faced in thermal imaging used in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems due to limited data and limited representation in simulators.

Method: The authors propose a multi-modal RGB-to-thermal image translation framework that uses Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN), which adapts styles for individual image components rather than globally.

Result: The proposed method results in more realistic and diverse thermal image translations.

Conclusion: The CoAdaIN-enhanced framework advances thermal imaging for ADAS, ensuring improved viability for real-life applications by providing varied and accurate image translations.

Abstract: Thermal imaging in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) improves road
safety with superior perception in low-light and harsh weather conditions
compared to traditional RGB cameras. However, research in this area faces
challenges due to limited dataset availability and poor representation in
driving simulators. RGB-to-thermal image translation offers a potential
solution, but existing methods focus on one-to-one mappings. We propose a
one-to-many mapping using a multi-modal translation framework enhanced with our
Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN). Unlike the original
AdaIN, which applies styles globally, CoAdaIN adapts styles to different image
components individually. The result, as we show, is more realistic and diverse
thermal image translations. This is the accepted author manuscript of the paper

Motivation: The authors aim to develop a privacy-preserving, robust, and efficient alternative to camera-based Human Activity Recognition using LiDAR point clouds.

Method: Each LiDAR frame is converted into a proximity graph, and its Laplacian spectrum is analyzed to extract pose descriptors. Temporal statistics provide fixed vectors for classification using support vector machines and random forests.

Result: The proposed method achieves 94.4% accuracy on a 13-class rehabilitation set and 90.3% accuracy on all 27 activities in the MM-Fi dataset, outperforming skeleton-based baselines.

Conclusion: The method offers a compact, interpretable feature set derived from point cloud geometry, presenting a valid alternative to deep learning approaches for accurate and efficient Human Activity Recognition.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition supports applications in healthcare,
manufacturing, and human-machine interaction. LiDAR point clouds offer a
privacy-preserving alternative to cameras and are robust to illumination. We
propose a HAR method based on graph spectral analysis. Each LiDAR frame is
mapped to a proximity graph (epsilon-graph) and the Laplacian spectrum is
computed. Eigenvalues and statistics of eigenvectors form pose descriptors, and
temporal statistics over sliding windows yield fixed vectors for classification
with support vector machines and random forests. On the MM-Fi dataset with 40
subjects and 27 activities, under a strict subject-independent protocol, the
method reaches 94.4% accuracy on a 13-class rehabilitation set and 90.3% on all
27 activities. It also surpasses the skeleton-based baselines reported for
MM-Fi. The contribution is a compact and interpretable feature set derived
directly from point cloud geometry that provides an accurate and efficient

TL;DR: The paper introduces OracleGS, a framework for sparse-view novel view synthesis that combines generative models for scene completion with regressive models for geometric fidelity. It achieves this by using generative 3D-aware diffusion models for scene proposals and multi-view stereo (MVS) as a validation mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: View synthesis from sparse input views is inherently challenging due to geometric ambiguities. Existing approaches have conflicts between maintaining geometric fidelity and achieving scene completion.

Method: The authors propose a 'propose-and-validate' framework called OracleGS. A pre-trained 3D diffusion model generates complete scenes, and an MVS model evaluates the fidelity of these proposals using attention maps. The uncertainty signals then guide the optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmarks such as Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic by balancing generative scene completion and multi-view geometric consistency.

Conclusion: OracleGS strikes a novel balance between generative and regressive approaches, improving the performance of sparse-view synthesis via uncertainty-guided optimization, resulting in structurally consistent and geometrically plausible outcomes.

Abstract: Sparse-view novel view synthesis is fundamentally ill-posed due to severe
geometric ambiguity. Current methods are caught in a trade-off: regressive
models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, whereas generative models can
complete scenes but often introduce structural inconsistencies. We propose
OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with
regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using
generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our
"propose-and-validate" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware
diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then
repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the
3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions
where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus
where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of
texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the
optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss.
Our approach conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric
evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible
completions in under-constrained regions, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic.

*Swaib Ilias Mazumder,Manish Kumar,Aparajita Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multimodal deep learning framework to improve high-resolution rainfall predictions in India using diverse data modalities and an attention-guided U-Net architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monsoon rainfall significantly impacts India's agriculture and climate planning, yet predicting it remains difficult due to sparse observations and regional variability.

Method: The study integrates satellite and Earth observation data into a 1 km resolution dataset and uses an attention-guided U-Net model with specialized loss functions for handling class imbalance.

Result: The proposed framework outperformed unimodal baselines and existing models, especially in predicting extreme rainfall events.

Conclusion: The work offers a scalable model, benchmark dataset, and advanced forecasting capabilities for enhancing climate resilience and advancing geospatial AI in India.

Abstract: Accurate monsoon rainfall prediction is vital for India's agriculture, water
management, and climate risk planning, yet remains challenging due to sparse
ground observations and complex regional variability. We present a multimodal
deep learning framework for high-resolution precipitation classification that
leverages satellite and Earth observation data. Unlike previous rainfall
prediction models based on coarse 5-50 km grids, we curate a new 1 km
resolution dataset for five Indian states, integrating seven key geospatial
modalities: land surface temperature, vegetation (NDVI), soil moisture,
relative humidity, wind speed, elevation, and land use, covering the
June-September 2024 monsoon season. Our approach uses an attention-guided U-Net
architecture to capture spatial patterns and temporal dependencies across
modalities, combined with focal and dice loss functions to handle rainfall
class imbalance defined by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
Experiments demonstrate that our multimodal framework consistently outperforms
unimodal baselines and existing deep learning methods, especially in extreme
rainfall categories. This work contributes a scalable framework, benchmark
dataset, and state-of-the-art results for regional monsoon forecasting, climate
resilience, and geospatial AI applications in India.

TL;DR: SynDoc is a framework designed to improve domain-specific Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) by overcoming limitations of existing methods through synthetic data generation and adaptive instruction tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for efficient and accurate understanding of visually rich documents in domains like medicine, finance, and material science, where conventional LLMs/MLLMs struggle with hallucinations and inadequate domain adaptation.

Method: SynDoc uses a combination of discriminative and generative models, leveraging synthetic data generation, structural information extraction, domain-specific query generation, adaptive instruction tuning, and recursive inferencing processes.

Result: The framework achieves scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding, improving predictions for key information extraction tasks in domain-specific settings.

Conclusion: SynDoc effectively bridges the gap between domain-specific adaptation and general world knowledge, solving challenges in document understanding for professional fields.

Abstract: Domain-specific Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) presents
significant challenges due to the complexity and sensitivity of documents in
fields such as medicine, finance, and material science. Existing Large
(Multimodal) Language Models (LLMs/MLLMs) achieve promising results but face
limitations such as hallucinations, inadequate domain adaptation, and reliance
on extensive fine-tuning datasets. This paper introduces SynDoc, a novel
framework that combines discriminative and generative models to address these
challenges. SynDoc employs a robust synthetic data generation workflow, using
structural information extraction and domain-specific query generation to
produce high-quality annotations. Through adaptive instruction tuning, SynDoc
improves the discriminative model's ability to extract domain-specific
knowledge. At the same time, a recursive inferencing mechanism iteratively
refines the output of both models for stable and accurate predictions. This
framework demonstrates scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding
and bridges the gap between domain-specific adaptation and general world
knowledge for document key information extraction tasks.

*Rohit Chowdhury,Aniruddha Bala,Rohan Jaiswal,Siddharth Roheda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Vid-Freeze, an adversarial attack method to block malicious motion synthesis in image-to-video models by disrupting their attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The misuse of image-to-video generation models poses risks such as deceptive or harmful video creation, necessitating more robust protective methods.

Method: Vid-Freeze applies adversarial perturbations targeting the attention mechanisms within image-to-video generation models to prevent motion synthesis without affecting image semantics.

Result: Experiments show Vid-Freeze effectively generates static or near-static videos from protected images, offering significant defense against I2V model misuse.

Conclusion: Attention-targeting methods like Vid-Freeze provide a promising and proactive defense mechanism to mitigate risks associated with malicious content generation in I2V models.

Abstract: The rapid progress of image-to-video (I2V) generation models has introduced
significant risks, enabling video synthesis from static images and facilitating
deceptive or malicious content creation. While prior defenses such as I2VGuard
attempt to immunize images, effective and principled protection to block motion
remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vid-Freeze - a novel
attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted
adversarial perturbations to images. Our method explicitly targets the
attention mechanism of I2V models, completely disrupting motion synthesis while
preserving semantic fidelity of the input image. The resulting immunized images
generate stand-still or near-static videos, effectively blocking malicious
content creation. Our experiments demonstrate the impressive protection
provided by the proposed approach, highlighting the importance of attention
attacks as a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against
misuse of I2V generation models.

### [412] [Seeing Through the Blur: Unlocking Defocus Maps for Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23289)
*Minsun Jeon,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a new method to detect deepfakes using defocus blur analysis, leveraging its physical and optical properties to distinguish authentic images from synthetic ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing prevalence of photorealistic deepfakes and AI-generated content has raised concerns about the integrity of visual media, necessitating effective detection methods.

Method: The authors propose a physically interpretable deepfake detection framework by analyzing defocus blur—a depth-dependent, optical phenomenon absent in synthetic images. They develop defocus blur maps as forensic tools to detect discrepancies.

Result: Experimental findings support the effectiveness of defocus blur maps as robust, interpretable, and generalizable forensic cues for identifying AI-generated content.

Conclusion: The proposed defocus-based framework provides a new and interpretable method of detecting deepfakes, advancing the research and approaches in media forensics through optical principles.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the mass production of
photorealistic synthetic images, blurring the boundary between authentic and
fabricated visual content. This challenge is particularly evident in deepfake
scenarios involving facial manipulation, but also extends to broader
AI-generated content (AIGC) cases involving fully synthesized scenes. As such
content becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality, the
integrity of visual media is under threat. To address this issue, we propose a
physically interpretable deepfake detection framework and demonstrate that
defocus blur can serve as an effective forensic signal. Defocus blur is a
depth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured
images due to lens focus and scene geometry. In contrast, synthetic images
often lack realistic depth-of-field (DoF) characteristics. To capture these
discrepancies, we construct a defocus blur map and use it as a discriminative
feature for detecting manipulated content. Unlike RGB textures or
frequency-domain signals, defocus blur arises universally from optical imaging
principles and encodes physical scene structure. This makes it a robust and
generalizable forensic cue. Our approach is supported by three in-depth feature
analyses, and experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a
reliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images. We aim for our
defocus-based detection pipeline and interpretability tools to contribute
meaningfully to ongoing research in media forensics. The implementation is

TL;DR: Diff-SPK is introduced as the first diffusion-based reconstruction method designed for spike cameras, aimed at improving reconstruction in low-light high-speed scenarios by using generative priors and customized features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spike cameras have high temporal resolution but struggle in low-light, high-speed scenarios due to noise and sparse data, requiring better reconstruction methods.

Method: Diff-SPK incorporates Enhanced Texture from Inter-spike Interval (ETFI), uses ControlNet for scene generation, and integrates an ETFI-based feature fusion module.

Result: Diff-SPK significantly outperforms existing methods on low-light spike streams, demonstrated by its superior performance and benchmark results.

Conclusion: Diff-SPK advances the ability to reconstruct spike stream data in challenging conditions, providing improved visual outputs and establishing a new benchmark dataset.

Abstract: Spike camera, a type of neuromorphic sensor with high-temporal resolution,
shows great promise for high-speed visual tasks. Unlike traditional cameras,
spike camera continuously accumulates photons and fires asynchronous spike
streams. Due to unique data modality, spike streams require reconstruction
methods to become perceptible to the human eye.
  However, lots of methods struggle to handle spike streams in low-light
high-speed scenarios due to severe noise and sparse information. In this work,
we propose Diff-SPK, the first diffusion-based reconstruction method for spike
camera. Diff-SPK effectively leverages generative priors to supplement texture
information in low-light conditions. Specifically, it first employs an
\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{T}exture \textbf{f}rom Inter-spike \textbf{I}nterval
(ETFI) to aggregate sparse information from low-light spike streams. Then, ETFI
serves as a conditioning input for ControlNet to generate the high-speed
scenes. To improve the quality of results, we introduce an ETFI-based feature
fusion module during the generation process.
  Moreover, we establish the first bona fide benchmark for the low-light spike
stream reconstruction task. It significantly surpasses existing reconstruction
datasets in scale and provides quantitative illumination information. The
performance on real low-light spike streams demonstrates the superiority of
Diff-SPK.

*Hao Liu,Yongjie Zheng,Yuhan Kang,Mingyang Zhang,Maoguo Gong,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Balanced Diffusion-Guided Fusion (BDGF) framework that uses multimodal diffusion features to enhance land-cover classification accuracy with a novel adaptive modality masking and mutual learning strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address modality imbalance and improve the extraction of complementary multimodal features in the context of multimodal remote sensing data processing.

Method: The paper proposes an adaptive modality masking strategy to balance multimodal distributions in denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). It further employs CNN, Mamba, and transformer networks integrated through group channel attention and cross-attention mechanisms. A mutual learning strategy is used to encourage collaborations between these branches.

Result: The BDGF framework outperformed existing methods in land-cover classification tasks, as evidenced by extensive experiments conducted on four multimodal remote sensing datasets.

Conclusion: The balanced diffusion-guided technique successfully integrates spatial, spectral, and structural information, effectively addressing modality imbalance and improving classification performance in multimodal remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Deep learning-based techniques for the analysis of multimodal remote sensing
data have become popular due to their ability to effectively integrate
complementary spatial, spectral, and structural information from different
sensors. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have
attracted attention in the remote sensing community due to their powerful
ability to capture robust and complex spatial-spectral distributions. However,
pre-training multimodal DDPMs may result in modality imbalance, and effectively
leveraging diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature
extraction remains an open question. To address these issues, this paper
proposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that leverages
multimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover
classification. Specifically, we propose an adaptive modality masking strategy
to encourage the DDPMs to obtain a modality-balanced rather than spectral
image-dominated data distribution. Subsequently, these diffusion features
hierarchically guide feature extraction among CNN, Mamba, and transformer
networks by integrating feature fusion, group channel attention, and
cross-attention mechanisms. Finally, a mutual learning strategy is developed to
enhance inter-branch collaboration by aligning the probability entropy and
feature similarity of individual subnetworks. Extensive experiments on four
multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior classification performance. The code is available at

TL;DR: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with cultural imagery, misclassifying emergencies and underrepresented traditions due to superficial pattern recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacies of VLMs in understanding culturally nuanced imagery and reduce risks associated with misclassification.

Method: Developed a diagnostic framework testing VLMs on classification and explanation analysis, focusing on fire-themed cultural imagery.

Result: Observed systematic biases with correct identification of Western festivals but failures in non-Western traditions and emergency representations.

Conclusion: VLMs require cultural evaluations beyond accuracy metrics to ensure their fairness and interpretability in diverse contexts.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often appear culturally competent but rely on
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding. We
introduce a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural
imagery through both classification and explanation analysis. Testing multiple
models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes
reveals systematic biases: models correctly identify prominent Western
festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently
offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as
celebrations. These failures expose the risks of symbolic shortcuts and
highlight the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure
interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces C3-OWD, a unified framework addressing robustness and generalization challenges in object detection by leveraging curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap between robustness to adverse conditions and generalization to unseen categories in real-world object detection applications.

Method: The proposed framework consists of two stages: Stage 1 focuses on robustness via RGBT data pretraining, and Stage 2 enhances generalization through vision-language alignment. An EMA mechanism ensures no catastrophic forgetting between stages.

Result: C3-OWD shows competitive results across various benchmarks: 80.1 AP$^{50}$ on FLIR, 48.6 AP$^{50}_{\text{Novel}}$ on OV-COCO, and 35.7 mAP$_r$ on OV-LVIS.

Conclusion: C3-OWD successfully addresses the trade-off between robustness and generalization, providing a promising solution for open-world object detection in challenging environments.

Abstract: Object detection has advanced significantly in the closed-set setting, but
real-world deployment remains limited by two challenges: poor generalization to
unseen categories and insufficient robustness under adverse conditions. Prior
research has explored these issues separately: visible-infrared detection
improves robustness but lacks generalization, while open-world detection
leverages vision-language alignment strategy for category diversity but
struggles under extreme environments. This trade-off leaves robustness and
diversity difficult to achieve simultaneously. To mitigate these issues, we
propose \textbf{C3-OWD}, a curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning
framework that unifies both strengths. Stage~1 enhances robustness by
pretraining with RGBT data, while Stage~2 improves generalization via
vision-language alignment. To prevent catastrophic forgetting between two
stages, we introduce an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) mechanism that
theoretically guarantees preservation of pre-stage performance with bounded
parameter lag and function consistency. Experiments on FLIR, OV-COCO, and
OV-LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: C3-OWD achieves $80.1$
AP$^{50}$ on FLIR, $48.6$ AP$^{50}_{\text{Novel}}$ on OV-COCO, and $35.7$
mAP$_r$ on OV-LVIS, establishing competitive performance across both robustness
and diversity evaluations. Code available at:

TL;DR: The paper develops S2BNet, a binary neural network designed for efficient remote sensing pansharpening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To decrease the computational complexity of deep neural networks in pansharpening, enabling use on resource-limited devices.

Method: The paper introduces S2B-Conv, composed of two modules: SRM (Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism) for handling spectral distortion via affine transformation and GSFA (Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier) for improving spatial features. These components integrate into the S2BNet architecture.

Result: The method achieves promising performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, proving its high efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The customized spatial-spectral methods make binary neural networks practical for pansharpening tasks while maintaining performance and reducing complexity.

Abstract: Remote sensing pansharpening aims to reconstruct spatial-spectral properties
during the fusion of panchromatic (PAN) images and low-resolution
multi-spectral (LR-MS) images, finally generating the high-resolution
multi-spectral (HR-MS) images. Although deep learning-based models have
achieved excellent performance, they often come with high computational
complexity, which hinder their applications on resource-limited devices. In
this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying the binary neural network
(BNN) to pan-sharpening. Nevertheless, there are two main issues with
binarizing pan-sharpening models: (i) the binarization will cause serious
spectral distortion due to the inconsistent spectral distribution of the
PAN/LR-MS images; (ii) the common binary convolution kernel is difficult to
adapt to the multi-scale and anisotropic spatial features of remote sensing
objects, resulting in serious degradation of contours. To address the above
issues, we design the customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution
(S2B-Conv), which is composed of the Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM)
and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA). Specifically, SRM employs an affine
transformation, generating its scaling and bias parameters through a dynamic
learning process. GSFA, which randomly selects different frequencies and angles
within a preset range, enables to better handle multi-scale and-directional
spatial features. A series of S2B-Conv form a brand-new binary network for
pan-sharpening, dubbed as S2BNet. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments have shown our high-efficiency binarized pan-sharpening method can
attain a promising performance.

*Hongrui Jia,Chaoya Jiang,Shikun Zhang,Wei Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a training-free visual-reasoning pipeline to improve Large Multimodal Models’ (LMMs) reasoning fidelity by decoupling reasoning and perception processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge that LMMs lose visual grounding during extended reasoning chains, leading to errors.

Method: The method uses a Large Language Model (LLM) for reasoning while delegating visual perception tasks to an LMM, functioning as a visual question-answering engine.

Result: The proposed framework reduces visually-unfounded reasoning steps and enhances reasoning fidelity.

Conclusion: The lightweight plug-and-play approach improves visual reasoning without requiring additional training or architectural changes.

Abstract: Significant advancements in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) are now driven by test-time scaling laws, particularly those
leveraging extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Inspired by these
breakthroughs, researchers have extended these paradigms to Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs). However, a critical limitation emerges: as their reasoning
chains extend, LMMs increasingly rely on textual logic, progressively losing
grounding in the underlying visual information. This leads to reasoning paths
that diverge from the image content, culminating in erroneous conclusions. To
address this, we introduce a strikingly simple yet effective training-free
visual-reasoning pipeline. The core concept is to decouple the reasoning and
perception processes. A powerful LLM orchestrates the high-level reasoning,
strategically interrogating a LMM to extract specific visual information
required for its logical chain. The LMM, in turn, functions exclusively as a
visual question-answering engine, supplying the necessary perceptual details on
demand. This lightweight, plug-and-play approach requires no additional
training or architectural changes. Comprehensive evaluations validate that our
framework effectively governs the visual reasoning process, leading to a
significant reduction in visually-unfounded reasoning steps and a substantial
improvement in reasoning fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP), a method for multi-label class-incremental learning (MLCIL) that addresses semantic confusion and true-negative-false-positive confusion, achieving improved performance without using replay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in extending prompt-based single-label class-incremental learning to multi-label scenarios, particularly concerning semantic confusion and false positives due to partial labeling.

Method: The proposed method, DDP, uses class-specific positive-negative prompts for semantic disentanglement, Progressive Confidence Decoupling (PCD) to suppress false positives, frozen past prompts as knowledge anchors, and interlayer prompting for efficiency.

Result: DDP demonstrates superior performance on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC benchmarks, surpassing prior methods and achieving over 80% mean average precision (mAP) and 70% F1 score on a standard benchmark.

Conclusion: DDP represents a significant advancement in MLCIL, offering a replay-free, parameter-efficient approach that effectively overcomes key challenges and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have shown strong effectiveness in single-label
class-incremental learning, but their direct extension to multi-label
class-incremental learning (MLCIL) performs poorly due to two intrinsic
challenges: semantic confusion from co-occurring categories and
true-negative-false-positive confusion caused by partial labeling. We propose
Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP), a replay-free and parameter-efficient framework
that explicitly addresses both issues. DDP assigns class-specific
positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and introduces Progressive
Confidence Decoupling (PCD), a curriculum-inspired decoupling strategy that
suppresses false positives. Past prompts are frozen as knowledge anchors, and
interlayer prompting enhances efficiency. On MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, DDP
consistently outperforms prior methods and is the first replay-free MLCIL
approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10
benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve artifacts like missing details and identity ambiguity in Blind Face Restoration due to its large solution space.

Method: The authors propose LRPO, employing online reinforcement learning with a composite reward function, likelihood regularization, and noise-level advantage assignment.

Result: LRPO enhances restoration quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in face restoration tasks.

Conclusion: Applying RL with tailored strategies to BFR improves perceptual quality and restoration fidelity, resolving prior restoration challenges effectively.

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration (BFR) encounters inherent challenges in exploring its
large solution space, leading to common artifacts like missing details and
identity ambiguity in the restored images. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a Likelihood-Regularized Policy Optimization (LRPO) framework, the
first to apply online reinforcement learning (RL) to the BFR task. LRPO
leverages rewards from sampled candidates to refine the policy network,
increasing the likelihood of high-quality outputs while improving restoration
performance on low-quality inputs. However, directly applying RL to BFR creates
incompatibility issues, producing restoration results that deviate
significantly from the ground truth. To balance perceptual quality and
fidelity, we propose three key strategies: 1) a composite reward function
tailored for face restoration assessment, 2) ground-truth guided likelihood
regularization, and 3) noise-level advantage assignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed LRPO significantly improves the face restoration
quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DentVLM, a vision-language model for multimodal oral disease diagnosis, showing superior accuracy and practical applications in dentistry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI models struggle with complex multimodal tasks required in clinical dental practice.

Method: DentVLM was trained on a large dataset, including images and VQA pairs, and evaluated across multiple diagnostic tasks and imaging modalities.

Result: It outperformed proprietary and open-source models, aided dentists in diagnostic tasks, and demonstrated efficiency in clinical scenarios.

Conclusion: DentVLM enhances dental diagnosis outcomes, speeds up practitioner workflow, and democratizes access to specialized dental care.

Abstract: Diagnosing and managing oral diseases necessitate advanced visual
interpretation across diverse imaging modalities and integrated information
synthesis. While current AI models excel at isolated tasks, they often fall
short in addressing the complex, multimodal requirements of comprehensive
clinical dental practice. Here we introduce DentVLM, a multimodal
vision-language model engineered for expert-level oral disease diagnosis.
DentVLM was developed using a comprehensive, large-scale, bilingual dataset of
110,447 images and 2.46 million visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. The
model is capable of interpreting seven 2D oral imaging modalities across 36
diagnostic tasks, significantly outperforming leading proprietary and
open-source models by 19.6% higher accuracy for oral diseases and 27.9% for
malocclusions. In a clinical study involving 25 dentists, evaluating 1,946
patients and encompassing 3,105 QA pairs, DentVLM surpassed the diagnostic
performance of 13 junior dentists on 21 of 36 tasks and exceeded that of 12
senior dentists on 12 of 36 tasks. When integrated into a collaborative
workflow, DentVLM elevated junior dentists' performance to senior levels and
reduced diagnostic time for all practitioners by 15-22%. Furthermore, DentVLM
exhibited promising performance across three practical utility scenarios,
including home-based dental health management, hospital-based intelligent
diagnosis and multi-agent collaborative interaction. These findings establish
DentVLM as a robust clinical decision support tool, poised to enhance primary
dental care, mitigate provider-patient imbalances, and democratize access to
specialized medical expertise within the field of dentistry.

It also integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with RL in the LayerTuning-RL paradigm.

Result: The model demonstrates significant improvements in semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and human preference alignment, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 4.9%, 5.91%, and 8.66% on benchmarks. Training efficiency improved by nearly 50%.

Conclusion: Dynamic-TreeRPO with LayerTuning-RL resolves inefficiencies in T2I generation by efficiently exploring diverse search spaces, achieving superior results while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for
text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation
quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration
and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling
group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements
the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic
noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and
constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree
structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively
amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed
noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the
variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we
seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within
Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the
loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM)
rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM
with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in
Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and
the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search
space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach
demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual
fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including
HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA
by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while
improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.

### [423] [Test-time Uncertainty Estimation for Medical Image Registration via Transformation Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23355)
*Lin Tian,Xiaoling Hu,Juan Eugenio Iglesias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a test-time uncertainty estimation framework for image registration networks that leverages transformation equivariance without requiring retraining, providing reliable predictions on pretrained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep registration networks lack reliable uncertainty estimation methods compatible with pretrained models, limiting their safety and reliability in clinical or research settings.

Method: The proposed framework uses the transformation equivariance property of registration, applying input spatial perturbations and analyzing prediction variances. It provides a decomposition of uncertainty into intrinsic spread (epistemic noise) and bias jitter (systematic error drift).

Result: The framework demonstrates effectiveness across four anatomical structures and multiple registration models by accurately correlating uncertainty maps with registration errors and signaling regions that require caution.

Conclusion: Test-time uncertainty estimation enables pretrained registration networks to become risk-aware tools, improving their safety for deployment in medical and large-scale research applications.

Abstract: Accurate image registration is essential for downstream applications, yet
current deep registration networks provide limited indications of whether and
when their predictions are reliable. Existing uncertainty estimation
strategies, such as Bayesian methods, ensembles, or MC dropout, require
architectural changes or retraining, limiting their applicability to pretrained
registration networks. Instead, we propose a test-time uncertainty estimation
framework that is compatible with any pretrained networks. Our framework is
grounded in the transformation equivariance property of registration, which
states that the true mapping between two images should remain consistent under
spatial perturbations of the input. By analyzing the variance of network
predictions under such perturbations, we derive a theoretical decomposition of
perturbation-based uncertainty in registration. This decomposition separates
into two terms: (i) an intrinsic spread, reflecting epistemic noise, and (ii) a
bias jitter, capturing how systematic error drifts under perturbations. Across
four anatomical structures (brain, cardiac, abdominal, and lung) and multiple
registration models (uniGradICON, SynthMorph), the uncertainty maps correlate
consistently with registration errors and highlight regions requiring caution.
Our framework turns any pretrained registration network into a risk-aware tool
at test time, placing medical image registration one step closer to safe
deployment in clinical and large-scale research settings.

### [424] [GRAPE: Let GPRO Supervise Query Rewriting by Ranking for Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23370)
*Zhaohua Zhang,Jianhuan Zhuo,Muxi Chen,Chenchen Zhao,Wenyu Jiang,Tianwen Jiang,Mingyang Chen,Yu Tang,Qiuyong Xiao,Jihong Zhang,Zhixun Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP struggles with input distribution divergences in text-image retrieval tasks. GRAPE addresses these issues by enhancing query rewriting through ranking-guided optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP faces challenges with queries having multilingual, long-form, or multimodal differences due to distribution gaps. Existing query-rewriting methods are unsupervised and ineffective for alignment.

Method: GRAPE employs a ranking-based reward mechanism to enhance query rewriting for CLIP. Using GRPO, queries are transformed to align better with the training distribution. A corpus-relative ranking model avoids score inflation in optimization.

Result: GRAPE improves retrieval performance under various distributional shifts, achieving a 4.9% average improvement in Recall@10 across datasets including Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600, Wikipedia, and CIRR.

Conclusion: GRAPE is an effective, plug-and-play solution for optimizing query rewriting in CLIP-based systems, reliably addressing distributional shifts and improving retrieval outcomes.

Abstract: The CLIP model has become a cornerstone of large-scale retrieval systems by
aligning text and image data in a unified embedding space. Despite its
simplicity and efficiency, CLIP struggles when applied to tasks whose input
distributions diverge from its training corpus, such as queries with
multilingual, long-form, or multimodal differences. To avoid costly retraining,
existing methods mainly adopt query-rewriting strategies with large language
models (LLMs), aiming to mitigate distribution gaps at the query level.
However, due to the lack of supervision signals, LLMs fail to generate the
optimal one that fits the training distribution. We address this challenge with
GRAPE (Grouped Ranking-Aware Policy Optimization Enhancement), a plug-and-play
enhancement approach that incorporates ranking signals into retrieval-guided
query rewriting with LLMs. Intuitively, GRAPE proposes to leverage GRPO to
bridge distributional differences -- including length, multilingual, and
modality shifts -- by transforming queries into forms better aligned with the
retriever's training distribution. However, our preliminary experiment finds
that naively finetuning LLM with similarity scores can lead to score inflation,
where nearly all candidates are assigned unexpectedly high scores regardless of
their true relevance. To address score inflation, we propose a corpus-relative
ranking-based reward, which explicitly aligns optimization with ranking metrics
while suppressing spurious score inflation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that GRAPE consistently improves retrieval performance under distributional
shifts -- including multilingual differences (Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600),
length differences (Wikipedia), and multimodal differences (CIRR) -- achieving
an average improvement of 4.9\% in Recall\@10. The code is available at

*Yifan Yang,Yuxiang Yan,Boda Liu,Jian Pu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CasPoinTr introduces a two-stage framework for point cloud completion using cascaded networks and knowledge distillation, significantly improving shape recovery and detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point clouds from real-world data are often incomplete due to sensor limitations, occlusions, or noise, making completion critical for applications.

Method: The paper proposes a two-stage framework: Shape Reconstruction to generate auxiliary data and Fused Completion using knowledge distillation from teacher models trained on dense clouds to student models.

Result: Experiments on ShapeNet-55 show that CasPoinTr surpasses current methods in recovering overall shapes and refining local details.

Conclusion: CasPoinTr successfully bridges the gap between incomplete inputs and complete targets, offering an effective solution for point cloud challenges.

Abstract: Point clouds collected from real-world environments are often incomplete due
to factors such as limited sensor resolution, single viewpoints, occlusions,
and noise. These challenges make point cloud completion essential for various
applications. A key difficulty in this task is predicting the overall shape and
reconstructing missing regions from highly incomplete point clouds. To address
this, we introduce CasPoinTr, a novel point cloud completion framework using
cascaded networks and knowledge distillation. CasPoinTr decomposes the
completion task into two synergistic stages: Shape Reconstruction, which
generates auxiliary information, and Fused Completion, which leverages this
information alongside knowledge distillation to generate the final output.
Through knowledge distillation, a teacher model trained on denser point clouds
transfers incomplete-complete associative knowledge to the student model,
enhancing its ability to estimate the overall shape and predict missing
regions. Together, the cascaded networks and knowledge distillation enhance the
model's ability to capture global shape context while refining local details,
effectively bridging the gap between incomplete inputs and complete targets.
Experiments on ShapeNet-55 under different difficulty settings demonstrate that
CasPoinTr outperforms existing methods in shape recovery and detail
preservation, highlighting the effectiveness of our cascaded structure and
distillation strategy.

*Jinghong Zheng,Changlong Jiang,Jiaqi Li,Haohong Kuang,Hang Xu,Tingbing Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniPose for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation using unannotated RGB-D sequences, bridging 2D and 3D pose estimation gaps and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges in 3D human pose estimation, specifically minimizing dependence on labor-intensive 3D annotations and overcoming issues like multi-view camera calibration and synthetic-to-real data shifts.

Method: UniPose uses self-supervised learning to transfer 2D pose annotations from large-scale datasets to 3D via RGB-D data. Its training incorporates spatial-temporal constraints, 2D-to-3D back-projection loss, and cross-modality interaction.

Result: UniPose achieves performance comparable to fully supervised methods on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets and shows improved results leveraging large-scale unlabeled data.

Conclusion: UniPose provides a practical, efficient solution for 3D HPE by eliminating the need for major resources like 3D annotations and showing robustness against 2D pose estimation inaccuracies.

Abstract: In this paper, we present UniPose, a unified cross-modality pose prior
propagation method for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation (HPE) using
unannotated single-view RGB-D sequences (RGB, depth, and point cloud data).
UniPose transfers 2D HPE annotations from large-scale RGB datasets (e.g., MS
COCO) to the 3D domain via self-supervised learning on easily acquired RGB-D
sequences, eliminating the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations.
This approach bridges the gap between 2D and 3D domains without suffering from
issues related to multi-view camera calibration or synthetic-to-real data
shifts. During training, UniPose leverages off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as
weak supervision for point cloud networks, incorporating spatial-temporal
constraints like body symmetry and joint motion. The 2D-to-3D back-projection
loss and cross-modality interaction further enhance this process. By treating
the point cloud network's 3D HPE results as pseudo ground truth, our
anchor-to-joint prediction method performs 3D lifting on RGB and depth
networks, making it more robust against inaccuracies in 2D HPE results compared
to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets show
that UniPose achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods.
Incorporating large-scale unlabeled data (e.g., NTU RGB+D 60) enhances its
performance under challenging conditions, demonstrating its potential for
practical applications. Our proposed 3D lifting method also achieves
state-of-the-art results.

*Takehiko Ohkawa,Jihyun Lee,Shunsuke Saito,Jason Saragih,Fabian Prado,Yichen Xu,Shoou-I Yu,Ryosuke Furuta,Yoichi Sato,Takaaki Shiratori*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Goliath-SC, a dataset of self-contact poses accounting for body shapes, and proposes a method for modeling and estimating these poses more accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-contact datasets lack diversity in poses and precise body shape representations, limiting the analysis of the interplay between self-contact poses and body shapes.

Method: The researchers present Goliath-SC, a dataset with 383K self-contact poses across 130 subjects, and propose a body-part-wise latent diffusion model with self-attention, conditioned on body shape parameters.

Result: The proposed method shows that shape-conditioned modeling is crucial for successful representation of self-contact poses and improves single-view human pose estimation.

Conclusion: Incorporating body shape information significantly enhances the modeling and estimation of self-contact poses, demonstrating the importance of shape-conditional frameworks for these tasks.

Abstract: One can hardly model self-contact of human poses without considering
underlying body shapes. For example, the pose of rubbing a belly for a person
with a low BMI leads to penetration of the hand into the belly for a person
with a high BMI. Despite its relevance, existing self-contact datasets lack the
variety of self-contact poses and precise body shapes, limiting conclusive
analysis between self-contact poses and shapes. To address this, we begin by
introducing the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape
registration, Goliath-SC, consisting of 383K self-contact poses across 130
subjects. Using this dataset, we propose generative modeling of self-contact
prior conditioned by body shape parameters, based on a body-part-wise latent
diffusion with self-attention. We further incorporate this prior into
single-view human pose estimation while refining estimated poses to be in
contact. Our experiments suggest that shape conditioning is vital to the
successful modeling of self-contact pose distribution, hence improving
single-view pose estimation in self-contact.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WorldSplat, a framework for generating high-fidelity, consistent 4D driving-scene videos using latent diffusion and video refinement methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing driving-scene generation methods in producing 3D-consistent novel-view synthesis, and overcome the lack of generative capabilities in reconstruction approaches.

Method: WorldSplat uses a 4D-aware latent diffusion model to create pixel-aligned Gaussians and an enhanced video diffusion model to refine novel-view videos.

Result: WorldSplat demonstrates high-quality generation of consistent multi-track videos, verified via extensive experiments on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed WorldSplat successfully bridges the gap between scene generation and reconstruction, enhancing driving video synthesis for autonomous systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in driving-scene generation and reconstruction have
demonstrated significant potential for enhancing autonomous driving systems by
producing scalable and controllable training data. Existing generation methods
primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos;
however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they
struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS).
Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved
NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities.
To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we
propose \textbf{WorldSplat}, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D
driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent
multi-track videos through two key steps: ((i)) We introduce a 4D-aware latent
diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D
Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. ((ii)) Subsequently, we refine the novel
view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion
model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
\textbf{WorldSplat} effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and
spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.

Conclusion: Fracture-YOLO leverages advanced deep learning techniques to enhance fracture detection, outperforming traditional methods and baseline YOLO models, and achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Fracture detection plays a critical role in medical imaging analysis,
traditional fracture diagnosis relies on visual assessment by experienced

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve diagnostic efficiency in clinical practice by addressing challenges in medical imaging, specifically the accurate detection of subtle and diverse fractures.

Method: FracDetNet integrates Dual-Focus Attention for capturing both global and local features and Multi-scale Calibration for refining feature representation, ensuring enhanced detection performance.

Result: FracDetNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset, achieving a mAP$_{50-95}$ of 40.0% (7.5% improvement) and mAP$_{50}$ of 63.9% (4.2% improvement), along with enhanced fracture-specific detection accuracy (+2.9%).

Conclusion: The proposed framework not only addresses limitations of existing methods in detecting challenging fractures but also sets a new benchmark for fracture detection in medical imaging.

Abstract: In this paper, an advanced fracture detection framework, FracDetNet, is
proposed to address challenges in medical imaging, as accurate fracture
detection is essential for enhancing diagnostic efficiency in clinical
practice. Despite recent advancements, existing methods still struggle with
detecting subtle and morphologically diverse fractures due to variable imaging
angles and suboptimal image quality. To overcome these limitations, FracDetNet
integrates Dual-Focus Attention (DFA) and Multi-scale Calibration (MC).
Specifically, the DFA module effectively captures detailed local features and
comprehensive global context through combined global and local attention
mechanisms. Additionally, the MC adaptively refines feature representations to
enhance detection performance. Experimental evaluations on the publicly
available GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with
FracDetNet achieving a mAP$_{50-95}$ of 40.0\%, reflecting a \textbf{7.5\%}

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPIKE, a framework for identifying surprising moments in videos, and SPIKE-RL, which optimizes beliefs for video captioning to improve Video-LLM performance by sampling frames based on interest.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most Video-LLMs use uniform frame sampling and miss critical moments in videos that contain surprising elements, reducing their ability to narrate or understand these videos effectively.

Method: SPIKE utilizes Bayesian Surprise to localize surprising moments in videos, while SPIKE-RL leverages GRPO reinforcement learning to optimize belief hypotheses using rewards from video captions.

Result: SPIKE demonstrates strong correlation with humans in identifying surprise, and SPIKE-RL achieves performance improvements on five benchmarks over uniform sampling with its surprise-weighted strategy.

Conclusion: Tracking beliefs and registering surprise in videos enhances Video-LLMs, paving the way for models that adaptively revise understanding based on new evidence.

Abstract: Real-world videos often show routine activities punctuated by memorable,
surprising events. However, most Video-LLMs process videos by sampling frames
uniformly, likely missing critical moments that define a video's narrative. We
introduce SPIKE, an inference-time framework that quantifies Bayesian Surprise
as the belief update triggered by new visual evidence in the video stream,
identifying moments where new visual evidence conflicts with prior beliefs.
SPIKE effectively localizes surprise in videos, strongly correlated with humans
on positive (FunQA) and negative (Oops!) surprise benchmarks. Since the beliefs
of zero-shot Video-LLMs are often suboptimal, we develop SPIKE-RL, which
leverages GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on a reward signal from the
video caption. SPIKE and SPIKE-RL guide query-agnostic surprise-weighted frame
sampling, which allocates more frames to interesting moments in the video. With
this strategy, we achieve consistent performance gains on five downstream
benchmarks over uniform sampling. By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and
register surprise, our work paves the way for more robust models that can
revise their understanding in response to new information.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FM-SIREN and FM-FINER, new methods to improve implicit neural representation networks by reducing feature redundancy through Nyquist-informed frequency multipliers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of feature redundancy in existing periodic activation-based INR networks, which limits their expressive capacity.

Method: Nyquist-informed, neuron-specific frequency multipliers are assigned to periodic activations, introducing frequency diversity without adding depth or requiring hyperparameter tuning.

Result: The proposed approach reduces feature redundancy by nearly 50% and consistently outperforms baseline methods across various INR tasks, including audio fitting, image reconstruction, and NeRF synthesis.

Conclusion: FM-SIREN and FM-FINER enhance signal reconstruction effectively while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Existing periodic activation-based implicit neural representation (INR)
networks, such as SIREN and FINER, suffer from hidden feature redundancy, where
neurons within a layer capture overlapping frequency components due to the use
of a fixed frequency multiplier. This redundancy limits the expressive capacity
of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Drawing inspiration from classical signal
processing methods such as the Discrete Sine Transform (DST), we propose
FM-SIREN and FM-FINER, which assign Nyquist-informed, neuron-specific frequency
multipliers to periodic activations. Unlike existing approaches, our design
introduces frequency diversity without requiring hyperparameter tuning or
additional network depth. This simple yet principled modification reduces the
redundancy of features by nearly 50% and consistently improves signal
reconstruction across diverse INR tasks, including fitting 1D audio, 2D image
and 3D shape, and synthesis of neural radiance fields (NeRF), outperforming
their baseline counterparts while maintaining efficiency.

*Tanawan Premsri,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FoR-SALE, a method to enhance text-to-image generation models by addressing spatial reasoning using Frames of Reference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art multimodal language models underperform in text-to-image generation when spatial descriptions come from unconventional perspectives, due to the neglect of spatial reasoning concepts like the Frame of Reference.

Method: FoR-SALE evaluates the spatial alignment between text and an initially generated image, adjusts any misalignments with camera perspective mappings, and refines the image through latent-space operations for adjustments in direction and depth.

Result: FoR-SALE improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3% in spatial reasoning benchmarks after a single round of correction.

Conclusion: Incorporating spatial reasoning with Frame of Reference through the FoR-SALE framework significantly enhances the spatial alignment capabilities of existing T2I models.

Abstract: Frame of Reference (FoR) is a fundamental concept in spatial reasoning that
humans utilize to comprehend and describe space. With the rapid progress in
Multimodal Language models, the moment has come to integrate this
long-overlooked dimension into these models. In particular, in text-to-image
(T2I) generation, even state-of-the-art models exhibit a significant
performance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other
than the camera. To address this limitation, we propose Frame of
Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing (FoR-SALE),
an extension of the Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) framework
for T2I. For-Sale evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially
generated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference
specified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the
spatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial
expression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective
enables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When
misalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and
applied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing
direction and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two
benchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our
framework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3%
using only a single round of correction.

TL;DR: This paper introduces 3DPCNet, a module rectifying 3D joint coordinates into a consistent body-centered frame, improving pose alignment and motion analysis with self-supervised training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D pose estimators create camera-centered skeletons that cause view-dependent signals, complicating comparative analyses in fields like health and sports science.

Method: The module fuses graph convolutional network features with global transformer context through gated cross-attention, predicts a 6D rotation mapped to an $SO(3)$ matrix, and is self-supervised using synthetic pose rotations.

Result: 3DPCNet reduces mean rotation error from over 20$^{\circ}$ to 3.4$^{\circ}$ and Mean Per Joint Position Error from ~64 mm to 47 mm, with qualitative evaluations confirming acceleration data quality.

Conclusion: 3DPCNet effectively removes viewpoint variability, enabling physically plausible motion analysis from video data with strong alignment to ground-truth IMU sensor data.

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimators produce camera-centered skeletons, creating
view-dependent kinematic signals that complicate comparative analysis in
applications such as health and sports science. We present 3DPCNet, a compact,
estimator-agnostic module that operates directly on 3D joint coordinates to
rectify any input pose into a consistent, body-centered canonical frame. Its
hybrid encoder fuses local skeletal features from a graph convolutional network
with global context from a transformer via a gated cross-attention mechanism.
From this representation, the model predicts a continuous 6D rotation that is
mapped to an $SO(3)$ matrix to align the pose. We train the model in a
self-supervised manner on the MM-Fi dataset using synthetically rotated poses,
guided by a composite loss ensuring both accurate rotation and pose
reconstruction. On the MM-Fi benchmark, 3DPCNet reduces the mean rotation error
from over 20$^{\circ}$ to 3.4$^{\circ}$ and the Mean Per Joint Position Error
from ~64 mm to 47 mm compared to a geometric baseline. Qualitative evaluations
on the TotalCapture dataset further demonstrate that our method produces
acceleration signals from video that show strong visual correspondence to
ground-truth IMU sensor data, confirming that our module removes viewpoint
variability to enable physically plausible motion analysis.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a test-time optimization framework to enhance the faithful rendering of complex prompts in text-to-image (T2I) models by enabling fine-grained semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the common issue in T2I models of misrepresenting or omitting specific objects and attributes in complex prompts.

Method: The method involves decomposing prompts into semantic concepts, assessing alignment using fine-grained CLIP models, and iteratively refining prompts through a feedback loop with a large language model.

Result: The framework significantly improves concept coverage and compositional faithfulness on benchmarks like DrawBench and CompBench, outperforming conventional optimization methods and base T2I models.

Conclusion: A fine-grained test-time optimization is effective in improving the fidelity and semantic accuracy of T2I model outputs in response to complex prompts.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, they often fail to
faithfully render all elements of complex prompts, frequently omitting or
misrepresenting specific objects and attributes. Test-time optimization has
emerged as a promising approach to address this limitation by refining
generation without the need for retraining. In this paper, we propose a
fine-grained test-time optimization framework that enhances compositional
faithfulness in T2I generation. Unlike most of prior approaches that rely
solely on a global image/text similarity score, our method decomposes the input
prompt into semantic concepts and evaluates alignment at both the global and
concept levels. A fine-grained variant of CLIP is used to compute concept-level
correspondence, producing detailed feedback on missing or inaccurate concepts.
This feedback is fed into an iterative prompt refinement loop, enabling the
large language model to propose improved prompts. Experiments on DrawBench and
CompBench prompts demonstrate that our method significantly improves concept
coverage and human-judged faithfulness over both standard test-time
optimization and the base T2I model. Code is available at:

### [436] [Robust Multi-Modal Face Anti-Spoofing with Domain Adaptation: Tackling Missing Modalities, Noisy Pseudo-Labels, and Model Degradation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23475)
*Ming-Tsung Hsu,Fang-Yu Hsu,Yi-Ting Lin,Kai-Heng Chien,Jun-Ren Chen,Cheng-Hsiang Su,Yi-Chen Ou,Chiou-Ting Hsu,Pei-Kai Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes MFAS-DANet, a framework for multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) under domain adaptation (DA) scenarios, addressing missing modalities, noisy pseudo labels, and model degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the robustness of multi-modal FAS methods, particularly in addressing domain adaptation scenarios where unseen attack types and domain shifts occur.

Method: The framework substitutes or enhances missing modality features, derives reliable pseudo labels using prediction uncertainty across modalities, and employs an adaptive loss weighting mechanism to handle model instability during adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MFAS-DANet, showing its superiority in achieving state-of-the-art performance under domain adaptation scenarios.

Conclusion: MFAS-DANet successfully addresses challenges in multi-modal FAS under DA scenarios, enabling better generalization to unseen attacks and improving robustness even when modalities are missing or noisy.

Abstract: Recent multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have investigated the
potential of leveraging multiple modalities to distinguish live and spoof
faces. However, pre-adapted multi-modal FAS models often fail to detect unseen
attacks from new target domains. Although a more realistic domain adaptation
(DA) scenario has been proposed for single-modal FAS to learn specific spoof
attacks during inference, DA remains unexplored in multi-modal FAS methods. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, MFAS-DANet, to address three major
challenges in multi-modal FAS under the DA scenario: missing modalities, noisy
pseudo labels, and model degradation. First, to tackle the issue of missing
modalities, we propose extracting complementary features from other modalities
to substitute missing modality features or enhance existing ones. Next, to
reduce the impact of noisy pseudo labels during model adaptation, we propose
deriving reliable pseudo labels by leveraging prediction uncertainty across
different modalities. Finally, to prevent model degradation, we design an
adaptive mechanism that decreases the loss weight during unstable adaptations
and increasing it during stable ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of our proposed MFAS-DANet.

### [437] [RestoRect: Degraded Image Restoration via Latent Rectified Flow & Feature Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23480)
*Shourya Verma,Mengbo Wang,Nadia Atallah Lanman,Ananth Grama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'RestoRect,' a feature distillation method designed to improve degraded image restoration, balancing performance and speed using generative latent rectified flow methods and innovative features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image restoration methods face a trade-off between performance and speed, and current static feature matching methods fail to effectively utilize the dynamic nature of transformer-based architectures.

Method: The proposed 'RestoRect' method uses latent rectified flow to reframe feature distillation as a generative task. It incorporates Retinex theory, learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints, trigonometric color space polarization, and a Feature Layer Extraction loss with cross-normalized feature alignment to enable robust student-teacher knowledge transfer.

Result: RestoRect provides better training stability, faster convergence, quicker inference times, and improved restoration quality. It shows superior performance on 15 datasets across 4 tasks and 8 evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: RestoRect offers an advanced and efficient solution for high-quality image restoration while addressing the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation methods, making it suitable for practical deployment.

Abstract: Current approaches for restoration of degraded images face a critical
trade-off: high-performance models are too slow for practical use, while fast
models produce poor results. Knowledge distillation transfers teacher knowledge
to students, but existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how
modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features. We propose
'RestoRect', a novel Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method for
restoring degraded images. We apply rectified flow to reformulate feature
distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize
teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Our
framework combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with
learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints, and trigonometric color space
polarization. We introduce a Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge
transfer between different network architectures through cross-normalized
transformer feature alignment with percentile-based outlier detection.
RestoRect achieves better training stability, and faster convergence and
inference while preserving restoration quality. We demonstrate superior results
across 15 image restoration datasets, covering 4 tasks, on 8 metrics.

*Junyi Wu,Jiachen Tao,Haoxuan Wang,Gaowen Liu,Ramana Rao Kompella,Yan Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting (OriGS) improves 4D reconstruction of dynamic scenes from monocular videos by utilizing orientation-based guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 4D reconstruction struggle with modeling complex, region-specific deformations in unconstrained dynamics, requiring a more robust solution.

Method: OriGS employs a Global Orientation Field for structural guidance and introduces an Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian to encode time, space, geometry, and orientation into a unified probabilistic state.

Result: OriGS achieves superior reconstruction fidelity compared to mainstream methods, effectively handling diverse dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: The innovative orientation-driven approach of OriGS proves effective in enhancing 4D reconstruction quality for real-world dynamic environments.

Abstract: We present Orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting (OriGS), a novel framework
for high-quality 4D reconstruction from casually captured monocular videos.
While recent advances extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes via
various motion anchors, such as graph nodes or spline control points, they
often rely on low-rank assumptions and fall short in modeling complex,
region-specific deformations inherent to unconstrained dynamics. OriGS
addresses this by introducing a hyperdimensional representation grounded in
scene orientation. We first estimate a Global Orientation Field that propagates
principal forward directions across space and time, serving as stable
structural guidance for dynamic modeling. Built upon this, we propose
Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian, a unified formulation that embeds time,
space, geometry, and orientation into a coherent probabilistic state. This
enables inferring region-specific deformation through principled conditioned
slicing, adaptively capturing diverse local dynamics in alignment with global
motion intent. Experiments demonstrate the superior reconstruction fidelity of
OriGS over mainstream methods in challenging real-world dynamic scenes.

*Divyam Madaan,Varshan Muhunthan,Kyunghyun Cho,Sumit Chopra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores intra- and inter-modality dependencies in multi-modal learning through a study on 23 visual question-answering benchmarks, highlighting varying dependency patterns and weaknesses in benchmark design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limited understanding of intra- and inter-modality dependency interactions in current multi-modal learning benchmarks.

Method: A large-scale empirical study is conducted using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) across various domains, analyzing visual question-answering datasets to quantify modality dependencies.

Result: The paper reveals significant variation in reliance on vision and text across benchmarks, identifies unintended biases (e.g., increased image-only dependencies), and highlights the limitations of larger models in true multi-modal reasoning.

Conclusion: The research offers quantitative insights to better design and evaluate multi-modal benchmarks, advocating for awareness of biases and dependencies within datasets.

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (the
contribution of an individual modality to a target task) and inter-modality
dependencies (the relationships between modalities and the target task) is
fundamental to advancing multi-modal learning. However, the nature of and
interaction between these dependencies within current benchmark evaluations
remains poorly characterized. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical
study to quantify these dependencies across 23 visual question-answering
benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) covering domains
such as general and expert knowledge reasoning, optical character recognition,
and document understanding. Our findings show that the reliance on vision,
question (text), and their interaction varies significantly, both across and
within benchmarks. We discover that numerous benchmarks intended to mitigate
text-only biases have inadvertently amplified image-only dependencies. This
characterization persists across model sizes, as larger models often use these
intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that mask an underlying
lack of multi-modal reasoning. We provide a quantitative characterization of
multi-modal datasets, enabling a principled approach to multi-modal benchmark
design and evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework integrates Dynamic Kernel and Encoder Attention mechanisms to improve polyp segmentation accuracy and efficiency, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polyp segmentation is crucial for colorectal cancer detection but remains challenging due to diverse shapes, sizes, and low contrast boundaries in medical imaging.

Method: The framework utilizes Dynamic Kernel mechanism, global Encoder Attention module, and Unified Channel Adaptation in the decoder to refine segmentation predictions and enhance feature aggregation.

Result: The approach achieves superior Dice and Intersection over Union scores compared to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets like KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a robust, adaptable, and computationally efficient solution for polyp segmentation, suitable for clinical and automated diagnostic applications.

Abstract: Polyp segmentation is a critical step in colorectal cancer detection, yet it
remains challenging due to the diverse shapes, sizes, and low contrast
boundaries of polyps in medical imaging. In this work, we propose a novel
framework that improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency by integrating a
Dynamic Kernel (DK) mechanism with a global Encoder Attention module. The DK
mechanism, initialized by a global context vector from the EA module,
iteratively refines segmentation predictions across decoding stages, enabling
the model to focus on and accurately delineate complex polyp boundaries. The EA
module enhances the network's ability to capture critical lesion features by
aggregating multi scale information from all encoder layers. In addition, we
employ Unified Channel Adaptation (UCA) in the decoder to standardize feature
dimensions across stages, ensuring consistent and computationally efficient
information fusion. Our approach extends the lesion-aware kernel framework by
introducing a more flexible, attention driven kernel initialization and a
unified decoder design. Extensive experiments on the KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state of the
art segmentation methods, achieving superior Dice and Intersection over Union
scores. Moreover, UCA simplifies the decoder structure, reducing computational
cost without compromising accuracy. Overall, the proposed method provides a
robust and adaptable solution for polyp segmentation, with promising
applications in clinical and automated diagnostic systems.

*Akila Kadambi,Marco Iacoboni,Lisa Aziz-Zadeh,Srini Narayanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ActPLD, a benchmark to evaluate action recognition in multi-modal language models (MLLMs) using sparse point-light displays (PLDs) of human movement, showing that state-of-the-art models perform poorly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point-light displays (PLDs) highlight humans' ability to derive semantic information from minimal visual inputs, particularly body motion. The paper aims to test whether MLLMs can process and understand actions isolated from spatiotemporal body motion cues.

Method: The authors developed ActPLD, a new benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capabilities in action recognition using single-actor and socially interacting PLD datasets, and evaluated both proprietary and open-source models.

Result: The study found that current state-of-the-art MLLMs consistently displayed low performance when tasked with action understanding from PLDs, exposing limitations in spatiotemporal reasoning.

Conclusion: The paper underscores gaps in MLLMs' ability to understand actions and spatiotemporal cues, suggesting urgent needs for methodological advancements in these models.

Abstract: Humans can extract rich semantic information from minimal visual cues, as
demonstrated by point-light displays (PLDs), which consist of sparse sets of
dots localized to key joints of the human body. This ability emerges early in
development and is largely attributed to human embodied experience. Since PLDs
isolate body motion as the sole source of meaning, they represent key stimuli
for testing the constraints of action understanding in these systems. Here we
introduce ActPLD, the first benchmark to evaluate action processing in MLLMs
from human PLDs. Tested models include state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source systems on single-actor and socially interacting PLDs. Our results
reveal consistently low performance across models, introducing fundamental gaps
in action and spatiotemporal understanding.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a large-scale framework using radiomics and deep learning to predict mortality in systemic sclerosis patients with interstitial lung disease analyzed through chest CT scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interstitial lung disease contributes significantly to the mortality caused by systemic sclerosis, and predicting mortality efficiently remains underexplored. Chest CT plays a central diagnostic role but lacks established frameworks for assessing long-term outcomes.

Method: Chest CT scans of systemic sclerosis patients were analyzed using advanced radiomics and deep learning methods, experimenting with ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, and Swin Transformer models fine-tuned on 2,125 CT images from three mortality intervals (one, three, and five years).

Result: The best-performing models yielded AUCs of 0.769, 0.801, and 0.709 in predicting mortality at one, three, and five-year intervals respectively, demonstrating effective frameworks for mortality risk assessment.

Conclusion: The integration of radiomics and deep learning offers promising improvements in early detection and risk prediction for systemic sclerosis-related interstitial lung disease, marking important progress in identifying high-risk patients.

Abstract: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Chest computed tomography (CT) is the primary
imaging modality for diagnosing and monitoring lung complications in SSc
patients. However, its role in disease progression and mortality prediction has
not yet been fully clarified. This study introduces a novel, large-scale
longitudinal chest CT analysis framework that utilizes radiomics and deep
learning to predict mortality associated with lung complications of SSc. We
collected and analyzed 2,125 CT scans from SSc patients enrolled in the
Northwestern Scleroderma Registry, conducting mortality analyses at one, three,
and five years using advanced imaging analysis techniques. Death labels were
assigned based on recorded deaths over the one-, three-, and five-year
intervals, confirmed by expert physicians. In our dataset, 181, 326, and 428 of
the 2,125 CT scans were from patients who died within one, three, and five
years, respectively. Using ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, and Swin Transformer we use
pre-trained models, and fine-tuned on 2,125 images of SSc patients. Models
achieved an AUC of 0.769, 0.801, 0.709 for predicting mortality within one-,
three-, and five-years, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential of
both radiomics and deep learning computational methods to improve early
detection and risk assessment of SSc-related interstitial lung disease, marking
a significant advancement in the literature.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Weiheng Chai,Jiyang Wang,Sanjeda Akter,Senem Velipasalar Gursoy,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a resource-efficient adaptive super-resolution framework for driver monitoring systems, achieving better calibration and precision-recall compared to standard low-resolution models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the safety risks of poorly calibrated predictions in driver monitoring systems while maintaining high accuracy in detecting critical events like drowsiness and phone use.

Method: The paper introduces an adaptive super-resolution framework designed for calibration and high precision-recall. Additionally, a lightweight artifact detector ensures safety by minimizing hallucinations caused by super-resolution.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results with improved metrics: 5.8% ECE, 0.78 AUPR for drowsiness detection, and 0.74 precision-recall for phone use detection. The artifact detector is efficient with 0.3M parameters and 5.2ms overhead.

Conclusion: The adaptive super-resolution framework is a superior method for ensuring reliability in safety-critical driver monitoring applications, outperforming low-resolution-trained baselines on key safety metrics.

Abstract: Driver monitoring systems require not just high accuracy but reliable,
well-calibrated confidence scores for safety-critical deployment. While direct
low-resolution training yields high overall accuracy, it produces poorly
calibrated predictions that can be dangerous in safety-critical scenarios. We
propose a resource-aware adaptive super-resolution framework that optimizes for
model calibration and high precision-recall on critical events. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on safety-centric metrics: best
calibration (ECE of 5.8\% vs 6.2\% for LR-trained baselines), highest AUPR for
drowsiness detection (0.78 vs 0.74), and superior precision-recall for phone
use detection (0.74 vs 0.71). A lightweight artifact detector (0.3M parameters,
5.2ms overhead) provides additional safety by filtering SR-induced
hallucinations. While LR-trained video models serve as strong general-purpose
baselines, our adaptive framework represents the state-of-the-art solution for
safety-critical applications where reliability is paramount.

*Hongyang Li,Jinyuan Qu,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces OVSeg3R, a training framework that uses 2D perception models and 3D reconstruction for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation, improving results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D open-vocabulary instance segmentation models are limited in performance and convenience. This paper aims to leverage the strong capabilities of 2D perception models combined with 3D reconstruction to improve segmentation accuracy and practicality.

Method: OVSeg3R uses 2D instance masks projected into 3D through reconstruction models to generate annotations. It introduces a View-wise Instance Partition algorithm to prevent false positives and a 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint method to enhance clustering precision.

Result: OVSeg3R extends a closed-vocabulary 3D segmentation model to open-vocabulary and achieves a +2.3 mAP improvement overall on the ScanNet200 benchmark, with a significant +7.1 mAP boost on novel classes.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the effectiveness of OVSeg3R in enhancing 3D segmentation performance, particularly for novel classes, through innovative training strategies and architecture improvements.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training scheme called OVSeg3R to learn
open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation from well-studied 2D perception models
with the aid of 3D reconstruction. OVSeg3R directly adopts reconstructed scenes
from 2D videos as input, avoiding costly manual adjustment while aligning input
with real-world applications. By exploiting the 2D to 3D correspondences
provided by 3D reconstruction models, OVSeg3R projects each view's 2D instance
mask predictions, obtained from an open-vocabulary 2D model, onto 3D to
generate annotations for the view's corresponding sub-scene. To avoid
incorrectly introduced false positives as supervision due to partial
annotations from 2D to 3D, we propose a View-wise Instance Partition algorithm,
which partitions predictions to their respective views for supervision,
stabilizing the training process. Furthermore, since 3D reconstruction models
tend to over-smooth geometric details, clustering reconstructed points into
representative super-points based solely on geometry, as commonly done in
mainstream 3D segmentation methods, may overlook geometrically non-salient
objects. We therefore introduce 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint, which
leverages 2D masks to constrain the superpoint clustering, preventing
superpoints from violating instance boundaries. With these designs, OVSeg3R not
only extends a state-of-the-art closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation
model to open-vocabulary, but also substantially narrows the performance gap
between tail and head classes, ultimately leading to an overall improvement of
+2.3 mAP on the ScanNet200 benchmark. Furthermore, under the standard
open-vocabulary setting, OVSeg3R surpasses previous methods by about +7.1 mAP
on the novel classes, further validating its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the adoption and potential of 3DGS as an efficient alternative to NeRF, enhancing photorealism, geometric fidelity, and performance for various downstream tasks.

Method: The study systematically compares pipelines in different domains using unified research questions to highlight the advantages, adaptations, and limitations of 3DGS.

Result: 3DGS demonstrates technical advantages including efficient optimization, higher photorealism, and better integration into domain-specific constraints compared to NeRF.

Conclusion: 3DGS is emerging as a superior method for neural rendering due to its balance of photorealism, geometry accuracy, and computational efficiency, marking its potential across tasks like SLAM, telepresence, and content creation.

Abstract: Neural scene representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have transformed how 3D environments are modeled,
rendered, and interpreted. NeRF introduced view-consistent photorealism via
volumetric rendering; 3DGS has rapidly emerged as an explicit, efficient
alternative that supports high-quality rendering, faster optimization, and
integration into hybrid pipelines for enhanced photorealism and task-driven
scene understanding. This survey examines how 3DGS is being adopted across
SLAM, telepresence and teleoperation, robotic manipulation, and 3D content
generation. Despite their differences, these domains share common goals:
photorealistic rendering, meaningful 3D structure, and accurate downstream
tasks. We organize the review around unified research questions that explain
why 3DGS is increasingly displacing NeRF-based approaches: What technical
advantages drive its adoption? How does it adapt to different input modalities
and domain-specific constraints? What limitations remain? By systematically
comparing domain-specific pipelines, we show that 3DGS balances photorealism,
geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency. The survey offers a roadmap
for leveraging neural rendering not only for image synthesis but also for
perception, interaction, and content creation across real and virtual
environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first federated learning approach for segmenting pancreas regions (head, body, tail) in MRI, overcoming data scarcity and technical complexities while maintaining privacy across institutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pancreatic diseases often exhibit regional heterogeneity, affecting accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Existing methods struggle due to limited data and technical complexity of pancreas segmentation in MRI.

Method: The paper leverages a privacy-preserving FL framework to train models across seven institutions without data sharing. Three segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net, Swin UNETR) paired with two FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx) were systemically evaluated. A novel anatomically-informed loss function was also proposed.

Result: The Attention U-Net paired with FedAvg was found optimal for addressing pancreatic heterogeneity. The model achieves clinically viable performance, even with distributed and heterogeneous datasets.

Conclusion: The FL framework effectively advances pancreas segmentation in MRI, ensuring data privacy while enabling better diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic diseases.

Abstract: We present the first federated learning (FL) approach for pancreas part(head,
body and tail) segmentation in MRI, addressing a critical clinical challenge as
a significant innovation. Pancreatic diseases exhibit marked regional
heterogeneity cancers predominantly occur in the head region while chronic
pancreatitis causes tissue loss in the tail, making accurate segmentation of
the organ into head, body, and tail regions essential for precise diagnosis and
treatment planning. This segmentation task remains exceptionally challenging in
MRI due to variable morphology, poor soft-tissue contrast, and anatomical
variations across patients. Our novel contribution tackles two fundamental
challenges: first, the technical complexity of pancreas part delineation in
MRI, and second the data scarcity problem that has hindered prior approaches.
We introduce a privacy-preserving FL framework that enables collaborative model
training across seven medical institutions without direct data sharing,
leveraging a diverse dataset of 711 T1W and 726 T2W MRI scans. Our key
innovations include: (1) a systematic evaluation of three state-of-the-art
segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net,Swin UNETR) paired with two
FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx), revealing Attention U-Net with FedAvg as
optimal for pancreatic heterogeneity, which was never been done before; (2) a
novel anatomically-informed loss function prioritizing region-specific texture
contrasts in MRI. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach
achieves clinically viable performance despite training on distributed,
heterogeneous datasets.

TL;DR: NeuroAdapter directly conditions latent diffusion models on brain signals, skipping intermediate feature spaces, to decode visual stimuli with competitive accuracy while offering insights into cortical contributions during image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of transparency in current methods, which use intermediate mappings of brain signals into text/image features, limiting insights into specific cortical contributions.

Method: Proposes NeuroAdapter, integrating brain signals directly with latent diffusion models, and introduces IBBI framework for analyzing cortical influences via cross-attention mechanisms.

Result: Competitive visual reconstruction quality compared to previous methods, with improved transparency into cortical contributions across generative steps.

Conclusion: End-to-end brain-to-image decoding holds promise for advancing visual neuroscience and understanding diffusion models.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that complex visual stimuli can be decoded from
human brain activity using deep generative models, helping brain science
researchers interpret how the brain represents real-world scenes. However, most
current approaches leverage mapping brain signals into intermediate image or
text feature spaces before guiding the generative process, masking the effect
of contributions from different brain areas on the final reconstruction output.
In this work, we propose NeuroAdapter, a visual decoding framework that
directly conditions a latent diffusion model on brain representations,
bypassing the need for intermediate feature spaces. Our method demonstrates
competitive visual reconstruction quality on public fMRI datasets compared to
prior work, while providing greater transparency into how brain signals shape
the generation process. To this end, we contribute an Image-Brain
BI-directional interpretability framework (IBBI) which investigates
cross-attention mechanisms across diffusion denoising steps to reveal how
different cortical areas influence the unfolding generative trajectory. Our
results highlight the potential of end-to-end brain-to-image decoding and
establish a path toward interpreting diffusion models through the lens of
visual neuroscience.

*Kaicheng Yang,Xun Zhang,Haotong Qin,Yucheng Lin,Kaisen Yang,Xianglong Yan,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces RobuQ, a systematic Quantization-Aware Training framework designed for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to reduce computational and memory costs, achieving state-of-the-art performance in extremely low-bit quantization settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers outperform U-Nets in image generation, but their practical use is limited by high computational and memory requirements. Existing quantization methods face challenges with DiTs due to their activation sensitivity and distribution complexity.

Method: The authors propose RobuQ, starting with a ternary weight DiT baseline and introducing robust activation quantization via a Hadamard transform. Furthermore, they develop AMPN, an Activation-only Mixed-Precision Network pipeline, which applies ternary weights and assigns different activation precisions across layers to eliminate bottlenecks.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate RobuQ's state-of-the-art performance in sub-4-bit quantization, including stable and competitive image generation on ImageNet-1K with activations quantized to an average of 2 bits.

Conclusion: RobuQ successfully addresses activation quantization challenges in DiTs, enabling practical deployment with reduced resource requirements without compromising performance. This is a significant step for low-bit quantization in image generation models.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for image generation, demonstrating superior scalability and performance over
U-Net architectures. However, their practical deployment is hindered by
substantial computational and memory costs. While Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT) has shown promise for U-Nets, its application to DiTs faces unique
challenges, primarily due to the sensitivity and distributional complexity of
activations. In this work, we identify activation quantization as the primary
bottleneck for pushing DiTs to extremely low-bit settings. To address this, we
propose a systematic QAT framework for DiTs, named RobuQ. We start by
establishing a strong ternary weight (W1.58A4) DiT baseline. Building upon
this, we propose RobustQuantizer to achieve robust activation quantization. Our
theoretical analyses show that the Hadamard transform can convert unknown
per-token distributions into per-token normal distributions, providing a strong
foundation for this method. Furthermore, we propose AMPN, the first
Activation-only Mixed-Precision Network pipeline for DiTs. This method applies
ternary weights across the entire network while allocating different activation
precisions to each layer to eliminate information bottlenecks. Through
extensive experiments on unconditional and conditional image generation, our
RobuQ framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for DiT quantization in
sub-4-bit quantization configuration. To the best of our knowledge, RobuQ is
the first achieving stable and competitive image generation on large datasets
like ImageNet-1K with activations quantized to average 2 bits. The code and
models will be available at https://github.com/racoonykc/RobuQ .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current video face enhancement methods, including issues with modeling facial textures, model generalization due to limited data, and inefficiency in the inference process.

Method: VividFace combines a one-step flow matching paradigm based on WANX's video generation model, with a Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training strategy and an MLLM-driven pipeline for curating high-quality datasets.

Result: VividFace delivers state-of-the-art performance in perceptual quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability while significantly cutting down inference time.

Conclusion: The proposed framework, VividFace, advances video face enhancement by overcoming key challenges, improving quality and efficiency, and contributing resources to the research community.

Abstract: Video Face Enhancement (VFE) seeks to reconstruct high-quality facial regions
from degraded video sequences, a capability that underpins numerous
applications including video conferencing, film restoration, and surveillance.
Despite substantial progress in the field, current methods that primarily rely
on video super-resolution and generative frameworks continue to face three
fundamental challenges: (1) faithfully modeling intricate facial textures while
preserving temporal consistency; (2) restricted model generalization due to the
lack of high-quality face video training data; and (3) low efficiency caused by
repeated denoising steps during inference. To address these challenges, we
propose VividFace, a novel and efficient one-step diffusion framework for video
face enhancement. Built upon the pretrained WANX video generation model, our
method leverages powerful spatiotemporal priors through a single-step flow
matching paradigm, enabling direct mapping from degraded inputs to high-quality
outputs with significantly reduced inference time. To further boost efficiency,
we propose a Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training strategy that employs
stochastic switching between facial region optimization and global
reconstruction, providing explicit supervision in both latent and pixel spaces
through a progressive two-stage training process. Additionally, we introduce an
MLLM-driven data curation pipeline for automated selection of high-quality
video face datasets, enhancing model generalization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VividFace achieves state-of-the-art results in perceptual
quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while offering
practical resources for the research community.

*Chenxi Zhao,Daochang Wang,Siqian Zhang,Gangyao Kuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper innovates SAR target recognition by using forward scattering center models (FSCM) for better knowledge migration, addressing limited sample issues in simulated data approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SAR recognition methods face challenges with simulated data due to irrelevant background and noise, undermining the quality of transferred information.

Method: The authors propose a multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer (MHKT) network, utilizing FSCM and employing techniques like task-associated information selector (TAIS) and novel metrics like maximum discrimination divergence (MDD) for effective feature, distribution, and category knowledge migration.

Result: Experiments on two datasets combining FSCM and measured SAR images show enhanced recognition performance, validating the proposed method.

Conclusion: The study presents a refined knowledge migration approach using FSCM and MHKT, achieving purer target feature transfer and improved SAR recognition outcomes.

Abstract: Simulated data-assisted SAR target recognition methods are the research
hotspot currently, devoted to solving the problem of limited samples. Existing
works revolve around simulated images, but the large amount of irrelevant
information embedded in the images, such as background, noise, etc., seriously
affects the quality of the migrated information. Our work explores a new
simulated data to migrate purer and key target knowledge, i.e., forward
scattering center model (FSCM) which models the actual local structure of the
target with strong physical meaning and interpretability. To achieve this
purpose, multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer (MHKT) network is
proposed, which fully migrates FSCM knowledge from the feature, distribution
and category levels, respectively. Specifically, we permit the more suitable
feature representations for the heterogeneous data and separate non-informative
knowledge by task-associated information selector (TAIS), to complete purer
target feature migration. In the distribution alignment, the new metric
function maximum discrimination divergence (MDD) in target generic knowledge
transfer (TGKT) module perceives transferable knowledge efficiently while
preserving discriminative structure about classes. Moreover, category relation
knowledge transfer (CRKT) module leverages the category relation consistency
constraint to break the dilemma of optimization bias towards simulation data
due to imbalance between simulated and measured data. Such stepwise knowledge
selection and migration will ensure the integrity of the migrated FSCM
knowledge. Notably, extensive experiments on two new datasets formed by FSCM
data and measured SAR images demonstrate the superior performance of our
method.

*Yixiao Chen,Ruining Yang,Xin Chen,Jia He,Dongliang Xu,Yue Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper surveys key advancements in topology-aware perception for autonomous driving, emphasizing the shift from static pre-built maps to dynamic, sensor-driven perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static maps for autonomous driving are costly, lack real-time adaptability, and pose scalability issues, necessitating dynamic and sensor-driven approaches.

Method: The paper reviews four research areas: vectorized map construction, topological structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based perception, highlighting their contributions to dynamic perception.

Result: The surveyed techniques focus on real-time map construction, semantic reasoning, robust integration of domain knowledge, and multimodal scene understanding for better scalability and adaptability.

Conclusion: Dynamic, sensor-driven perception systems are vital for developing adaptive, scalable, and explainable autonomous driving solutions.

Abstract: The key to achieving autonomous driving lies in topology-aware perception,
the structured understanding of the driving environment with an emphasis on
lane topology and road semantics. This survey systematically reviews four core
research directions under this theme: vectorized map construction, topological
structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based
perception. Across these directions, we observe a unifying trend: a paradigm
shift from static, pre-built maps to dynamic, sensor-driven perception.
Specifically, traditional static maps have provided semantic context for
autonomous systems. However, they are costly to construct, difficult to update
in real time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting their
scalability. In contrast, dynamic representations leverage on-board sensor data
for real-time map construction and topology reasoning. Each of the four
research directions contributes to this shift through compact spatial modeling,
semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and
multimodal scene understanding powered by pre-trained language models.
Together, they pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and explainable
autonomous driving systems.

*Han Hu,Zhuoran Zheng,Liang Li,Chen Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VAMamba, an adaptive image restoration framework that addresses limitations in fixed scanning patterns and feature inefficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the constraints of fixed path scanning and inefficient feature utilization in existing Mamba-based image restoration methods.

Method: VAMamba integrates QCLAM, which uses a FIFO cache for adaptive memory, and GPS-SS2D for adaptive scanning paths powered by Vision Transformers and greedy optimization.

Result: VAMamba demonstrates superior restoration quality and efficiency compared to prior methods across diverse tasks, setting new benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach highlights dynamic feature utilization and pixel importance for improved image restoration while achieving computational efficiency.

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based image restoration methods have achieved promising results
but remain
  limited by fixed scanning patterns and inefficient feature utilization.
Conventional Mamba
  architectures rely on predetermined paths that cannot adapt to diverse
degradations, constraining
  both restoration performance and computational efficiency. To overcome these
limitations, we
  propose VAMamba, a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework with two key innovations.
First,
  QCLAM(Queue-basedCacheLow-rankAdaptiveMemory)enhancesfeaturelearningthrougha
  FIFO cache that stores historical representations. Similarity between current
LoRA-adapted and
  cached features guides intelligent fusion, enabling dynamic reuse while
effectively controlling
  memorygrowth.Second, GPS-SS2D(GreedyPathScanSS2D)introducesadaptive scanning.
A
  Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a
greedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These
learned trajectories replace rigid
  patterns, enabling SS2D to perform targeted feature extraction. The
integration of QCLAM and
  GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while
maintaining high
  computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration
tasks demonstrate
  that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration
quality and
  efficiency, establishing new benchmarks for adaptive image restoration. Our

*Xingjian Yang,Ashis G. Banerjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for 6D pose estimation and tracking of novel objects, focusing on robust performance under challenging lighting conditions and efficient edge-device implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of accurately estimating and tracking 6D poses of novel objects under varying illumination and in real time remains a major hurdle, especially for efficient performance on edge devices.

Method: The framework combines a robust initial pose estimation module with a fast motion-based tracker, both using a shared, lighting-invariant color-pair feature representation. This ensures robust alignment and lightweight tracking.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show the framework achieves competitive accuracy in pose estimation and maintains reliable tracking through abrupt pose changes.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively balances robust accuracy and real-time efficiency, demonstrating its practicality for scenarios requiring 6D pose estimation and tracking on edge devices under varying conditions.

Abstract: Robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects under challenging illumination
remains a significant challenge, often requiring a trade-off between accurate
initial pose estimation and efficient real-time tracking. We present a unified
framework explicitly designed for efficient execution on edge devices, which
synergizes a robust initial estimation module with a fast motion-based tracker.
The key to our approach is a shared, lighting-invariant color-pair feature
representation that forms a consistent foundation for both stages. For initial
estimation, this feature facilitates robust registration between the live RGB-D
view and the object's 3D mesh. For tracking, the same feature logic validates
temporal correspondences, enabling a lightweight model to reliably regress the
object's motion. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our integrated approach is both effective and robust, providing competitive
pose estimation accuracy while maintaining high-fidelity tracking even through
abrupt pose changes.

*Zekun Wang,Ethan Haarer,Zhiyi Dai,Tianyi Zhu,Christopher J. MacLellan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents deep taxonomic networks, a new deep latent variable model for hierarchical clustering to address current limitations, such as tying to class counts and underuse of intermediate prototype information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in existing deep hierarchical clustering methods, like rigid ties to the number of classes and underutilization of prototype information at intermediate levels.

Method: The paper introduces a latent taxonomic hierarchy based on a binary tree-structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior within a variational inference framework, which allows automatic discovery of taxonomic structures.

Result: The proposed method achieves strong hierarchical clustering performance and outperforms existing baselines on diverse image datasets. It also discovers hierarchical taxonomies that are interpretable and align with both coarse and fine-grained categories.

Conclusion: Deep taxonomic networks offer a compelling advancement for unsupervised hierarchical clustering, enabling the automatic discovery of rich and interpretable taxonomic structures from unlabeled data.

Abstract: Inspired by the human ability to learn and organize knowledge into
hierarchical taxonomies with prototypes, this paper addresses key limitations
in current deep hierarchical clustering methods. Existing methods often tie the
structure to the number of classes and underutilize the rich prototype
information available at intermediate hierarchical levels. We introduce deep
taxonomic networks, a novel deep latent variable approach designed to bridge
these gaps. Our method optimizes a large latent taxonomic hierarchy,
specifically a complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior within
a variational inference framework, to automatically discover taxonomic
structures and associated prototype clusters directly from unlabeled data
without assuming true label sizes. We analytically show that optimizing the
ELBO of our method encourages the discovery of hierarchical relationships among
prototypes. Empirically, our learned models demonstrate strong hierarchical
clustering performance, outperforming baselines across diverse image
classification datasets using our novel evaluation mechanism that leverages
prototype clusters discovered at all hierarchical levels. Qualitative results
further reveal that deep taxonomic networks discover rich and interpretable
hierarchical taxonomies, capturing both coarse-grained semantic categories and
fine-grained visual distinctions.

inter-frame windowed self-attention, achieving cross-view feature mixing with
reduced overhead. (2) We propose a novel ERP fusion approach that projects
multi-view depth estimates to a shared equirectangular coordinate system to
obtain the final fusion depth. (3) We generate ERP image-depth pairs using HM3D

*Tangtangfang Fang,Jingxi Hu,Xiangjian He,Jiaqi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Latent Diffusion Enhanced Multistage Anti-Noise Network (MAN) that drastically reduces computational costs while maintaining high-quality LDCT image denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models produce high-quality LDCT denoising but are computationally prohibitive, limiting clinical applicability.

Method: The proposed MAN leverages a perceptually-optimized autoencoder to operate in a compressed latent space and utilizes an attention-based conditional U-Net for efficient denoising.

Result: On the LDCT and Projection dataset, MAN achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art diffusion models in terms of perceptual quality and PSNR/SSIM scores, while being over 60x faster in inference.

Conclusion: MAN enables the practical use of advanced generative models for medical imaging by effectively balancing high-fidelity results with computational efficiency.

Abstract: While diffusion models have set a new benchmark for quality in Low-Dose
Computed Tomography (LDCT) denoising, their clinical adoption is critically
hindered by extreme computational costs, with inference times often exceeding
thousands of seconds per scan. To overcome this barrier, we introduce MAN, a
Latent Diffusion Enhanced Multistage Anti-Noise Network for Efficient and
High-Quality Low-Dose CT Image Denoising task. Our method operates in a
compressed latent space via a perceptually-optimized autoencoder, enabling an
attention-based conditional U-Net to perform the fast, deterministic
conditional denoising diffusion process with drastically reduced overhead. On
the LDCT and Projection dataset, our model achieves superior perceptual
quality, surpassing CNN/GAN-based methods while rivaling the reconstruction
fidelity of computationally heavy diffusion models like DDPM and Dn-Dp. Most
critically, in the inference stage, our model is over 60x faster than
representative pixel space diffusion denoisers, while remaining competitive on
PSNR/SSIM scores. By bridging the gap between high fidelity and clinical
viability, our work demonstrates a practical path forward for advanced
generative models in medical imaging.

*Guole Shen,Tianchen Deng,Yanbo Wang,Yongtao Chen,Yilin Shen,Jiuming Liu,Jingchuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents GRS-SLAM3R, a novel end-to-end SLAM framework for dense scene reconstruction and pose estimation using sequential RGB image input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DUSt3R-based methods struggle with spatial memory and global consistency as they rely on per-pair image pointmaps.

Method: GRS-SLAM3R introduces spatial memory with a transformer-based gated update module, and partitions scenes into submaps for local alignment and global registration.

Result: The framework achieves higher reconstruction accuracy and maintains real-time performance across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: GRS-SLAM3R improves spatial correlation and produces globally consistent maps, addressing key shortcomings of earlier SLAM approaches.

Abstract: DUSt3R-based end-to-end scene reconstruction has recently shown promising
results in dense visual SLAM. However, most existing methods only use image
pairs to estimate pointmaps, overlooking spatial memory and global
consistency.To this end, we introduce GRS-SLAM3R, an end-to-end SLAM framework
for dense scene reconstruction and pose estimation from RGB images without any
prior knowledge of the scene or camera parameters. Unlike existing DUSt3R-based
frameworks, which operate on all image pairs and predict per-pair point maps in
local coordinate frames, our method supports sequentialized input and
incrementally estimates metric-scale point clouds in the global coordinate. In
order to improve consistent spatial correlation, we use a latent state for
spatial memory and design a transformer-based gated update module to reset and
update the spatial memory that continuously aggregates and tracks relevant 3D
information across frames. Furthermore, we partition the scene into submaps,
apply local alignment within each submap, and register all submaps into a
common world frame using relative constraints, producing a globally consistent
map. Experiments on various datasets show that our framework achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.

*Zeren Xiong,Yue Yu,Zedong Zhang,Shuo Chen,Jian Yang,Jun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces Visual Mixing Diffusion (VMDiff), a new method for fusing visual cues from two input images into a single, coherent output, tackling challenges in existing methods like coexistence and semantic bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current image-to-image generation methods, particularly the issues of coexistent generation (lack of integration between objects) and bias generation (imbalance due to semantic dominance).

Method: The authors propose VMDiff, a diffusion-based framework featuring (1) a hybrid sampling process that combines guided denoising, inversion, and spherical interpolation for structure-aware fusion, and (2) an adaptive adjustment module that uses a similarity-based score to optimize parameters automatically.

Result: VMDiff outperforms strong baselines in experiments on a curated 780 concept pair benchmark, achieving superior visual quality, semantic consistency, and creativity as rated by humans.

Conclusion: VMDiff offers an effective solution for visual fusion in image generation, overcoming key challenges in coexistence and semantic bias while demonstrating practical improvements in creativity and conceptual integration.

Abstract: Creating novel images by fusing visual cues from multiple sources is a
fundamental yet underexplored problem in image-to-image generation, with broad
applications in artistic creation, virtual reality and visual media. Existing
methods often face two key challenges: coexistent generation, where multiple
objects are simply juxtaposed without true integration, and bias generation,
where one object dominates the output due to semantic imbalance. To address
these issues, we propose Visual Mixing Diffusion (VMDiff), a simple yet
effective diffusion-based framework that synthesizes a single, coherent object
by integrating two input images at both noise and latent levels. Our approach
comprises: (1) a hybrid sampling process that combines guided denoising,
inversion, and spherical interpolation with adjustable parameters to achieve
structure-aware fusion, mitigating coexistent generation; and (2) an efficient
adaptive adjustment module, which introduces a novel similarity-based score to
automatically and adaptively search for optimal parameters, countering semantic
bias. Experiments on a curated benchmark of 780 concept pairs demonstrate that
our method outperforms strong baselines in visual quality, semantic
consistency, and human-rated creativity.

*Liubing Hu,Chen Wu,Anrui Wang,Dianjie Lu,Guijuan Zhang,Zhuoran Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowLUT integrates efficient Lookup Tables (LUTs) with adaptive priors and flow-matching methods for image enhancement, achieving computational efficiency and high representational capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge was to counter the trade-off between computational efficiency and representational capacity in deep learning-based image enhancement.

Method: FlowLUT uses differentiable 3D LUTs with multiple priors, scene-adaptive fusion via a lightweight prediction network, and an iterative flow matching method to enhance images efficiently.

Result: The method showed its effectiveness through extensive experimental assessments across three benchmarks.

Conclusion: FlowLUT offers a practical and efficient solution for real-time image enhancement by innovatively combining LUT efficiency and high representational adaptability.

Abstract: Deep learning-based image enhancement methods face a fundamental trade-off
between computational efficiency and representational capacity. For example,
although a conventional three-dimensional Look-Up Table (3D LUT) can process a
degraded image in real time, it lacks representational flexibility and depends
solely on a fixed prior. To address this problem, we introduce FlowLUT, a novel
end-to-end model that integrates the efficiency of LUTs, multiple priors, and
the parameter-independent characteristic of flow-matched reconstructed images.
Specifically, firstly, the input image is transformed in color space by a
collection of differentiable 3D LUTs (containing a large number of 3D LUTs with
different priors). Subsequently, a lightweight content-aware dynamically
predicts fusion weights, enabling scene-adaptive color correction with
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity. Next, a lightweight fusion prediction network runs
on multiple 3D LUTs, with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity for scene-adaptive color
correction.Furthermore, to address the inherent representation limitations of
LUTs, we design an innovative iterative flow matching method to restore local
structural details and eliminate artifacts. Finally, the entire model is
jointly optimized under a composite loss function enforcing perceptual and
structural fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on three benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a closed-loop evaluation framework that integrates real-world traffic scenarios into the CARLA simulator using infrastructure cooperation, aiming for more realistic autonomous driving performance evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CARLA simulations rely on manually crafted traffic scenarios, which often diverge from real-world conditions, limiting their usefulness for evaluating autonomous driving systems.

Method: The authors create a simulator framework by integrating 800 dynamic traffic scenarios and static digital twin assets from real-world intersections, derived from a 100-hour dataset collected via high-mounted infrastructure sensors.

Result: The developed framework replicates realistic traffic and environmental conditions, providing a robust platform for challenging closed-loop evaluation in diverse urban traffic settings.

Conclusion: This approach enables more accurate and challenging benchmarks for autonomous driving models, bridging the gap between simulation and real-world driving scenarios.

Abstract: Closed-loop evaluation is increasingly critical for end-to-end autonomous
driving. Current closed-loop benchmarks using the CARLA simulator rely on
manually configured traffic scenarios, which can diverge from real-world
conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance. To
address these limitations, we introduce a simple yet challenging closed-loop
evaluation framework that closely integrates real-world driving scenarios into
the CARLA simulator with infrastructure cooperation. Our approach involves
extracting 800 dynamic traffic scenarios selected from a comprehensive 100-hour
video dataset captured by high-mounted infrastructure sensors, and creating
static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent
visual appearance. These digital twins accurately replicate the traffic and
environmental characteristics of their real-world counterparts, enabling more
realistic simulations in CARLA. This evaluation is challenging due to the
diversity of driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day
at complex urban intersections. In addition, we provide a comprehensive
closed-loop benchmark for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models.

*Xinhao Cai,Minghang Zheng,Xin Jin,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel dataset and pipeline for generating realistic, text-specified human-object interactions in 3D scenes with movable objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack sufficient interaction categories and focus only on static objects, which limits the ability to model real-life interactions with movable objects in 3D scenes.

Method: The authors created the InteractMove dataset with diverse movable objects and proposed a pipeline using 3D visual grounding, hand-object affordance learning, and optimization techniques to ensure accurate and physically plausible interactions.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing approaches in generating more realistic and text-compliant human-object interactions in 3D settings.

Conclusion: The contributions address a significant gap in human-object interaction modeling, enabling more complex, realistic, and controlled interactions in movable-object 3D scenarios.

Abstract: We propose a novel task of text-controlled human object interaction
generation in 3D scenes with movable objects. Existing human-scene interaction
datasets suffer from insufficient interaction categories and typically only
consider interactions with static objects (do not change object positions), and
the collection of such datasets with movable objects is difficult and costly.
To address this problem, we construct the InteractMove dataset for Movable
Human-Object Interaction in 3D Scenes by aligning existing human object
interaction data with scene contexts, featuring three key characteristics: 1)
scenes containing multiple movable objects with text-controlled interaction
specifications (including same-category distractors requiring spatial and 3D
scene context understanding), 2) diverse object types and sizes with varied
interaction patterns (one-hand, two-hand, etc.), and 3) physically plausible
object manipulation trajectories. With the introduction of various movable
objects, this task becomes more challenging, as the model needs to identify
objects to be interacted with accurately, learn to interact with objects of
different sizes and categories, and avoid collisions between movable objects
and the scene. To tackle such challenges, we propose a novel pipeline solution.
We first use 3D visual grounding models to identify the interaction object.
Then, we propose a hand-object joint affordance learning to predict contact
regions for different hand joints and object parts, enabling accurate grasping
and manipulation of diverse objects. Finally, we optimize interactions with
local-scene modeling and collision avoidance constraints, ensuring physically
plausible motions and avoiding collisions between objects and the scene.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in generating
physically plausible, text-compliant interactions compared to existing
approaches.

Motivation: Existing traffic simulators for autonomous driving face a distributional shift challenge between training and testing, which impacts generalization in unseen environments.

Method: The authors propose SMART-R1, which uses a novel R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning framework with a metric-oriented policy optimization algorithm and an iterative supervised and reinforcement fine-tuning training strategy.

Result: Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) validate the framework's effectiveness, with SMART-R1 achieving a realism meta score of 0.7858, ranking first on the Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge (WOSAC) leaderboard.

Conclusion: SMART-R1 provides a simple yet powerful method to align simulated traffic behavior with human preferences, overcoming distributional shifts and advancing the realism of multi-agent traffic simulations.

Abstract: Scalable and realistic simulation of multi-agent traffic behavior is critical
for advancing autonomous driving technologies. Although existing data-driven
simulators have made significant strides in this domain, they predominantly
rely on supervised learning to align simulated distributions with real-world
driving scenarios. A persistent challenge, however, lies in the distributional
shift that arises between training and testing, which often undermines model
generalization in unseen environments. To address this limitation, we propose
SMART-R1, a novel R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm tailored for
next-token prediction models to better align agent behavior with human
preferences and evaluation metrics. Our approach introduces a metric-oriented
policy optimization algorithm to improve distribution alignment and an
iterative "SFT-RFT-SFT" training strategy that alternates between Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to maximize performance
gains. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset
(WOMD) validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful R1-style training
framework in enhancing foundation models. The results on the Waymo Open Sim
Agents Challenge (WOSAC) showcase that SMART-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance with an overall realism meta score of 0.7858, ranking first on the

Conclusion: BioVessel-Net is a label-free and computationally efficient framework for retinal vessel analysis, with broad applications in glaucoma monitoring and progression prediction. The proposed RetinaMix dataset further facilitates research in this domain.

Abstract: Structural changes in retinal blood vessels are critical biomarkers for the
onset and progression of glaucoma and other ocular diseases. However, current
vessel segmentation approaches largely rely on supervised learning and
extensive manual annotations, which are costly, error-prone, and difficult to
obtain in optical coherence tomography angiography. Here we present
BioVessel-Net, an unsupervised generative framework that integrates vessel
biostatistics with adversarial refinement and a radius-guided segmentation
strategy. Unlike pixel-based methods, BioVessel-Net directly models vascular
structures with biostatistical coherence, achieving accurate and explainable
vessel extraction without labeled data or high-performance computing. To
support training and evaluation, we introduce RetinaMix, a new benchmark
dataset of 2D and 3D OCTA images with high-resolution vessel details from
diverse populations. Experimental results demonstrate that BioVessel-Net
achieves near-perfect segmentation accuracy across RetinaMix and existing
datasets, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art supervised and
semi-supervised methods. Together, BioVessel-Net and RetinaMix provide a
label-free, computationally efficient, and clinically interpretable solution
for retinal vessel analysis, with broad potential for glaucoma monitoring,
blood flow modeling, and progression prediction. Code and dataset are

### [465] [DiffInk: Glyph- and Style-Aware Latent Diffusion Transformer for Text to Online Handwriting Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23624)
*Wei Pan,Huiguo He,Hiuyi Cheng,Yilin Shi,Lianwen Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiffInk, a novel framework for generating online handwriting that improves on glyph accuracy, style fidelity, and efficiency by combining a latent diffusion Transformer with a variational autoencoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency and lack of holistic structural modeling in character- or word-level handwriting generation methods motivated the development of a full-line generation framework.

Method: The method combines a sequential variational autoencoder (InkVAE) with latent-space regularization and a latent diffusion Transformer (InkDiT) for generating pen trajectories conditioned on text and style.

Result: DiffInk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in glyph accuracy, style fidelity, and generation efficiency.

Conclusion: DiffInk effectively disentangles content and style, enabling scalable, high-quality handwriting generation.

Abstract: Deep generative models have advanced text-to-online handwriting generation
(TOHG), which aims to synthesize realistic pen trajectories conditioned on
textual input and style references. However, most existing methods still
primarily focus on character- or word-level generation, resulting in
inefficiency and a lack of holistic structural modeling when applied to full
text lines. To address these issues, we propose DiffInk, the first latent
diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation. We first
introduce InkVAE, a novel sequential variational autoencoder enhanced with two
complementary latent-space regularization losses: (1) an OCR-based loss
enforcing glyph-level accuracy, and (2) a style-classification loss preserving
writing style. This dual regularization yields a semantically structured latent
space where character content and writer styles are effectively disentangled.
We then introduce InkDiT, a novel latent diffusion Transformer that integrates
target text and reference styles to generate coherent pen trajectories.
Experimental results demonstrate that DiffInk outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity, while
significantly improving generation efficiency. Code will be made publicly
available.

### [466] [RIV: Recursive Introspection Mask Diffusion Vision Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23625)
*YuQian Li,Limeng Qiao,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel model called RIV that enhances Mask Diffusion Vision Language Models by adding self-correction capabilities with Introspection Training and Recursive Inference mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inability of Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models (MDVLMs) to self-correct errors in their generated outputs, particularly logical errors.

Method: Introduces two techniques: Introspection Training, where a separate Introspection Model detects errors in generated sequences, and Recursive Inference, a process of iterative correction combining unmasking, introspection, and remasking.

Result: RIV achieves state-of-the-art performance on various multimodal benchmarks, surpassing existing MDVLM models.

Conclusion: Equipping MDVLMs with self-correction capabilities significantly improves their logical and grammatical reliability, setting a higher standard in multimodal understanding tasks.

Abstract: Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models (MDVLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in multimodal understanding tasks. However, these models are unable to
correct errors in generated tokens, meaning they lack self-correction
capability. In this paper, we propose Recursive Introspection Mask Diffusion
Vision Language Model (RIV), which equips the model with self-correction
ability through two novel mechanisms. The first is Introspection Training,
where an Introspection Model is introduced to identify errors within generated
sequences. Introspection Training enables the model to detect not only
grammatical and spelling mistakes, but more importantly, logical errors. The
second is Recursive Inference. Beginning with the standard unmasking step, the
learned Introspection Model helps to identify errors in the output sequence and
remask them. This alternating
($\text{unmask}\rightarrow\text{introspection}\rightarrow\text{remask}$)
process is repeated recursively until reliable results are obtained.
Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed RIV
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

*Beomseok Kang,Niluthpol Chowdhury Mithun,Mikhail Sizintsev,Han-Pang Chiu,Supun Samarasekera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents FAMDA, a framework leveraging Vision Foundation Models for multi-task unsupervised domain adaptation, achieving state-of-the-art results in domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-task UDA approaches struggle in domain adaptation and lack the efficiency of self-training techniques. The aim is to address domain shift in robotics via a novel framework that better utilizes VFMs.

Method: FAMDA uses self-training by integrating segmentation and depth Vision Foundation Models to generate pseudo-labels, distilling their generalization into a lightweight student network.

Result: FAMDA achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks (synthetic-to-real & day-to-night adaptation) and enables efficient models, being smaller by 10x with comparable accuracy.

Conclusion: FAMDA is effective for domain adaptation and resource-constrained robotics, showcasing robust performance and efficiency compared to traditional methods in the multi-task UDA domain.

Abstract: Multi-task dense prediction, which aims to jointly solve tasks like semantic
segmentation and depth estimation, is crucial for robotics applications but
suffers from domain shift when deploying models in new environments. While
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge for single tasks,
existing multi-task UDA methods primarily rely on adversarial learning
approaches that are less effective than recent self-training techniques. In
this paper, we introduce FAMDA, a simple yet effective UDA framework that
bridges this gap by leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as powerful
teachers. Our approach integrates Segmentation and Depth foundation models into
a self-training paradigm to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for the target
domain, effectively distilling their robust generalization capabilities into a
single, efficient student network. Extensive experiments show that FAMDA
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard synthetic-to-real UDA
multi-task learning (MTL) benchmarks and a challenging new day-to-night
adaptation task. Our framework enables the training of highly efficient models;
a lightweight variant achieves SOTA accuracy while being more than 10$\times$
smaller than foundation models, highlighting FAMDA's suitability for creating
domain-adaptive and efficient models for resource-constrained robotics
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to unlock the potential of Large Language Models for effective use in motion data processing for various tasks.

Method: The framework utilizes residual quantization-based motion tokenization, a Delay Parallel Modeling strategy to streamline dependencies, and a dual-tower architecture to reduce interference between language and motion modalities.

Result: Comprehensive ablation studies and experiments validate the effectiveness of MotionVerse, showing its strong performance across motion-relevant tasks.

Conclusion: MotionVerse is a highly effective framework for integrating motion data with language models, with potential applications in numerous motion tasks.

Abstract: This paper proposes MotionVerse, a unified framework that harnesses the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend, generate, and edit
human motion in both single-person and multi-person scenarios. To efficiently
represent motion data, we employ a motion tokenizer with residual quantization,
which converts continuous motion sequences into multi-stream discrete tokens.
Furthermore, we introduce a \textit{Delay Parallel} Modeling strategy, which
temporally staggers the encoding of residual token streams. This design enables
LLMs to effectively capture inter-stream dependencies while maintaining
computational efficiency comparable to single-stream modeling. Moreover, to
alleviate modality interference between motion and language, we design a
\textit{dual-tower architecture} with modality-specific parameters, ensuring
stable integration of motion information for both comprehension and generation
tasks. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each
component in MotionVerse, and extensive experiments showcase its superior
performance across a wide range of motion-relevant tasks.

*Seungwook Kim,Seunghyeon Lee,Minsu Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces inference-time techniques to enhance diffusion-based robot video generation by actively integrating explicit action parameters through two methods: action-scaled classifier-free guidance and noise truncation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve realism and coherence in robot video generation based on explicit action trajectories, assisting effective world and robotics foundation models.

Method: Proposes two methods—action-scaled classifier-free guidance dynamically modifies guidance strength, and action-scaled noise truncation adjusts initial noise sampling, both leveraging explicit action parameters without requiring training.

Result: Experimental analysis on real robot manipulation data shows improved action coherence and visual quality across various scenarios.

Conclusion: The methods make diffusion-based video generation more effective for robotics by actively utilizing explicit action trajectories for enhanced visual and action realism.

Abstract: Generating realistic robot videos from explicit action trajectories is a
critical step toward building effective world models and robotics foundation
models. We introduce two training-free, inference-time techniques that fully
exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation.
Instead of treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals, our methods
actively incorporate them to guide both the classifier-free guidance process
and the initialization of Gaussian latents. First, action-scaled
classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates guidance strength in proportion
to action magnitude, enhancing controllability over motion intensity. Second,
action-scaled noise truncation adjusts the distribution of initially sampled
noise to better align with the desired motion dynamics. Experiments on real
robot manipulation datasets demonstrate that these techniques significantly
improve action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.

*Boyu Han,Qianqian Xu,Shilong Bao,Zhiyong Yang,Kangli Zi,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LightFair proposes a lighter, efficient method to enhance fairness in text-to-image diffusion models by fine-tuning text embeddings, avoiding heavy training burdens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness-related biases in text-to-image diffusion models without requiring substantial computational resource demands typically needed by existing methods.

Method: LightFair fine-tunes the text embeddings using a collaborative distance-constrained debiasing strategy. It also employs a two-stage text-guided sampling process to reduce generation quality trade-offs.

Result: LightFair significantly improves fairness in text-to-image generation on Stable Diffusion v1.5, achieving state-of-the-art debiasing performance with only one-fourth of the training burden and no increase in sampling load.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enhances fairness with minimal computational resources, making it a practical, efficient solution for real-world implementations of text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: This paper explores a novel lightweight approach LightFair to achieve fair
text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) by addressing the adverse effects of
the text encoder. Most existing methods either couple different parts of the
diffusion model for full-parameter training or rely on auxiliary networks for
correction. They incur heavy training or sampling burden and unsatisfactory
performance. Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text
encoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on
mitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings. To validate feasibility, we
observe that the text encoder's neutral embedding output shows substantial
skewness across image embeddings of various attributes in the CLIP space. More
importantly, the noise prediction network further amplifies this imbalance. To
finetune the text embedding, we propose a collaborative distance-constrained
debiasing strategy that balances embedding distances to improve fairness
without auxiliary references. However, mitigating bias can compromise the
original generation quality. To address this, we introduce a two-stage
text-guided sampling strategy to limit when the debiased text encoder
intervenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LightFair is effective and
efficient. Notably, on Stable Diffusion v1.5, our method achieves SOTA
debiasing at just $1/4$ of the training burden, with virtually no increase in
sampling burden. The code is available at https://github.com/boyuh/LightFair.

*Chengying She,Ben Wang,Xinran Zhang,Dongjie Fan,Jialu Zhang,Chengwei Chen,Lizhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientMIL introduces a linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification, reducing computational demands while achieving state-of-the-art results using efficient sequence models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational bottlenecks of current SOTA MIL methods that rely on quadratic-complexity attention mechanisms during WSIs classification.

Method: EfficientMIL uses Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) along with efficient sequence models like GRU, LSTM, and Mamba to replace self-attention mechanisms in Transformer-based MIL methods.

Result: EfficientMIL achieved superior accuracy and AUC metrics on TCGA-Lung and CAMELYON16 datasets, surpassing other state-of-the-art methods while significantly improving computational efficiency.

Conclusion: EfficientMIL offers a more computationally efficient and effective approach for WSIs classification, demonstrating strong performance across multiple histopathology datasets.

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) classification represents a fundamental challenge
in computational pathology, where multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged
as the dominant paradigm. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods rely on
attention mechanisms, achieving good performance but requiring substantial
computational resources due to quadratic complexity when processing hundreds of
thousands of patches. To address this computational bottleneck, we introduce
EfficientMIL, a novel linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification
with the patches selection module Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) that we
designed, replacing the quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in
Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient sequence models including
RNN-based GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model (SSM) Mamba. EfficientMIL achieves
significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL
methods across multiple histopathology datasets. On TCGA-Lung dataset,
EfficientMIL-Mamba achieved AUC of 0.976 and accuracy of 0.933, while on
CAMELYON16 dataset, EfficientMIL-GRU achieved AUC of 0.990 and accuracy of
0.975, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that APS is also more effective for patches selection than
conventional selection strategies.

*Peter Hönig,Stefan Thalhammer,Jean-Baptiste Weibel,Matthias Hirschmanner,Markus Vincze*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE is a model designed for category-level object pose estimation, eliminating reliance on discrete category labels and achieving enhanced generalization and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in object manipulation by robots, particularly in open environments with unknown objects. It seeks to enable robots to generalize object pose estimation beyond known categories.

Method: The method involves using SCOPE, which leverages diffusion-based modeling, DINOv2 features as continuous semantic priors, photorealistic training data, and a noise model for point normals. Cross-attention is employed to incorporate semantic priors.

Result: SCOPE reduced the Sim2Real gap, improved pose estimation metrics by 31.9%, and successfully generalized to unseen objects, achieving grasping success rates of up to 100%.

Conclusion: SCOPE demonstrates significant progress in category-level object pose estimation, showcasing robust generalization beyond known object categories and a strong potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Object manipulation requires accurate object pose estimation. In open
environments, robots encounter unknown objects, which requires semantic
understanding in order to generalize both to known categories and beyond. To
resolve this challenge, we present SCOPE, a diffusion-based category-level
object pose estimation model that eliminates the need for discrete category
labels by leveraging DINOv2 features as continuous semantic priors. By
combining these DINOv2 features with photorealistic training data and a noise
model for point normals, we reduce the Sim2Real gap in category-level object
pose estimation. Furthermore, injecting the continuous semantic priors via
cross-attention enables SCOPE to learn canonicalized object coordinate systems
across object instances beyond the distribution of known categories. SCOPE
outperforms the current state of the art in synthetically trained
category-level object pose estimation, achieving a relative improvement of
31.9\% on the 5$^\circ$5cm metric. Additional experiments on two instance-level
datasets demonstrate generalization beyond known object categories, enabling
grasping of unseen objects from unknown categories with a success rate of up to
100\%. Code available: https://github.com/hoenigpeter/scope.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a training-free approach to control image layouts using reference images instead of text, enabling precise object and part-level composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-based control in text-to-image models limits explicit guidance in achieving desired image layouts. There is a need for more precise methods that allow defining both content and placement within images.

Method: The approach uses a training-free method requiring only one image per reference, which enables controlling multi-image layouts by specifying content and placement through image inputs instead of text.

Result: The proposed method is shown to be effective in various image composition tasks, highlighting its capability for precise control and improved layouts.

Conclusion: This work provides an explicit, simple, and robust technique for object and part-level image composition, marking a step forward in overcoming text-based limitations in AI-driven image generation.

Abstract: Text-to-image models have achieved a level of realism that enables the
generation of highly convincing images. However, text-based control can be a
limiting factor when more explicit guidance is needed. Defining both the
content and its precise placement within an image is crucial for achieving
finer control. In this work, we address the challenge of multi-image layout
control, where the desired content is specified through images rather than
text, and the model is guided on where to place each element. Our approach is
training-free, requires a single image per reference, and provides explicit and
simple control for object and part-level composition. We demonstrate its
effectiveness across various image composition tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores how polarimetric imaging improves the segmentation of floating debris on water, addressing issues like glare and outdoor illumination. Benchmarked on the PoTATO dataset, it introduces polarimetric cues to enhance segmentation accuracy and reduce errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation of floating debris on water is hindered by glare and variations in outdoor lighting, necessitating improved methods for robust performance.

Method: The study benchmarks state-of-the-art fusion networks on the PoTATO dataset, incorporating polarimetric imaging to enhance segmentation by leveraging polarization cues.

Result: Polarimetric imaging improves segmentation, yielding higher mean IoU and lower contour errors compared to traditional RGB baselines. However, it increases computational load and poses risks of new false positives.

Conclusion: Polarimetric imaging is effective for mitigating glare and enhancing segmentation accuracy, but comes with trade-offs in computational complexity. The reproducible benchmark helps researchers evaluate its suitability for their needs.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of floating debris on water is often compromised by
surface glare and changing outdoor illumination. Polarimetric imaging offers a
single-sensor route to mitigate water-surface glare that disrupts semantic
segmentation of floating objects. We benchmark state-of-the-art fusion networks
on PoTATO, a public dataset of polarimetric images of plastic bottles in inland
waterways, and compare their performance with single-image baselines using
traditional models. Our results indicate that polarimetric cues help recover
low-contrast objects and suppress reflection-induced false positives, raising
mean IoU and lowering contour error relative to RGB inputs. These sharper masks
come at a cost: the additional channels enlarge the models increasing the
computational load and introducing the risk of new false positives. By
providing a reproducible, diagnostic benchmark and publicly available code, we
hope to help researchers choose if polarized cameras are suitable for their
applications and to accelerate related research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sparse-Up introduces a framework to tackle the trade-off between texture detail preservation and cross-view consistency in high-resolution 3D modeling, using sparse voxels and innovative partitioning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D asset modeling either lose fine texture details or suffer from inconsistencies due to resolution limits or outdated voxel handling.

Method: Sparse-Up employs sparse voxel guidance and introduces two strategies: surface anchoring (learnable upsampling near mesh surfaces) and view-domain partitioning (local patch-based gradient supervision).

Result: The framework significantly reduces memory usage during high-resolution voxel training while maintaining geometric consistency and preserving high-frequency texture details.

Conclusion: Sparse-Up improves texture fidelity and multi-view consistency in 3D modeling by overcoming limitations of traditional voxel approaches through novel techniques.

Abstract: The creation of high-fidelity 3D assets is often hindered by a 'pixel-level
pain point': the loss of high-frequency details. Existing methods often trade
off one aspect for another: either sacrificing cross-view consistency,
resulting in torn or drifting textures, or remaining trapped by the resolution
ceiling of explicit voxels, forfeiting fine texture detail. In this work, we
propose Sparse-Up, a memory-efficient, high-fidelity texture modeling framework
that effectively preserves high-frequency details. We use sparse voxels to
guide texture reconstruction and ensure multi-view consistency, while
leveraging surface anchoring and view-domain partitioning to break through
resolution constraints. Surface anchoring employs a learnable upsampling
strategy to constrain voxels to the mesh surface, eliminating over 70% of
redundant voxels present in traditional voxel upsampling. View-domain
partitioning introduces an image patch-guided voxel partitioning scheme,
supervising and back-propagating gradients only on visible local patches.
Through these two strategies, we can significantly reduce memory consumption
during high-resolution voxel training without sacrificing geometric
consistency, while preserving high-frequency details in textures.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ThermalGen, an adaptive flow-based generative model for RGB-to-thermal image translation to overcome the scarcity of paired RGB-thermal data for sensor fusion and cross-modality tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for paired RGB-thermal image data for advancements in visual-thermal sensor fusion and cross-modality tasks is hindered by the lack of synchronized and calibrated datasets.

Method: ThermalGen is a flow-based generative model incorporating an RGB image conditioning architecture and a style-disentangled mechanism. It uses eight curated public datasets and introduces three new large-scale datasets for training.

Result: ThermalGen achieves equal or superior RGB-to-thermal image translation performance compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: ThermalGen is the first model of its kind that effectively synthesizes thermal images under variances in viewpoints, sensor attributes, and environmental conditions.

Abstract: Paired RGB-thermal data is crucial for visual-thermal sensor fusion and
cross-modality tasks, including important applications such as multi-modal
image alignment and retrieval. However, the scarcity of synchronized and
calibrated RGB-thermal image pairs presents a major obstacle to progress in
these areas. To overcome this challenge, RGB-to-Thermal (RGB-T) image
translation has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the synthesis of
thermal images from abundant RGB datasets for training purposes. In this study,
we propose ThermalGen, an adaptive flow-based generative model for RGB-T image
translation, incorporating an RGB image conditioning architecture and a
style-disentangled mechanism. To support large-scale training, we curated eight
public satellite-aerial, aerial, and ground RGB-T paired datasets, and
introduced three new large-scale satellite-aerial RGB-T datasets--DJI-day,
Bosonplus-day, and Bosonplus-night--captured across diverse times, sensor
types, and geographic regions. Extensive evaluations across multiple RGB-T
benchmarks demonstrate that ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior
translation performance compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based
methods. To our knowledge, ThermalGen is the first RGB-T image translation
model capable of synthesizing thermal images that reflect significant
variations in viewpoints, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions.

TL;DR: ReWatch introduces a robust dataset and methodology to enhance video reasoning in large vision-language models. The work addresses data deficits in complex video-question tasks and shows state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for video reasoning lack multi-hop and high-quality grounded data, hindering advancements in complex video reasoning.

Method: Researchers developed ReWatch, a dataset synthesized using a multi-stage pipeline and a Multi-Agent ReAct framework that mimics human-like 're-watching' for reasoning generation. Also, a new RLVR training technique with Observation & Reasoning rewards was designed.

Result: ReWatch-R1 model achieves state-of-the-art performance across five video reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: ReWatch dataset and RLVR innovations enhance reasoning capabilities, reduce hallucination, and advance video reasoning tasks in LVLMs.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) significantly
advances image reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), its
application to complex video reasoning remains underdeveloped. This gap stems
primarily from a critical data bottleneck: existing datasets lack the
challenging, multi-hop questions and high-quality, video-grounded
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data necessary to effectively bootstrap RLVR. To address
this, we introduce ReWatch, a large-scale dataset built to foster advanced
video reasoning. We propose a novel multi-stage synthesis pipeline to
synthesize its three components: ReWatch-Caption, ReWatch-QA, and ReWatch-CoT.
A core innovation is our Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis, which
simulates a human-like "re-watching" process to generate video-grounded
reasoning traces by explicitly modeling information retrieval and verification.
Building on this dataset, we develop ReWatch-R1 by post-training a strong
baseline LVLM with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and our RLVR framework. This
framework incorporates a novel Observation \& Reasoning (O\&R) reward mechanism
that evaluates both the final answer's correctness and the reasoning's
alignment with video content, directly penalizing hallucination. Our
experiments show that ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance
on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks.

computational and financial costs. Different from the existing works,
LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 provides an open, efficient, and reproducible framework for
building high-quality vision-language models entirely from scratch. The
LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 release comprises three primary components: (1) Large-Scale
Curated Datasets: We construct an 85M concept-balanced pretraining dataset
LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Mid-Traning and a meticulously curated 26M instruction
dataset LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Instruct, collectively encompassing 64B compressed
multimodal tokens. (2) Efficient Training Framework: We develop a complete
end-to-end efficient training framework leveraging an offline parallel data
packing strategy to facilitate the training of LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 within a
$16,000 budget. (3) State-of-the-art Performance: Experimental results
demonstrate that LLaVA-OneVision1.5 yields exceptionally competitive
performance across a broad range of downstream tasks. Specifically,
LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-8B outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B on 18 of 27 benchmarks, and
LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-4B surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-3B on all 27 benchmarks. We
anticipate releasing LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-RL shortly and encourage the community
to await further updates.

### [479] [Fast Feature Field ($\text{F}^3$): A Predictive Representation of Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25146)
*Richeek Das,Kostas Daniilidis,Pratik Chaudhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Fast Feature Field ($\text{F}^3$) representation for event-based camera data, showcasing its efficiency, robustness, and effectiveness in various robotic task domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event-based cameras generate sparse and dynamic data compared to traditional cameras, posing challenges in extracting meaningful representations for tasks such as optical flow or depth estimation. This paper is motivated to provide a robust and efficient representation to address these challenges.

Method: The method involves learning the representation by predicting future events based on past events using multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets. This ensures both scene structure preservation and computational efficiency.

Result: The $	ext{F}^3$ representation achieves high performance (120 Hz at HD and 440 Hz at VGA resolutions) and state-of-the-art results on tasks like optical flow, segmentation, and depth estimation across diverse environments, conditions, and robotic platforms.

Conclusion: $	ext{F}^3$ demonstrates its versatility and efficiency, offering robust spatiotemporal representations for event data with impactful usage in robotic applications across challenging scenarios.

Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical argument and algorithms for building
representations of data from event-based cameras, that we call Fast Feature
Field ($\text{F}^3$). We learn this representation by predicting future events
from past events and show that it preserves scene structure and motion
information. $\text{F}^3$ exploits the sparsity of event data and is robust to
noise and variations in event rates. It can be computed efficiently using ideas
from multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets - achieving 120 Hz at HD and
440 Hz at VGA resolutions. $\text{F}^3$ represents events within a contiguous
spatiotemporal volume as a multi-channel image, enabling a range of downstream
tasks. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on optical flow estimation,
semantic segmentation, and monocular metric depth estimation, on data from
three robotic platforms (a car, a quadruped robot and a flying platform),
across different lighting conditions (daytime, nighttime), environments
(indoors, outdoors, urban, as well as off-road) and dynamic vision sensors
(resolutions and event rates). Our implementations can predict these tasks at
25-75 Hz at HD resolution.

### [480] [HIVTP: A Training-Free Method to Improve VLMs Efficiency via Hierarchical Visual Token Pruning Using Middle-Layer-Based Importance Score](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23663)
*Jingqi Xu,Jingxi Lu,Chenghao Li,Sreetama Sarkar,Peter A. Beerel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HIVTP, a hierarchical visual token pruning method to improve Vision-Language Models' efficiency, achieving faster inference without losing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face inefficiency during inference due to excessive visual tokens, many of which are unimportant.

Method: HIVTP uses a training-free hierarchical pruning technique, leveraging middle-layer attention maps to compute token importance and selectively prune tokens both globally and locally.

Result: HIVTP significantly reduces inference time (TTFT) by up to 55% and boosts token generation efficiency by up to 60%, maintaining or improving accuracy on certain tasks.

Conclusion: HIVTP enhances VLM efficiency while preserving accuracy, outperforming prior pruning methods in both speed and performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities on diverse
multimodal tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens output by the
vision encoder severely hinders inference efficiency, and prior studies have
shown that many of these tokens are not important and can therefore be safely
pruned. In this work, we propose HIVTP, a training-free method to improve VLMs
efficiency via hierarchical visual token pruning using a novel
middle-layer-based importance score. Specifically, we utilize attention maps
extracted from the middle layers of the vision encoder, which better reflect
fine-grained and object-level attention, to estimate visual token importance.
Based on this, we propose a hierarchical visual token pruning method to retain
both globally and locally important visual tokens. Specifically, we reshape the
1-D visual token sequence output by the vision encoder into a 2-D spatial
layout. In the global retaining stage, we divide the image into regions and
retain tokens with higher importance scores in each region; in the local
retaining stage, we then divide the image into small windows and retain the
most important token in each local window. Experimental results show that our
proposed method, HIVTP, can reduce the time-to-first-token (TTFT) of
LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaVA-Next-7B by up to 50.0% and 55.1%, respectively, and
improve the token generation throughput by up to 60.9% and 47.3%, without
sacrificing accuracy, and even achieving improvements on certain benchmarks.
Compared with prior works, HIVTP achieves better accuracy while offering higher
inference efficiency.

### [481] [Token Merging via Spatiotemporal Information Mining for Surgical Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23672)
*Xixi Jiang,Chen Yang,Dong Zhang,Pingcheng Dong,Xin Yang,Kwang-Ting Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STIM-TM improves efficiency in surgical video analysis by strategically merging spatiotemporal tokens, resulting in over 65% reduction in computation while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational bottlenecks in Vision Transformers when analyzing surgical videos due to the high cost of spatiotemporal token processing.

Method: The paper proposes STIM-TM, a token merging method that independently reduces redundancy in spatial and temporal dimensions while preserving essential information. This is done through saliency weighting and temporal stability analysis.

Result: STIM-TM achieves a significant 65% GFLOPs reduction without compromising performance, demonstrating competitive accuracy in various surgical video tasks.

Conclusion: STIM-TM offers a robust, training-free method for computationally efficient yet accurate analysis of long-sequence surgical videos, overcoming existing limitations in the field.

Abstract: Vision Transformer models have shown impressive effectiveness in the surgical
video understanding tasks through long-range dependency modeling. However,
current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to processing
massive spatiotemporal tokens across video frames. While prior work on token
merging has advanced model efficiency, they fail to adequately consider the
inherent spatiotemporal structure of video data and overlook the heterogeneous
nature of information distribution, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
paper, we propose a spatiotemporal information mining token merging (STIM-TM)
method, representing the first dedicated approach for surgical video
understanding. STIM-TM introduces a decoupled strategy that reduces token
redundancy along temporal and spatial dimensions independently. Specifically,
the temporal component merges spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive
frames using saliency weighting, preserving critical sequential information and
maintaining continuity. Meanwhile, the spatial component prioritizes merging
static tokens through temporal stability analysis, protecting dynamic regions
containing essential surgical information. Operating in a training-free manner,
STIM-TM achieves significant efficiency gains with over $65\%$ GFLOPs reduction
while preserving competitive accuracy across comprehensive surgical video
tasks. Our method also supports efficient training of long-sequence surgical
videos, addressing computational bottlenecks in surgical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Region Comprehension Index (RCI), a metric to distinguish whether vision-language benchmarks assess global reasoning or rely on localized cues. It reveals biases in existing benchmarks and aids in curating more balanced datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language benchmarks may overstate the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by relying on localized visual cues rather than true global reasoning. A systematic evaluation metric is needed to address this gap.

Method: The authors propose RCI, which evaluates models by comparing performance on isolated image patches versus full images, quantifying reliance on holistic understanding or local cues.

Result: RCI analysis on 13 benchmarks revealed a prevalence of spatial biases and a tendency toward localized reasoning rather than genuine global comprehension.

Conclusion: RCI provides a practical method for identifying and reducing spatial biases in vision-language datasets, aiding in the development of more robust and broadly applicable multimodal systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive results on
vision-language benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether these benchmarks
assess genuine global reasoning or allow success via localized visual cues.
Existing evaluation methods do not explicitly measure this distinction,
hindering effective dataset curation and real-world focused model development.
  We introduce Region Comprehension Index (RCI), the first model-based score to
directly quantify a dataset's reliance on global versus local visual
information. RCI systematically compares reference-model performance on image
patches versus full images, revealing if tasks require holistic image
understanding or can be solved with partial or localized visual cues.
  When applying RCI to 13 widely used multimodal benchmarks, we observed that
most of them favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases,
indicating potential risks in real-world applications. RCI equips researchers &
practitioners with an actionable tool for diagnosing & mitigating these biases,
enabling the construction of datasets and benchmarks to foster the development
of robust, enterprise-ready multimodal systems.

*Dayu Tan,Ziwei Zhang,Yansan Su,Xin Peng,Yike Dai,Chunhou Zheng,Weimin Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSD-KMamba, a novel 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework addressing the inefficiencies of CNN-Transformer hybrid models through innovative mechanisms that improve accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CNN-Transformer hybrid models for image segmentation suffer from high computational complexity and resource consumption, and fail to balance efficiency with high segmentation accuracy. This framework aims to address these issues.

Method: The authors propose MSD-KMamba, combining bidirectional spatial perception for capturing long-range dependencies and a multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy for hierarchical feature representation and improved semantic transfer.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show MSD-KMamba achieves better segmentation accuracy, robustness, and generalization compared to state-of-the-art methods, while being computationally efficient and scalable.

Conclusion: MSD-KMamba successfully balances computational efficiency and segmentation performance, mitigating the challenges of complex hybrid models. The public code ensures accessibility and reproducibility.

Abstract: Numerous CNN-Transformer hybrid models rely on high-complexity global
attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, which introduces
non-linear computational complexity and leads to significant resource
consumption. Although knowledge distillation and sparse attention mechanisms
can improve efficiency, they often fall short of delivering the high
segmentation accuracy necessary for complex tasks. Balancing model performance
with computational efficiency remains a critical challenge. In this work, we
propose a novel 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework, termed MSD-KMamba,
which integrates bidirectional spatial perception with multi-scale
self-distillation. The bidirectional spatial aware branch effectively captures
long-range spatial context dependencies across brain regions, while also
incorporating a powerful nonlinear feature extraction mechanism that further
enhances the model's ability to learn complex and heterogeneous patterns. In
addition, the proposed multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy strengthens
hierarchical feature representations and improves the transfer of semantic
information at different resolution levels. By jointly leveraging the
bidirectional spatial perception branch and the multi-scale self-distilled
fusion strategy, our framework effectively mitigates the bottleneck of
quadratic computational complexity in volumetric segmentation, while
simultaneously addressing the limitation of insufficient global perception.
Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MSD-KMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation
accuracy, robustness, and generalization, while maintaining high computational
efficiency and favorable scalability. The source code of MSD-KMamba is publicly
available at https://github.com/daimao-zhang/MSD-KMamba.

*Weilun Feng,Chuanguang Yang,Haotong Qin,Mingqiang Wu,Yuqi Li,Xiangqi Li,Zhulin An,Libo Huang,Yulun Zhang,Michele Magno,Yongjun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework called QuantSparse that combines model quantization with attention sparsification to improve video generation efficiency without significant performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video generation using diffusion transformers is computationally expensive, prompting the need for efficient compression methods like quantization and sparsification.

Method: QuantSparse incorporates Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation to reduce quantization bias and Second-Order Sparse Attention Reparameterization to recover information loss under sparsity.

Result: QuantSparse achieves significant improvements, including a PSNR of 20.88, outperforming Q-VDiT's 16.85 PSNR, along with 3.68× storage reduction and 1.88× inference acceleration.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully integrates compression techniques to enhance video generation performance and efficiency, showcasing promising results for practical deployment of diffusion transformers.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers exhibit remarkable video generation capability, yet
their prohibitive computational and memory costs hinder practical deployment.
Model quantization and attention sparsification are two promising directions
for compression, but each alone suffers severe performance degradation under
aggressive compression. Combining them promises compounded efficiency gains,
but naive integration is ineffective. The sparsity-induced information loss
exacerbates quantization noise, leading to amplified attention shifts. To
address this, we propose \textbf{QuantSparse}, a unified framework that
integrates model quantization with attention sparsification. Specifically, we
introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation}, which leverages
both global structural guidance and local salient supervision to mitigate
quantization-induced bias. In addition, we develop \textit{Second-Order Sparse
Attention Reparameterization}, which exploits the temporal stability of
second-order residuals to efficiently recover information lost under sparsity.
Experiments on HunyuanVideo-13B demonstrate that QuantSparse achieves 20.88
PSNR, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art quantization baseline
Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while simultaneously delivering a \textbf{3.68$\times$}
reduction in storage and \textbf{1.88$\times$} acceleration in end-to-end
inference. Our code will be released in

*Siyuan Gao,Jiashu Yao,Haoyu Wen,Yuhang Guo,Zeming Liu,Heyan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HomeSafeBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating embodied agents' abilities in home safety inspection tasks using Vision-Language Models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for assessing embodied agents in home safety tasks are inadequate—they use textual descriptions instead of visual input and rely on static viewpoints for observation, which fail to account for meaningful exploration and occluded hazards.

Method: The authors developed HomeSafeBench, featuring 12,900 data points across five home safety hazards. It uses dynamic first-person perspective visual inputs in simulated environments, allowing embodied agents to explore freely and enhance hazard detection.

Result: Comprehensive testing of mainstream VLMs on HomeSafeBench shows significant limitations, with the best-performing model achieving only a 10.23% F1-score. These models struggle with hazard identification and exploration strategies.

Conclusion: HomeSafeBench exposes the current challenges in VLM-based safety inspections and aims to become a valuable resource for advancing research in home security. The dataset and code will be made publicly available for further studies.

Abstract: Embodied agents can identify and report safety hazards in the home
environments. Accurately evaluating their capabilities in home safety
inspection tasks is curcial, but existing benchmarks suffer from two key
limitations. First, they oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual
descriptions of the environment instead of direct visual information, which
hinders the accurate evaluation of embodied agents based on Vision-Language
Models (VLMs). Second, they use a single, static viewpoint for environmental
observation, which restricts the agents' free exploration and cause the
omission of certain safety hazards, especially those that are occluded from a
fixed viewpoint. To alleviate these issues, we propose HomeSafeBench, a
benchmark with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards:
fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, and child safety. HomeSafeBench
provides dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home
environments, enabling the evaluation of VLM capabilities for home safety
inspection. By allowing the embodied agents to freely explore the room,
HomeSafeBench provides multiple dynamic perspectives in complex environments
for a more thorough inspection. Our comprehensive evaluation of mainstream VLMs
on HomeSafeBench reveals that even the best-performing model achieves an
F1-score of only 10.23%, demonstrating significant limitations in current VLMs.
The models particularly struggle with identifying safety hazards and selecting
effective exploration strategies. We hope HomeSafeBench will provide valuable
reference and support for future research related to home security inspections.
Our dataset and code will be publicly available soon.

*Atharva Jadhav,Arush Karekar,Manas Divekar,Shachi Natu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on enhancing surveillance weapon detection using an ensemble of SSD models with diverse feature extraction backbones combined via Weighted Boxes Fusion, achieving improved performance in challenging conditions (e.g., occlusions, lighting issues).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sophisticated surveillance systems are crucial for ensuring safety in public spaces, but they struggle with detecting weapons due to challenges like occlusion, varying lighting, and clutter, necessitating improved detection methods.

Method: The authors trained separate SSD models using VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNet, and MobileNetV3 backbones, then fused predictions using Weighted Boxes Fusion with confidence-aware strategies.

Result: The proposed method achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.838, a 2.948% relative improvement compared to the best-performing single model and showed consistent superiority over other fusion heuristics.

Conclusion: Confidence-aware fusion methods coupled with an ensemble of diverse SSD models significantly enhance real-time weapon detection accuracy in surveillance systems, showcasing robustness in challenging conditions.

Abstract: The safety and security of public spaces is of vital importance, driving the
need for sophisticated surveillance systems capable of accurately detecting
weapons, which are often hampered by issues like partial occlusion, varying
lighting, and cluttered backgrounds. While single-model detectors are advanced,
they often lack robustness in these challenging conditions. This paper presents
the hypothesis that ensemble of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) models with
diverse feature extraction backbones can significantly enhance detection
robustness. To leverage diverse feature representations, individual SSD models
were trained using a selection of backbone networks: VGG16, ResNet50,
EfficientNet, and MobileNetV3. The study is conducted on a dataset consisting
of images of three distinct weapon classes: guns, heavy weapons and knives. The
predictions from these models are combined using the Weighted Boxes Fusion
(WBF) method, an ensemble technique designed to optimize bounding box accuracy.
Our key finding is that the fusion strategy is as critical as the ensemble's
diversity, a WBF approach using a 'max' confidence scoring strategy achieved a
mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.838. This represents a 2.948% relative
improvement over the best-performing single model and consistently outperforms
other fusion heuristics. This research offers a robust approach to enhancing
real-time weapon detection capabilities in surveillance applications by
demonstrating that confidence-aware fusion is a key mechanism for improving
accuracy metrics of ensembles.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces INSTINCT, a framework enhancing collaborative perception with efficient bandwidth use and improved accuracy, demonstrated across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of single-vehicle perception systems in detecting long-range and occluded scenarios while addressing bandwidth constraints in collaborative perception.

Method: Proposes INSTINCT framework with instance feature selection, detection routing, cross-agent fusion module, and enhanced ground truth sampling for collaborative perception.

Result: Achieved 13.23%/33.08% accuracy improvement on DAIR-V2X and V2V4Real datasets with significant bandwidth reduction by up to 1/281 and 1/264 compared to state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: INSTINCT improves collaborative perception by efficiently handling data and achieving better detection accuracy with reduced bandwidth.

Abstract: Collaborative perception systems overcome single-vehicle limitations in
long-range detection and occlusion scenarios by integrating multi-agent sensory
data, improving accuracy and safety. However, frequent cooperative interactions
and real-time requirements impose stringent bandwidth constraints. Previous
works proves that query-based instance-level interaction reduces bandwidth
demands and manual priors, however, LiDAR-focused implementations in
collaborative perception remain underdeveloped, with performance still trailing
state-of-the-art approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose INSTINCT
(INSTance-level INteraCtion ArchiTecture), a novel collaborative perception
framework featuring three core components: 1) a quality-aware filtering
mechanism for high-quality instance feature selection; 2) a dual-branch
detection routing scheme to decouple collaboration-irrelevant and
collaboration-relevant instances; and 3) a Cross Agent Local Instance Fusion
module to aggregate local hybrid instance features. Additionally, we enhance
the ground truth (GT) sampling technique to facilitate training with diverse
hybrid instance features. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
demonstrate that INSTINCT achieves superior performance. Specifically, our
method achieves an improvement in accuracy 13.23%/33.08% in DAIR-V2X and
V2V4Real while reducing the communication bandwidth to 1/281 and 1/264 compared
to state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: CrimEdit is a unified model for object removal, insertion, and repositioning, using classifier-free guidance to handle object effects like shadows and reflections, achieving advanced performance without needing separate training stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the untapped potential of applying classifier-free guidance to object effects in object removal and insertion tasks, and to improve editing efficiency with a unified framework.

Method: The study introduces CrimEdit, a unified model that jointly trains embeddings for object removal and insertion tasks, applying classifier-free guidance to enhance object effect handling and enabling object repositioning in a single step.

Result: Experiments demonstrate CrimEdit's superior performance in object removal and effect control during insertion, as well as efficient repositioning, without requiring additional model training or separate task stages.

Conclusion: CrimEdit establishes an efficient and effective approach to composite image editing by unifying removal, insertion, and repositioning tasks under one guided model.

Abstract: Recent works on object removal and insertion have enhanced their performance
by handling object effects such as shadows and reflections, using diffusion
models trained on counterfactual datasets. However, the performance impact of
applying classifier-free guidance to handle object effects across removal and
insertion tasks within a unified model remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap and improve efficiency in composite editing, we propose CrimEdit,
which jointly trains the task embeddings for removal and insertion within a
single model and leverages them in a classifier-free guidance scheme --
enhancing the removal of both objects and their effects, and enabling
controllable synthesis of object effects during insertion. CrimEdit also
extends these two task prompts to be applied to spatially distinct regions,
enabling object movement (repositioning) within a single denoising step. By
employing both guidance techniques, extensive experiments show that CrimEdit
achieves superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient
object movement without requiring additional training or separate removal and
insertion stages.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PD-Diag-Net, an automated diagnostic method for Parkinson's disease (PD) using raw MRI scans, achieving high accuracy for early-stage detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current diagnostic workflows for Parkinson's disease, which are complex, reliant on neurologists' expertise, and prone to delays in early diagnosis.

Method: The proposed framework, PD-Diag-Net, preprocesses MRI scans and incorporates two clinical priors—Relevance-Prior and Aging-Prior—to guide feature aggregation and diagnosis. Two specific modules (Aggregator and Diagnoser) are designed to improve diagnostic focus and accuracy.

Result: PD-Diag-Net achieves 86% accuracy in external tests and over 96% accuracy in early-stage diagnosis, surpassing existing methods by more than 20%.

Conclusion: PD-Diag-Net represents a significant advancement in Parkinson's disease diagnosis, combining clinical priors and advanced imaging tools to improve diagnostic precision and timeliness.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that severely
diminishes patients' quality of life. Its global prevalence has increased
markedly in recent decades. Current diagnostic workflows are complex and
heavily reliant on neurologists' expertise, often resulting in delays in early
detection and missed opportunities for timely intervention. To address these
issues, we propose an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for PD, termed
PD-Diag-Net, which performs risk assessment and auxiliary diagnosis directly
from raw MRI scans. This framework first introduces an MRI Pre-processing
Module (MRI-Processor) to mitigate inter-subject and inter-scanner variability
by flexibly integrating established medical imaging preprocessing tools. It
then incorporates two forms of clinical prior knowledge: (1)
Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior (Relevance-Prior), which specifies brain regions
strongly associated with PD; and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (Aging-Prior),
which reflects the accelerated aging typically observed in PD-associated
regions. Building on these priors, we design two dedicated modules: the
Relevance-Prior Guided Feature Aggregation Module (Aggregator), which guides
the model to focus on PD-associated regions at the inter-subject level, and the
Age-Prior Guided Diagnosis Module (Diagnoser), which leverages brain age gaps
as auxiliary constraints at the intra-subject level to enhance diagnostic
accuracy and clinical interpretability. Furthermore, we collected external test
data from our collaborating hospital. Experimental results show that
PD-Diag-Net achieves 86\% accuracy on external tests and over 96% accuracy in
early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing advanced methods by more than
20%.

### [490] [DiffPCN: Latent Diffusion Model Based on Multi-view Depth Images for Point Cloud Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23723)
*Zijun Li,Hongyu Yan,Shijie Li,Kunming Luo,Li Lu,Xulei Yang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiffPCN, a diffusion-based framework for point cloud completion, addressing challenges with unstructured and irregular data. It includes coarse generation using depth images and refinement through denoising and upsampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point clouds are widely used in computer vision and 3D modeling, but their unstructured nature makes point cloud completion challenging. Existing methods struggle with achieving high-quality and complete results. The authors aim to leverage latent diffusion models for this task to fill the gap.

Method: The proposed framework, DiffPCN, operates in two stages: it first generates coarse point clouds from structured depth images using DepthLDM, then refines them through a Point Denoising Network and Association-Aware Point Upsampler.

Result: DiffPCN achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of geometric accuracy and shape completeness in point cloud completion tasks, showing improved robustness and consistency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that combining latent diffusion models with a coarse-to-fine approach effectively addresses point cloud completion challenges, providing an innovative solution for achieving high-quality results.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities across various low-level vision tasks. However, their potential
for point cloud completion remains underexplored due to the unstructured and
irregular nature of point clouds. In this work, we propose DiffPCN, a novel
diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework for point cloud completion. Our
approach comprises two stages: an initial stage for generating coarse point
clouds, and a refinement stage that improves their quality through point
denoising and upsampling. Specifically, we first project the unordered and
irregular partial point cloud into structured depth images, which serve as
conditions for a well-designed DepthLDM to synthesize completed multi-view
depth images that are used to form coarse point clouds. In this way, our
DiffPCN can yield high-quality and high-completeness coarse point clouds by
leveraging LDM' s powerful generation and comprehension capabilities. Then,
since LDMs inevitably introduce outliers into the generated depth maps, we
design a Point Denoising Network to remove artifacts from the coarse point
cloud by predicting a per-point distance score. Finally, we devise an
Association-Aware Point Upsampler, which guides the upsampling process by
leveraging local association features between the input point cloud and the
corresponding coarse points, further yielding a dense and high-fidelity output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our DiffPCN achieves state-of-the-art
performance in geometric accuracy and shape completeness, significantly
improving the robustness and consistency of point cloud completion.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lagging performance of video-language models in long-video understanding compared to image or short-video tasks, the authors aim to improve existing models' performance without additional training.

Method: The paper introduces a visual prompting strategy where multiple frames are combined into panels within a single image. This method trades spatial details for temporal resolution, is training-free, parameter-free, model-agnostic, and integrates seamlessly into existing models.

Result: Experiments on five benchmarks confirm consistent improvements across various models and datasets. Notably, the method improves video question answering accuracy by up to 19.4% on the TimeScope (Long) dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly enhances long-video understanding in VLMs, is simple to apply, and is effective in improving performance without fine-tuning or additional complexity.

Abstract: Recent Video-Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results on long-video
understanding, but their performance still lags behind that achieved on tasks
involving images or short videos. This has led to great interest in improving
the long context modeling of VLMs by introducing novel modules and additional
complexity. % additional training time. In this paper, we take a different
approach: rather than fine-tuning VLMs with the limited data available, we
attempt to maximize the performance of existing models. To this end, we propose
a novel visual prompting strategy specifically designed for long-video
understanding. By combining multiple frames as panels into one image, we
effectively trade off spatial details for temporal resolution. Our approach is
training-free, parameter-free, and model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing VLMs. Extensive experiments on five established
benchmarks across a wide range of model architectures, sizes, and context
windows confirm the consistency of our approach. For the TimeScope (Long)
dataset, which has the longest videos, the accuracy for video question
answering is improved by up to 19.4\%. Overall, our method raises the bar for
long video understanding models. We will make our code available upon
acceptance.

*Yiheng Zhang,Zhuojiang Cai,Mingdao Wang,Meitong Guo,Tianxiao Li,Li Lin,Yuwang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces M3DLayout, a dataset aimed at improving text-driven 3D indoor layout generation by providing diverse and detailed annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D indoor layout generation models are limited by small-scale, homogeneous datasets with inadequate annotations.

Method: The authors constructed M3DLayout, a dataset with 15,080 layouts derived from scans, CAD designs, and procedural scenes, with structured text annotations describing scene details.

Result: A benchmark using a text-conditioned diffusion model demonstrates M3DLayout's effectiveness in enhancing spatial and semantic learning capabilities.

Conclusion: M3DLayout offers a robust foundation for training advanced 3D layout generation models and aims to drive progress in text-driven 3D scene synthesis.

Abstract: In text-driven 3D scene generation, object layout serves as a crucial
intermediate representation that bridges high-level language instructions with
detailed geometric output. It not only provides a structural blueprint for
ensuring physical plausibility but also supports semantic controllability and
interactive editing. However, the learning capabilities of current 3D indoor
layout generation models are constrained by the limited scale, diversity, and
annotation quality of existing datasets. To address this, we introduce
M3DLayout, a large-scale, multi-source dataset for 3D indoor layout generation.
M3DLayout comprises 15,080 layouts and over 258k object instances, integrating
three distinct sources: real-world scans, professional CAD designs, and
procedurally generated scenes. Each layout is paired with detailed structured
text describing global scene summaries, relational placements of large
furniture, and fine-grained arrangements of smaller items. This diverse and
richly annotated resource enables models to learn complex spatial and semantic
patterns across a wide variety of indoor environments. To assess the potential
of M3DLayout, we establish a benchmark using a text-conditioned diffusion
model. Experimental results demonstrate that our dataset provides a solid
foundation for training layout generation models. Its multi-source composition
enhances diversity, notably through the Inf3DLayout subset which provides rich
small-object information, enabling the generation of more complex and detailed
scenes. We hope that M3DLayout can serve as a valuable resource for advancing
research in text-driven 3D scene synthesis.

### [493] [LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23729)
*Shubhang Bhatnagar,Andy Xu,Kar-Han Tan,Narendra Ahuja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a strategy for ultra-low bit quantization in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by exploiting variance across layers and integrating mixed multimodal tokens, achieving substantial memory savings with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this study is the inefficiency of deploying multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to their high memory and computational requirements, and the lack of exploration into ultra-low bit quantization (<4-bit) for these models.

Method: The authors analyze the statistical properties of multimodal tokens, revealing their sensitivity to ultra-low precision. They propose LUQ (Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization), selectively applying such quantization to layers more resistant to it, and use mixed multimodal tokens during post-training quantization to further enhance performance.

Result: The proposed LUQ method reduces memory usage by 40% and 31% for LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL models compared to 4-bit quantization while maintaining less than 10% performance degradation on the MME benchmark.

Conclusion: Ultra-low bit quantization can be effectively implemented for MLLMs by strategically targeting layers with lower entropy and incorporating mixed multimodal tokens during post-training quantization, achieving significant memory efficiency with minimal performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal capabilities have revolutionized
vision-language tasks, but their deployment often requires huge memory and
computational resources. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has
successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without
significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs)
remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on
ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them
exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text
tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the
activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over
different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation
distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better
tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a
novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit
Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers
that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of
multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the
ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL
across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less
memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a
performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.

*Cong Chen,Ziyuan Huang,Cheng Zou,Muzhi Zhu,Kaixiang Ji,Jiajia Liu,Jingdong Chen,Hao Chen,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HieraTok, a multi-scale Vision Transformer (ViT) tokenizer, achieving significant advancements in image reconstruction and generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of single-scale representations in ViT tokenizers and improve performance in visual generation tasks.

Method: Proposes two key designs: (1) multi-scale downsampling to produce multi-scale tokens, and (2) a scale-causal attention mechanism for progressive information flow.

Result: HieraTok outperforms single-scale tokenizers with 27.2% rFID improvement, 1.38x faster convergence, and an 18.9% gFID boost. Achieves state-of-the-art performance by scaling up the tokenizer's training.

Conclusion: HieraTok demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-scale ViT tokenization in improving image reconstruction and generation, setting new benchmarks for the field.

Abstract: In this work, we present HieraTok, a novel multi-scale Vision Transformer
(ViT)-based tokenizer that overcomes the inherent limitation of modeling
single-scale representations. This is realized through two key designs: (1)
multi-scale downsampling applied to the token map generated by the tokenizer
encoder, producing a sequence of multi-scale tokens, and (2) a scale-causal
attention mechanism that enables the progressive flow of information from
low-resolution global semantic features to high-resolution structural details.
Coupling these designs, HieraTok achieves significant improvements in both
image reconstruction and generation tasks. Under identical settings, the
multi-scale visual tokenizer outperforms its single-scale counterpart by a
27.2\% improvement in rFID ($1.47 \rightarrow 1.07$). When integrated into
downstream generation frameworks, it achieves a $1.38\times$ faster convergence
rate and an 18.9\% boost in gFID ($16.4 \rightarrow 13.3$), which may be
attributed to the smoother and more uniformly distributed latent space.
Furthermore, by scaling up the tokenizer's training, we demonstrate its
potential by a sota rFID of 0.45 and a gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce multi-scale ViT-based
tokenizer in image reconstruction and image generation. We hope our findings
and designs advance the ViT-based tokenizers in visual generation tasks.

*Xincheng Yao,Chao Shi,Muming Zhao,Guangtao Zhai,Chongyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ResAD, a framework for class-agnostic anomaly detection using residual features to overcome class-related representation issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods struggle to generalize across diverse classes and domains, due to class-related representation learning.

Method: The authors propose ResAD using residual feature distribution and spatial hypersphere constraints to decorrelate features, combined with advanced techniques (logbarrier loss) for improved detection.

Result: ResAD++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in anomaly detection for diverse classes on eight real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is promising for generalized anomaly detection without retraining, addressing both feature correlation and scale issues.

Abstract: This paper explores the problem of class-agnostic anomaly detection (AD),
where the objective is to train one class-agnostic AD model that can generalize
to detect anomalies in diverse new classes from different domains without any
retraining or fine-tuning on the target data. When applied for new classes, the
performance of current single- and multi-class AD methods is still
unsatisfactory. One fundamental reason is that representation learning in
existing methods is still class-related, namely, feature correlation. To
address this issue, we propose residual features and construct a simple but
effective framework, termed ResAD. Our core insight is to learn the residual
feature distribution rather than the initial feature distribution. Residual
features are formed by matching and then subtracting normal reference features.
In this way, we can effectively realize feature decorrelation. Even in new
classes, the distribution of normal residual features would not remarkably
shift from the learned distribution. In addition, we think that residual
features still have one issue: scale correlation. To this end, we propose a
feature hypersphere constraining approach, which learns to constrain initial
normal residual features into a spatial hypersphere for enabling the feature
scales of different classes as consistent as possible. Furthermore, we propose
a novel logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss and vector quantization
based feature distribution matching module to enhance ResAD, leading to the
improved version of ResAD (ResAD++). Comprehensive experiments on eight
real-world AD datasets demonstrate that our ResAD++ can achieve remarkable AD
results when directly used in new classes, outperforming state-of-the-art
competing methods and also surpassing ResAD. The code is available at

*Wenjie Yang,Zengfeng Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Poivre, a self-refining procedure for visual pointing tasks that uses reinforcement learning to iteratively refine predictions. The proposed Poivre-7B model surpasses previous state-of-the-art benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs underperform compared to humans in visual pointing tasks, largely due to their inability to revise predictions iteratively, unlike human counterparts.

Method: The authors propose the 'Point, Visualize, then Refine' (Poivre) procedure combined with reinforcement learning to enhance VLMs' self-refining capabilities. A process reward is used for training.

Result: The Poivre-7B model sets a new state-of-the-art performance on the Point-Bench benchmark, outperforming both proprietary and larger-scale open-source models.

Conclusion: Poivre-7B demonstrates iterative refinement significantly improves visual pointing in VLMs, with practical applications and open-source contributions promoting future research.

Abstract: Visual pointing, which aims to localize a target by predicting its
coordinates on an image, has emerged as an important problem in the realm of
vision-language models (VLMs). Despite its broad applicability, recent
benchmarks show that current VLMs still fall far behind human performance on
this task. A key limitation is that VLMs are typically required to complete the
pointing task in a single step, akin to asking humans to point at an object
without seeing their own fingers. To address this issue, we propose a simple
yet effective self-refining procedure: Point, Visualize, then Refine (Poivre).
This procedure enables a VLM to first mark its estimated point, then
iteratively refine the coordinates if necessary. Inspired by advances of
reasoning models in the natural language domain, we employ reinforcement
learning (RL) to incentivize this self-refining ability. For the RL training,
we design a neat process reward that is not only empirically effective but also
grounded in appealing properties. Our trained model, Poivre-7B, sets a new
state of the art on Point-Bench, outperforming both proprietary models such as
Gemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source models such as Molmo-72B by over 3%. To
support future research, we release our training and inference code, dataset,
and the Poivre-7B checkpoint.

TL;DR: The study introduces PVTAdpNet, a novel model for accurate and real-time polyp segmentation in colorectal cancer diagnosis, featuring state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Colorectal cancer remains one of the most common and deadly cancers, necessitating improved methods for early detection and treatment. Traditional colonoscopy faces challenges such as high miss rates caused by the variability of polyps, highlighting the need for more reliable solutions.

Method: The paper proposes PVTAdpNet, which utilizes a U-Net-style encoder-decoder integrated with a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone, novel residual blocks, and adapter-based skip connections. The design also includes squeeze-and-excitation attention mechanisms for enhanced channel-wise feature refinement.

Result: PVTAdpNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in polyp segmentation by achieving a high Dice coefficient of 0.8851 and an mIoU of 0.8167 on out-of-distribution polyp datasets. It also excels in real-time and accurate performance on the PolypGen dataset.

Conclusion: PVTAdpNet offers a significant advancement in polyp segmentation for colorectal cancer diagnosis, making it highly suitable for clinical applications and setting a new benchmark with its high accuracy and real-time performance.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer ranks among the most common and deadly cancers, emphasizing
the need for effective early detection and treatment. To address the
limitations of traditional colonoscopy, including high miss rates due to polyp
variability, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer Adapter Residual
Network (PVTAdpNet). This model integrates a U-Net-style encoder-decoder
structure with a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone, novel residual blocks,
and adapter-based skip connections. The design enhances feature extraction,
dense prediction, and gradient flow, supported by squeeze-and-excitation
attention for improved channel-wise feature refinement. PVTAdpNet achieves
real-time, accurate polyp segmentation, demonstrating superior performance on
benchmark datasets with high mDice and mIoU scores, making it highly suitable
for clinical applications. PVTAdpNet obtains a high Dice coefficient of 0.8851
and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8167 on out-of-distribution
polyp datasets. Evaluation of the PolypGen dataset demonstrates PVTAdpNet's
capability for real-time, accurate performance within familiar distributions.

TL;DR: This paper introduces UniAlignment, a unified multimodal diffusion model for generating tasks, which improves semantic consistency and instruction-following using a novel dual-stream training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address limitations in multi-modal tasks that require semantic comprehension of visual and textual input by creating a unified, efficient framework.

Method: The paper proposes a unified diffusion transformer architecture called UniAlignment, featuring dual-stream diffusion training for semantic alignment within and across modalities. It also introduces a benchmark, SemGen-Bench, for evaluating multimodal semantic consistency.

Result: UniAlignment demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods across various multimodal tasks and benchmarks, ensuring better cross-modal consistency and robust instruction-following.

Conclusion: The results showcase the potential of diffusion models in multimodal generation, offering improvements in both computational efficiency and semantic understanding in complex scenarios.

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image generation has
sparked growing interest in expanding their capabilities to a variety of
multi-modal tasks, including image understanding, manipulation, and perception.
These tasks require advanced semantic comprehension across both visual and
textual modalities, especially in scenarios involving complex semantic
instructions. However, existing approaches often rely heavily on
vision-language models (VLMs) or modular designs for semantic guidance, leading
to fragmented architectures and computational inefficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose UniAlignment, a unified multimodal generation framework
within a single diffusion transformer. UniAlignment introduces a dual-stream
diffusion training strategy that incorporates both intrinsic-modal semantic
alignment and cross-modal semantic alignment, thereby enhancing the model's
cross-modal consistency and instruction-following robustness. Additionally, we
present SemGen-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
multimodal semantic consistency under complex textual instructions. Extensive
experiments across multiple tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that UniAlignment
outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the significant potential of
diffusion models in unified multimodal generation.

*Xiaojie Li,Bei Wang,Jianlong Wu,Yue Yu,Liqiang Nie,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenView++ enhances contrastive learning by constructing better positive pairs via adaptive view generation and utilizing a quality-driven reweighting mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current contrastive learning methods suffer from limited diversity and semantic corruption in positive pair construction and lack mechanisms for assessing pair quality in learning.

Method: The paper introduces GenView++, which employs a multi-source adaptive view generation mechanism for view diversity and a quality-driven contrastive learning mechanism to prioritize high-quality pairs.

Result: GenView++ improves MoCov2 by +2.5% on ImageNet linear classification, enhances zero-shot classification accuracy by +12.31% (CLIP) and +5.31% (SLIP) across multiple datasets, and boosts Flickr30k text retrieval R@5 by +3.2%.

Conclusion: GenView++ addresses critical challenges in contrastive learning by improving both pair construction and learning processes, leading to better vision and vision-language representation.

Abstract: The success of contrastive learning depends on the construction and
utilization of high-quality positive pairs. However, current methods face
critical limitations on two fronts: on the construction side, both handcrafted
and generative augmentations often suffer from limited diversity and risk
semantic corruption; on the learning side, the absence of a quality assessment
mechanism leads to suboptimal supervision where all pairs are treated equally.
To tackle these challenges, we propose GenView++, a unified framework that
addresses both fronts by introducing two synergistic innovations. To improve
pair construction, GenView++ introduces a multi-source adaptive view generation
mechanism to synthesize diverse yet semantically coherent views by dynamically
modulating generative parameters across image-conditioned, text-conditioned,
and image-text-conditioned strategies. Second, a quality-driven contrastive
learning mechanism assesses each pair's semantic alignment and diversity to
dynamically reweight their training contribution, prioritizing high-quality
pairs while suppressing redundant or misaligned pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of GenView++ across both vision and
vision-language tasks. For vision representation learning, it improves MoCov2
by +2.5% on ImageNet linear classification. For vision-language learning, it
raises the average zero-shot classification accuracy by +12.31% over CLIP and
+5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets, and further improves Flickr30k text
retrieval R@5 by +3.2%. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTGRR is a novel graph-based framework for urban region modeling that uses modality-specific graph approaches and spatially-aware fusion to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based models for multimodal urban data fail to incorporate modality-specific architectures and ignore spatial heterogeneity, leading to suboptimal region representations.

Method: MTGRR introduces modality-specific processing by categorizing into aggregated-level and point-level modalities for graph design. It employs a spatially-aware fusion mechanism and a joint contrastive learning strategy for optimizing representation.

Result: MTGRR achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods across two datasets, six modalities, and three tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The paper presents an advanced graph framework that effectively models multimodal urban data by addressing previous limitations and offering improved region representations.

Abstract: Graph-based models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling
multimodal urban data and learning region representations for various
downstream tasks. However, existing approaches face two major limitations. (1)
They typically employ identical graph neural network architectures across all
modalities, failing to capture modality-specific structures and
characteristics. (2) During the fusion stage, they often neglect spatial
heterogeneity by assuming that the aggregation weights of different modalities
remain invariant across regions, resulting in suboptimal representations. To
address these issues, we propose MTGRR, a modality-tailored graph modeling
framework for urban region representation, built upon a multimodal dataset
comprising point of interest (POI), taxi mobility, land use, road element,
remote sensing, and street view images. (1) MTGRR categorizes modalities into
two groups based on spatial density and data characteristics: aggregated-level
and point-level modalities. For aggregated-level modalities, MTGRR employs a
mixture-of-experts (MoE) graph architecture, where each modality is processed
by a dedicated expert GNN to capture distinct modality-specific
characteristics. For the point-level modality, a dual-level GNN is constructed
to extract fine-grained visual semantic features. (2) To obtain effective
region representations under spatial heterogeneity, a spatially-aware
multimodal fusion mechanism is designed to dynamically infer region-specific
modality fusion weights. Building on this graph modeling framework, MTGRR
further employs a joint contrastive learning strategy that integrates region
aggregated-level, point-level, and fusion-level objectives to optimize region
representations. Experiments on two real-world datasets across six modalities
and three tasks demonstrate that MTGRR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes improvements to vector-quantization-based generative models for visual prior modeling, introducing techniques to reduce quantization errors and enhance prediction accuracy, specifically for super-resolution tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vector-quantization methods suffer from large quantization errors and sub-optimal accuracy due to code-level supervision without considering reconstruction errors.

Method: Proposed two strategies: (1) Texture Vector-Quantization, which models missing textures for super-resolution, and (2) Reconstruction Aware Prediction, using image-level supervision with the straight-through estimator.

Result: The proposed model, TVQ&RAP, achieves photo-realistic super-resolution results efficiently with low computational requirements.

Conclusion: The introduced strategies effectively address quantization errors and optimize prior modeling, advancing generative super-resolution performance.

Abstract: Vector-quantized based models have recently demonstrated strong potential for
visual prior modeling. However, existing VQ-based methods simply encode visual
features with nearest codebook items and train index predictor with code-level
supervision. Due to the richness of visual signal, VQ encoding often leads to
large quantization error. Furthermore, training predictor with code-level
supervision can not take the final reconstruction errors into consideration,
result in sub-optimal prior modeling accuracy. In this paper we address the
above two issues and propose a Texture Vector-Quantization and a Reconstruction
Aware Prediction strategy. The texture vector-quantization strategy leverages
the task character of super-resolution and only introduce codebook to model the
prior of missing textures. While the reconstruction aware prediction strategy
makes use of the straight-through estimator to directly train index predictor
with image-level supervision. Our proposed generative SR model (TVQ&RAP) is
able to deliver photo-realistic SR results with small computational cost.

TL;DR: GroupCoOp proposes a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for vision-language models (VLMs) to address robustness issues caused by group imbalances in training datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of fine-tuned VLMs to spurious correlations due to subgroup imbalance in fine-tuning datasets.

Method: GroupCoOp introduces group-specific text prompts as representatives for different subgroups, utilizing the semantic knowledge of VLM text encoders to enhance robustness.

Result: Achieved top performance on five benchmarks for five CLIP architectures, surpassing methods requiring fine-tuning of the entire network while modifying only 0.016% of the network's parameters.

Conclusion: GroupCoOp effectively enhances group robustness in fine-tuned VLMs, demonstrating its efficiency and capability to handle group-imbalanced data while being resource-efficient.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of vision-language models (VLMs)
excels in various vision tasks thanks to the rich knowledge and generalization
ability of VLMs. However, recent studies revealed that such fine-tuned VLMs are
vulnerable to spurious correlations stemming from the subgroup imbalance in the
fine-tuning datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Group Context
Optimization (GroupCoOp), a simple and effective debiased fine-tuning algorithm
that enhances the group robustness of fine-tuned VLMs. Its key idea is to
employ group-specific text prompts as group representatives serving as multiple
classifiers for their target class. The rich semantic knowledge of the text
encoder of VLM enables the discovery of effective group prompts even for groups
with a small number of training samples. Leveraging the group prompts for each
class addresses the issues caused by the group-imbalanced training set, such as
the neglect of minority groups and the scattered distribution of each class in
the embedding space. GroupCoOp achieved the best results on five benchmarks
across five CLIP architectures and occasionally outperformed prior methods that
fine-tune the entire network, despite training only 0.016\% of the network's
parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to address the challenge of ensuring high-quality, industry-standard environments in automatically generated game levels, as current PCG techniques often produce unstable or unplayable levels.

Method: The proposed method involves using object segmentation and visual analysis of level images to detect structural gaps and make targeted repairs. Multiple object segmentation models are evaluated to select the best one for the repair pipeline.

Result: Experimental results show that the method enhances the stability and playability of AI-generated levels for Angry Birds, although the approach can generalize to other 2D games.

Conclusion: The research concludes that their image-based approach offers effective level repair capabilities and has potential applicability in various 2D games with similar structures.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) techniques enable automatic creation of
diverse and complex environments. While PCG facilitates more efficient content
creation, ensuring consistently high-quality, industry-standard content remains
a significant challenge. In this research, we propose a method to identify and
repair unstable levels generated by existing PCG models. We use Angry Birds as
a case study, demonstrating our method on game levels produced by established
PCG approaches. Our method leverages object segmentation and visual analysis of
level images to detect structural gaps and perform targeted repairs. We
evaluate multiple object segmentation models and select the most effective one
as the basis for our repair pipeline. Experimental results show that our method
improves the stability and playability of AI-generated levels. Although our
evaluation is specific to Angry Birds, our image-based approach is designed to
be applicable to a wide range of 2D games with similar level structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing urban modeling methods, such as lack of geometric continuity, scalability, and parcel semantics in urban layout generation.

Method: The proposed framework fuses geometric and semantic attributes, introduces edge weights, and embeds building height in graphs to transition from 2D layouts to controllable and realistic 3D structures.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the method generates valid, scalable urban models that integrate geometry and semantics effectively.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical tool for data-driven planning and design, enabling direct user control and incorporation of realistic urban details.

Abstract: Urban modeling is essential for city planning, scene synthesis, and gaming.
Existing image-based methods generate diverse layouts but often lack geometric
continuity and scalability, while graph-based methods capture structural
relations yet overlook parcel semantics. We present a controllable framework
for large-scale 3D vector urban layout generation, conditioned on both geometry
and semantics. By fusing geometric and semantic attributes, introducing edge
weights, and embedding building height in the graph, our method extends 2D
layouts to realistic 3D structures. It also enables users to directly control
the output by modifying semantic attributes. Experiments show that it produces
valid, large-scale urban models, offering an effective tool for data-driven

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiencies and limitations of single-view imaging or manual inspections in manufacturing quality control, which can lead to downtime, increased costs, and inaccuracies.

Method: Developed a multi-camera imaging system integrated with object detection algorithms and image fusion methodologies, supported by a diverse annotated dataset facilitating robust analysis.

Result: The approach achieved high precision and recall in identifying improperly fastened components, significantly outperforming single-view methods in experimental tests.

Conclusion: The system provides a scalable, accurate, and cost-effective solution for industrial quality control, ensuring safety and reliability of assembly lines; plus, the public dataset encourages further research.

Abstract: Quality control is a critical aspect of manufacturing, particularly in
ensuring the proper assembly of small components in production lines. Existing
solutions often rely on single-view imaging or manual inspection, which are
prone to errors due to occlusions, restricted perspectives, or lighting
inconsistencies. These limitations require the installation of additional
inspection stations, which could disrupt the assembly line and lead to
increased downtime and costs. This paper introduces a novel multi-view quality
control module designed to address these challenges, integrating a multi-camera
imaging system with advanced object detection algorithms. By capturing images
from three camera views, the system provides comprehensive visual coverage of
components of an assembly process. A tailored image fusion methodology combines
results from multiple views, effectively resolving ambiguities and enhancing
detection reliability. To support this system, we developed a unique dataset
comprising annotated images across diverse scenarios, including varied lighting
conditions, occlusions, and angles, to enhance applicability in real-world
manufacturing environments. Experimental results show that our approach
significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and
recall rates in the identification of improperly fastened small assembly parts
such as screws. This work contributes to industrial automation by overcoming
single-view limitations, and providing a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate
quality control mechanism that ensures the reliability and safety of the
assembly line. The dataset used in this study is publicly available to
facilitate further research in this domain.

*Efthymios Tsaprazlis,Tiantian Feng,Anil Ramakrishna,Rahul Gupta,Shrikanth Narayanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Visual Privacy Taxonomy and evaluates Vision-Language Models' (VLMs) understanding of privacy, revealing significant limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the ability of AI models, particularly Vision-Language Models, to grasp and enforce privacy principles, which is currently a critical limitation.

Method: The authors developed a multi-level Visual Privacy Taxonomy designed to be scalable and adaptable and evaluated several state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models to measure their understanding of contextual privacy.

Result: The evaluation demonstrated that these state-of-the-art models showed significant inconsistencies in their understanding of contextual privacy.

Conclusion: The study highlights the critical need for more robust, privacy-aware AI systems and provides both a foundational taxonomy for future research and a benchmark to identify current limitations.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence have profoundly transformed the technological
landscape in recent years. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive abilities in reasoning, text comprehension, contextual pattern
recognition, and integrating language with visual understanding. While these
advances offer significant benefits, they also reveal critical limitations in
the models' ability to grasp the notion of privacy. There is hence substantial
interest in determining if and how these models can understand and enforce
privacy principles, particularly given the lack of supporting resources to test
such a task. In this work, we address these challenges by examining how legal
frameworks can inform the capabilities of these emerging technologies. To this
end, we introduce a comprehensive, multi-level Visual Privacy Taxonomy that
captures a wide range of privacy issues, designed to be scalable and adaptable
to existing and future research needs. Furthermore, we evaluate the
capabilities of several state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
revealing significant inconsistencies in their understanding of contextual
privacy. Our work contributes both a foundational taxonomy for future research
and a critical benchmark of current model limitations, demonstrating the urgent
need for more robust, privacy-aware AI systems.

*Hanyu Zhou,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Uni4D-LLM, a unified vision-language model designed for 4D scene understanding and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of extending the unification of vision-language models from 2D to the dynamic 4D spatiotemporal domain, which is essential for achieving comprehensive scene understanding and generation.

Method: The authors designed a shared visual representation incorporating semantic and appearance features with 4D geometric cues through adaptive cross-attention, built on a Transformer-based shared architecture with autoregressive and diffusion task-specific heads.

Result: Uni4D-LLM achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its ability to unify 4D scene understanding and generation.

Conclusion: By aligning visual and linguistic representations within a single model, Uni4D-LLM provides an effective framework for handling both understanding and generation tasks in dynamic 4D scenes, representing significant progress in unified vision-language modeling.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in 2D
scene understanding and generation, but extending this unification to the
physical world remains an open challenge. Existing 3D and 4D approaches
typically embed scene geometry into autoregressive model for semantic
understanding and diffusion model for content generation. This paradigm gap
prevents a single model from jointly handling both tasks, especially in dynamic
4D settings where spatiotemporal modeling is critical. We propose Uni4D-LLM,
the first unified VLM framework with spatiotemporal awareness for 4D scene
understanding and generation. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1)
Unification requires a shared representation. We extract semantic features for
understanding and noisy-injected appearance features for generation,
incorporate 4D geometric cues, and fuse them into a spatiotemporal-aware visual
representation through adaptive cross-attention. 2) Unification requires a
shared architecture. Both autoregression and diffusion are built on Transformer
backbones, and this enables integration into a single LLM with task-specific
heads. By aligning visual and linguistic representations, our Uni4D-LLM
produces predictions for both understanding and generation within one
Transformer-based framework. We further apply instruction fine-tuning on
diverse 4D vision-language datasets to improve generalization across tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Uni4D-LLM
achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art models
and offers the first true unification of 4D scene understanding and generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the SeC framework in zero-shot video object segmentation using the MOSEv2 dataset, achieving second place in a major challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing video object segmentation methods, specifically the lack of semantic understanding in handling challenges like occlusions and scene shifts.

Method: Utilizing the Segment Concept (SeC) framework, which leverages a Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) for semantic understanding without fine-tuning.

Result: SeC achieved 39.7 \JFn on the MOSEv2 test set and secured 2nd place in the Complex VOS track of a global challenge.

Conclusion: SeC proves to enhance robustness in video object segmentation by leveraging high-level semantic understanding through LVLM, even in zero-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation aims to segment a specified target
throughout a video sequence, initialized by a first-frame mask. Previous
methods rely heavily on appearance-based pattern matching and thus exhibit
limited robustness against challenges such as drastic visual changes,
occlusions, and scene shifts. This failure is often attributed to a lack of
high-level conceptual understanding of the target. The recently proposed
Segment Concept (SeC) framework mitigated this limitation by using a Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to establish a deep semantic understanding of the
object for more persistent segmentation. In this work, we evaluate its
zero-shot performance on the challenging coMplex video Object SEgmentation v2
(MOSEv2) dataset. Without any fine-tuning on the training set, SeC achieved
39.7 \JFn on the test set and ranked 2nd place in the Complex VOS track of the
7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge.

### [509] [Towards Fine-Grained Text-to-3D Quality Assessment: A Benchmark and A Two-Stage Rank-Learning Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23841)
*Bingyang Cui,Yujie Zhang,Qi Yang,Zhu Li,Yiling Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Advances in Text-to-3D (T23D) generation face challenges in creating reliable quality assessment. This paper introduces the T23D-CompBench benchmark and the Rank2Score evaluator to improve reliability and alignment with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T23D quality assessment methods suffer from outdated benchmarks, fragmented approaches, and design limitations leading to poor metric robustness and weak alignment with human perception.

Method: The authors introduce T23D-CompBench, a benchmark with well-defined components and subcomponents, conducting large-scale human evaluations. They also propose Rank2Score, a two-stage training evaluator using supervised contrastive regression and curriculum learning for alignment with human ratings.

Result: Rank2Score demonstrates superior performance in predictive accuracy, robustness, and alignment with human judgments when compared to existing metrics. It also provides utility as a reward function for generative model optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and metric significantly enhance the evaluation quality of T23D assets, contributing to more reliable and representative assessments for generative models.

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-3D (T23D) generative models have enabled the
synthesis of diverse, high-fidelity 3D assets from textual prompts. However,
existing challenges restrict the development of reliable T23D quality
assessment (T23DQA). First, existing benchmarks are outdated, fragmented, and
coarse-grained, making fine-grained metric training infeasible. Moreover,
current objective metrics exhibit inherent design limitations, resulting in
non-representative feature extraction and diminished metric robustness. To
address these limitations, we introduce T23D-CompBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for compositional T23D generation. We define five components with
twelve sub-components for compositional prompts, which are used to generate
3,600 textured meshes from ten state-of-the-art generative models. A
large-scale subjective experiment is conducted to collect 129,600 reliable
human ratings across different perspectives. Based on T23D-CompBench, we
further propose Rank2Score, an effective evaluator with two-stage training for
T23DQA. Rank2Score enhances pairwise training via supervised contrastive
regression and curriculum learning in the first stage, and subsequently refines
predictions using mean opinion scores to achieve closer alignment with human
judgments in the second stage. Extensive experiments and downstream
applications demonstrate that Rank2Score consistently outperforms existing
metrics across multiple dimensions and can additionally serve as a reward
function to optimize generative models. The project is available at

*Michihiro Kuroki,Toshihiko Yamasaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CE-FAM, a new method for concept-based AI explanations, integrating activation maps and Vision and Language Models to identify, interpret, and evaluate concept regions in AI predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing saliency maps and concept-based explanations, which either rely on user interpretation or fail to simultaneously identify learned concepts, their locations, and prediction contributions.

Method: Proposed the CE-FAM framework using a branched network to merge activation maps with embeddings of a Vision and Language Model, enabling identification of concept regions and their contributions, without annotated datasets.

Result: Developed a novel evaluation metric, demonstrated superior performance in comparison to existing approaches, and achieved robust zero-shot inference capabilities for unseen concepts.

Conclusion: CE-FAM successfully enhances AI explainability by linking image regions to human-understandable concepts and demonstrating their prediction contributions, setting a new benchmark in concept-based explanations.

Abstract: Although saliency maps can highlight important regions to explain the
reasoning behind image classification in artificial intelligence (AI), the
meaning of these regions is left to the user's interpretation. In contrast,
conceptbased explanations decompose AI predictions into humanunderstandable
concepts, clarifying their contributions. However, few methods can
simultaneously reveal what concepts an image classifier learns, which regions
are associated with them, and how they contribute to predictions. We propose a
novel concept-based explanation method, Concept-based Explanation via Fusion of
Activation Maps (CE-FAM). It employs a branched network that shares activation
maps with an image classifier and learns to mimic the embeddings of a Vision
and Language Model (VLM). The branch network predicts concepts in an image, and
their corresponding regions are represented by a weighted sum of activation
maps, with weights given by the gradients of the concept prediction scores.
Their contributions are quantified based on their impact on the image
classification score. Our method provides a general framework for identifying
the concept regions and their contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge to
handle arbitrary concepts without requiring an annotated dataset. Furthermore,
we introduce a novel evaluation metric to assess the accuracy of the concept
regions. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate our method
outperforms existing approaches and excels in zero-shot inference for unseen
concepts.

*Djamel Eddine Boukhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FairViT-GAN, a hybrid framework combining CNNs and ViTs to predict facial beauty while reducing inherent biases and enhancing fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in existing Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) models, such as architectural constraints, demographic biases, and lack of interpretability.

Method: The method utilizes a hybrid framework combining a CNN branch for local features, a ViT branch for global context, and an adversarial debiasing mechanism to mitigate biases related to protected attributes.

Result: FairViT-GAN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with a Pearson Correlation of 0.9230 and RMSE of 0.2650, while reducing ethnic subgroup bias performance gaps by 82.9% and showing fairer outcomes.

Conclusion: FairViT-GAN provides a fair, transparent, and accurate framework that advances AI systems' capability in facial beauty prediction while mitigating algorithmic biases.

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) has made significant strides with the
application of deep learning, yet state-of-the-art models often exhibit
critical limitations, including architectural constraints, inherent demographic
biases, and a lack of transparency. Existing methods, primarily based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), excel at capturing local texture but
struggle with global facial harmony, while Vision Transformers (ViTs)
effectively model long-range dependencies but can miss fine-grained details.
Furthermore, models trained on benchmark datasets can inadvertently learn and
perpetuate societal biases related to protected attributes like ethnicity. To
address these interconnected challenges, we propose \textbf{FairViT-GAN}, a
novel hybrid framework that synergistically integrates a CNN branch for local
feature extraction and a ViT branch for global context modeling. More
significantly, we introduce an adversarial debiasing mechanism where the
feature extractor is explicitly trained to produce representations that are
invariant to protected attributes, thereby actively mitigating algorithmic
bias. Our framework's transparency is enhanced by visualizing the distinct
focus of each architectural branch. Extensive experiments on the SCUT-FBP5500
benchmark demonstrate that FairViT-GAN not only sets a new state-of-the-art in
predictive accuracy, achieving a Pearson Correlation of \textbf{0.9230} and
reducing RMSE to \textbf{0.2650}, but also excels in fairness. Our analysis
reveals a remarkable \textbf{82.9\% reduction in the performance gap} between
ethnic subgroups, with the adversary's classification accuracy dropping to
near-random chance (52.1\%). We believe FairViT-GAN provides a robust,
transparent, and significantly fairer blueprint for developing responsible AI
systems for subjective visual assessment.

*Jiajin Tang,Zhengxuan Wei,Yuchen Zhu,Cheng Shi,Guanbin Li,Liang Lin,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sim-DETR, a modified version of DETR, with enhancements targeting issues in temporal sentence grounding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges and inefficiencies in applying DETR-based strategies to the task of grounding sentences to precise moments in videos, focusing on query conflicts and semantic localization issues.

Method: Sim-DETR incorporates two key modifications in the DETR decoder layers: limiting queries based on semantic and positional overlap, and integrating query-to-frame alignment for better global-local context bridging.

Result: Sim-DETR is experimentally shown to outperform standard DETR, successfully leveraging its strengths for temporal sentence grounding.

Conclusion: Sim-DETR serves as a strong foundational model for future studies in video-to-sentence alignment tasks, rectifying critical DETR shortcomings.

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding aims to identify exact moments in a video that
correspond to a given textual query, typically addressed with detection
transformer (DETR) solutions. However, we find that typical strategies designed
to enhance DETR do not improve, and may even degrade, its performance in this
task. We systematically analyze and identify the root causes of this abnormal
behavior: (1) conflicts between queries from similar target moments and (2)
internal query conflicts due to the tension between global semantics and local
localization. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet powerful
baseline, Sim-DETR, which extends the standard DETR with two minor
modifications in the decoder layers: (1) constraining self-attention between
queries based on their semantic and positional overlap and (2) adding
query-to-frame alignment to bridge the global and local contexts. Experiments
demonstrate that Sim-DETR unlocks the full potential of DETR for temporal
sentence grounding, offering a strong baseline for future research.

*Ky Dan Nguyen,Hoang Lam Tran,Anh-Dung Dinh,Daochang Liu,Weidong Cai,Xiuying Wang,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG) to address inconsistencies in autoregressive image generation caused by progressive resolution scaling, ensuring coherent and semantically faithful images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive image generation methods struggle with information inconsistencies between patches during scaling, leading to ambiguous and unfaithful features.

Method: The authors propose IGG, which uses attention mechanisms to ground informative patches, ensuring alignment between guidance signals and conditioning information during sampling.

Result: IGG significantly improves the sharpness, coherence, and semantic grounding of images in both class-conditioned and text-to-image generation tasks.

Conclusion: IGG establishes a new standard for autoregressive image generation methods by resolving challenges with information consistency and enhancing image quality.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models based on next-scale prediction are rapidly
emerging as a powerful tool for image generation, but they face a critical
weakness: information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps
introduced by progressive resolution scaling. These inconsistencies scatter
guidance signals, causing them to drift away from conditioning information and
leaving behind ambiguous, unfaithful features. We tackle this challenge with
Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG), a novel mechanism that anchors guidance
to semantically important regions through attention. By adaptively reinforcing
informative patches during sampling, IGG ensures that guidance and content
remain tightly aligned. Across both class-conditioned and text-to-image
generation tasks, IGG delivers sharper, more coherent, and semantically
grounded images, setting a new benchmark for AR-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of metrics quantifying robustness of MLLMs against irrelevant visual context in real-world applications.

Method: PCRI systematically quantifies changes in model performance between localized image patches vs. full-image input across 15 benchmarks.

Result: Most models remain sensitive to background noise; only a few like InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B show robustness consistently.

Conclusion: PCRI provides diagnostic insights for researchers, aiding principled model selection and guiding development for real-world robust MLLMs.

Abstract: The reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world
settings is often undermined by sensitivity to irrelevant or distracting visual
context, an aspect not captured by existing evaluation metrics. We introduce
the \textbf{Patch Context Robustness Index (PCRI)}, the first systematic and
interpretable score for quantifying MLLM robustness to variations in visual
context granularity, measuring performance changes between localized image
patches and full-image input.
  Applying PCRI to 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs across 15 vision-language
benchmarks, we find that most leading models remain brittle to background
noise, with only a few, such as InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B, demonstrating
consistent robustness across tasks. PCRI analysis also highlights how different
model architectures handle and integrate visual context, offering actionable
diagnostic insight for both researchers and practitioners.
  PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness, supporting principled
model selection and guiding the development of future architectures and
training strategies for robust, real-world deployment.

*Taehun Kong,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework for semi-supervised 3D object detection that utilizes a learnable pseudo-labeling module to enhance pseudo-label quality and improve detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of manual thresholding and limited contextual understanding in pseudo-label-based teacher-student frameworks for SS3DOD.

Method: The framework employs a learnable pseudo-labeling module with two networks to assess pseudo-label quality using score fusion and context-adaptive thresholds, supervised by ground truth alignment. Additionally, a soft supervision strategy manages pseudo-label noise.

Result: Experiments on KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate that the method selects high-precision pseudo-labels, achieving wider contextual coverage, higher recall, and improved performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive pseudo-labeling and noise-robust learning strategies significantly enhance the effectiveness of semi-supervised 3D object detection frameworks.

Abstract: Semi-supervised 3D object detection (SS3DOD) aims to reduce costly 3D
annotations utilizing unlabeled data. Recent studies adopt pseudo-label-based
teacher-student frameworks and demonstrate impressive performance. The main
challenge of these frameworks is in selecting high-quality pseudo-labels from
the teacher's predictions. Most previous methods, however, select pseudo-labels
by comparing confidence scores over thresholds manually set. The latest works
tackle the challenge either by dynamic thresholding or refining the quality of
pseudo-labels. Such methods still overlook contextual information e.g. object
distances, classes, and learning states, and inadequately assess the
pseudo-label quality using partial information available from the networks. In
this work, we propose a novel SS3DOD framework featuring a learnable
pseudo-labeling module designed to automatically and adaptively select
high-quality pseudo-labels. Our approach introduces two networks at the teacher
output level. These networks reliably assess the quality of pseudo-labels by
the score fusion and determine context-adaptive thresholds, which are
supervised by the alignment of pseudo-labels over GT bounding boxes.
Additionally, we introduce a soft supervision strategy that can learn robustly
under pseudo-label noises. This helps the student network prioritize cleaner
labels over noisy ones in semi-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on
the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The
proposed method selects high-precision pseudo-labels while maintaining a wider
coverage of contexts and a higher recall rate, significantly improving relevant
SS3DOD methods.

*Guoquan Wei,Zekun Zhou,Liu Shi,Wenzhe Shan,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents SuperDiff, a self-supervised diffusion-based method for denoising low-dose CT scans, achieving superior reconstruction and generalization using only LDCT data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for low-dose CT denoising depend heavily on paired data and show poor generalization, particularly under varying or unseen dose conditions.

Method: SuperDiff employs a contextual subdata similarity sensing strategy for initial priors, combines knowledge distillation with latent diffusion models for detail optimization, and introduces pixel-level self-correcting fusion for fine-grained reconstruction.

Result: SuperDiff demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple datasets and real data.

Conclusion: SuperDiff provides a robust, flexible framework for LDCT denoising, enabling scalability across doses without requiring clean data, making it practical for clinical applications.

Abstract: Current models based on deep learning for low-dose CT denoising rely heavily
on paired data and generalize poorly. Even the more concerned diffusion models
need to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is
difficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications. At the same time,
self-supervised-based methods face the challenge of significant degradation of
generalizability of models pre-trained for the current dose to expand to other
doses. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method of
tunable-generalization diffusion powered by self-supervised contextual sub-data
for low-dose CT reconstruction, named SuperDiff. Firstly, a contextual subdata
similarity adaptive sensing strategy is designed for denoising centered on the
LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent
progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge
distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing
image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and
the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained
reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the
initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is
flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen
doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising,
SuperDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing.
Full qualitative and quantitative evaluations on both datasets and real data
show that SuperDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in terms of reconstruction and generalization performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AssemblyHands-X, a markerless 3D hand-body benchmark to evaluate hand-body coordination in bimanual activities for action recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of datasets enabling systematic evaluation of hand-body coordination in understanding bimanual human activities.

Method: A pipeline for 3D pose annotation from multi-view videos combining multi-view triangulation and SMPL-X mesh fitting was developed. Action recognition models were tested on various input representations to study hand-body coordination.

Result: The study found that pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate compared to video data. Joint modeling of hands and body significantly enhanced action recognition accuracy.

Conclusion: Understanding interdependent dynamics of hand and body is crucial for improving action recognition models.

Abstract: Bimanual human activities inherently involve coordinated movements of both
hands and body. However, the impact of this coordination in activity
understanding has not been systematically evaluated due to the lack of suitable
datasets. Such evaluation demands kinematic-level annotations (e.g., 3D pose)
for the hands and body, yet existing 3D activity datasets typically annotate
either hand or body pose. Another line of work employs marker-based motion
capture to provide full-body pose, but the physical markers introduce visual
artifacts, thereby limiting models' generalization to natural, markerless
videos. To address these limitations, we present AssemblyHands-X, the first
markerless 3D hand-body benchmark for bimanual activities, designed to study
the effect of hand-body coordination for action recognition. We begin by
constructing a pipeline for 3D pose annotation from synchronized multi-view
videos. Our approach combines multi-view triangulation with SMPL-X mesh
fitting, yielding reliable 3D registration of hands and upper body. We then
validate different input representations (e.g., video, hand pose, body pose, or
hand-body pose) across recent action recognition models based on graph
convolution or spatio-temporal attention. Our extensive experiments show that
pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate than video
baselines. Moreover, joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action
recognition over using hands or upper body alone, highlighting the importance
of modeling interdependent hand-body dynamics for a holistic understanding of
bimanual activities.

TL;DR: The paper addresses privacy leakage in multimodal systems using machine unlearning, proposing a Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning (CCU) framework to improve performance during visual unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for machine unlearning fail to retain cross-modal knowledge and maintain structural integrity of retained data, leading to compromised performance.

Method: The CCU framework integrates selective visual unlearning via inverse contrastive learning, cross-modal knowledge retention through semantic consistency, and dual-set contrastive separation for structural stabilization.

Result: CCU demonstrated a 7.12% accuracy improvement and achieved fast unlearning processing with only 7% of the unlearning time compared to the best existing method.

Conclusion: The proposed CCU framework effectively addresses privacy leakage in visual modality while maintaining cross-modal performance and structural stability, showcasing significant efficiency and accuracy improvements.

Abstract: Visual modality is the most vulnerable to privacy leakage in real-world
multimodal applications like autonomous driving with visual and radar data;
Machine unlearning removes specific training data from pre-trained models to
address privacy leakage, however, existing methods fail to preserve cross-modal
knowledge and maintain intra-class structural stability of retain data, leading
to reduced overall and other modalities' performance during visual unlearning;
to address these challenges, we propose a Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning
(CCU) framework, which integrates three key components: (a) selective visual
unlearning: employing inverse contrastive learning to dissociate visual
representations from their original semantics, (b) cross-modal knowledge
retention: preserving other modalities' discriminability through semantic
consistency, and (c) dual-set contrastive separation: preserving the model
performance via isolation of structural perturbations between the unlearn set
and retain set; extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the
superiority of CCU, and our method achieves a 7.12% accuracy improvement with
only 7% of the unlearning time compared to the top-accuracy baseline.

*Rakesh Thakur,Yusra Tariq,Rakesh Chandra Joshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Q-FSRU, a model combining Frequency Spectrum Representation and Fusion with Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation for improved medical Visual Question Answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in healthcare AI related to the complex intersection of image and text-based reasoning in medical decision-making.

Method: Q-FSRU uses Fast Fourier Transform to analyze frequency domain features of medical images and text, combined with quantum-inspired retrieval of external medical knowledge for enhanced reasoning.

Result: The model, tested on the VQA-RAD dataset, outperformed previous approaches, especially in complex scenarios requiring both image and text understanding.

Conclusion: Q-FSRU presents a promising, interpretable AI framework to improve medical VQA, enhancing decision support for healthcare professionals.

Abstract: Solving tough clinical questions that require both image and text
understanding is still a major challenge in healthcare AI. In this work, we
propose Q-FSRU, a new model that combines Frequency Spectrum Representation and
Fusion (FSRU) with a method called Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(Quantum RAG) for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). The model takes in
features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the
frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on
more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To
improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a
quantum inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from
external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are
then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We
evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology
images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier
models, especially on complex cases needing image text reasoning. The mix of
frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability.
Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and
helpful AI tools for doctors.

*Anoushka Harit,William Prew,Zhongtian Sun,Florian Markowetz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework combining class-conditional diffusion replay and Elastic Weight Consolidation for privacy-preserving continual learning in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning for medical imaging models is essential, but challenges arise due to privacy concerns and computational costs related to full retraining.

Method: The authors combine class-conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation, using a Vision Transformer backbone, to enable continual learning while avoiding patient exemplar storage.

Result: On medical datasets, the framework achieves strong performance (e.g., 0.851 AUROC on CheXpert), reduces forgetting by over 30% relative to DER++, and approaches joint training performance efficiently.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates an effective and scalable solution for privacy-conscious continual learning in clinical imaging, supported by detailed analysis of forgetting factors.

Abstract: Medical imaging foundation models must adapt over time, yet full retraining
is often blocked by privacy constraints and cost. We present a continual
learning framework that avoids storing patient exemplars by pairing class
conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation. Using a compact
Vision Transformer backbone, we evaluate across eight MedMNIST v2 tasks and
CheXpert. On CheXpert our approach attains 0.851 AUROC, reduces forgetting by
more than 30\% relative to DER\texttt{++}, and approaches joint training at
0.869 AUROC, while remaining efficient and privacy preserving. Analyses connect
forgetting to two measurable factors: fidelity of replay and Fisher weighted
parameter drift, highlighting the complementary roles of replay diffusion and
synaptic stability. The results indicate a practical route for scalable,
privacy aware continual adaptation of clinical imaging models.

*You Zhou,Lijiang Chen,Shuchang Lyu,Guangxia Cui,Wenpei Bai,Zheng Zhou,Meng Li,Guangliang Cheng,Huiyu Zhou,Qi Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Federated Domain Adaptation (FedDA) for cross-domain medical image segmentation, addressing challenges in federated learning from heterogeneous medical image modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the study is to tackle the challenges posed by heterogeneous medical image data in federated learning (FL) setups, particularly addressing cross-domain medical image segmentation where clients have different modalities due to data imbalance, corruption, or preservation practices.

Method: The proposed method involves a feature-level adversarial learning framework, where feature maps across clients are aligned using adversarial training to enhance model generalization and combat the negative effects of domain-shift.

Result: Experiments on three medical image datasets demonstrate that FedDA improves cross-domain performance and endows a single-modality client with processing capabilities for other modalities, outperforming state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the FedDA framework is effective in addressing domain-shift challenges in federated learning for medical images, achieving robust cross-domain performance and enabling more versatile segmentation capabilities for single-modality clients.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models
among different clients while ensuring data privacy, emerging as the mainstream
for breaking data silos in the healthcare domain. However, the imbalance of
medical resources, data corruption or improper data preservation may lead to a
situation where different clients possess medical images of different modality.
This heterogeneity poses a significant challenge for cross-domain medical image
segmentation within the federated learning framework. To address this
challenge, we propose a new Federated Domain Adaptation (FedDA) segmentation
training framework. Specifically, we propose a feature-level adversarial
learning among clients by aligning feature maps across clients through
embedding an adversarial training mechanism. This design can enhance the
model's generalization on multiple domains and alleviate the negative impact
from domain-shift. Comprehensive experiments on three medical image datasets
demonstrate that our proposed FedDA substantially achieves cross-domain
federated aggregation, endowing single modality client with cross-modality
processing capabilities, and consistently delivers robust performance compared
to state-of-the-art federated aggregation algorithms in objective and
subjective assessment. Our code are available at

*Xin Luo,Jiahao Wang,Chenyuan Wu,Shitao Xiao,Xiyan Jiang,Defu Lian,Jiajun Zhang,Dong Liu,Zheng liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a methodology for reinforcement learning-based image editing, focusing on developing a specialized reward model to overcome challenges in training signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image editing models struggle with complex instructions and often need multiple attempts to produce accurate results due to the lack of effective reward signals.

Method: It introduces EditReward-Bench for benchmarking, develops EditScore as a high-fidelity reward model series, and uses data curation and self-ensemble strategies for improved effectiveness. This reward model is integrated into online RL for image editing.

Result: The largest EditScore model surpasses GPT-5 on the benchmark, and integrating it with the OmniGen2 base model offers significant performance improvements in image editing tasks.

Conclusion: A domain-specialized reward model like EditScore is essential for enabling effective RL in image editing, providing a systematic approach to training and optimization.

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing has achieved remarkable progress, yet
current models still face challenges with complex instructions and often
require multiple samples to produce a desired result. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) offers a promising solution, but its adoption in image editing has been
severely hindered by the lack of a high-fidelity, efficient reward signal. In
this work, we present a comprehensive methodology to overcome this barrier,
centered on the development of a state-of-the-art, specialized reward model. We
first introduce EditReward-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically
evaluate reward models on editing quality. Building on this benchmark, we
develop EditScore, a series of reward models (7B-72B) for evaluating the
quality of instruction-guided image editing. Through meticulous data curation
and filtering, EditScore effectively matches the performance of learning
proprietary VLMs. Furthermore, coupled with an effective self-ensemble strategy
tailored for the generative nature of EditScore, our largest variant even
surpasses GPT-5 in the benchmark. We then demonstrate that a high-fidelity
reward model is the key to unlocking online RL for image editing. Our
experiments show that, while even the largest open-source VLMs fail to provide
an effective learning signal, EditScore enables efficient and robust policy
optimization. Applying our framework to a strong base model, OmniGen2, results
in a final model that shows a substantial and consistent performance uplift.
Overall, this work provides the first systematic path from benchmarking to
reward modeling to RL training in image editing, showing that a high-fidelity,
domain-specialized reward model is the key to unlocking the full potential of
RL in this domain.

*Xiyan Xu,Sirui Xu,Yu-Xiong Wang,Liang-Yan Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes MoReact, a diffusion-based model for generating semantically accurate and realistic human reactions using text descriptions and counterpart motion as guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of existing models that either treat individuals as a single entity, rely solely on one person's motion to predict reactions, or fail to incorporate rich semantic context in human interactions.

Method: MoReact addresses the problem by first generating global trajectories and subsequently generating local motion for precise alignment with the described interaction. The method uses a novel interaction loss to enhance realism in close interactions.

Result: The experiments, conducted on a two-person motion dataset, demonstrate MoReact's capability to generate realistic, diverse, and controllable motion reactions aligned with both textual and motion-based input.

Conclusion: MoReact pushes the boundaries in human reaction generation by combining diffusion mechanisms with semantic and motion-based alignment, offering practical applications in computer vision and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Modeling and generating human reactions poses a significant challenge with
broad applications for computer vision and human-computer interaction. Existing
methods either treat multiple individuals as a single entity, directly
generating interactions, or rely solely on one person's motion to generate the
other's reaction, failing to integrate the rich semantic information that
underpins human interactions. Yet, these methods often fall short in adaptive
responsiveness, i.e., the ability to accurately respond to diverse and dynamic
interaction scenarios. Recognizing this gap, our work introduces an approach
tailored to address the limitations of existing models by focusing on
text-driven human reaction generation. Our model specifically generates
realistic motion sequences for individuals that responding to the other's
actions based on a descriptive text of the interaction scenario. The goal is to
produce motion sequences that not only complement the opponent's movements but
also semantically fit the described interactions. To achieve this, we present
MoReact, a diffusion-based method designed to disentangle the generation of
global trajectories and local motions sequentially. This approach stems from
the observation that generating global trajectories first is crucial for
guiding local motion, ensuring better alignment with given action and text.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel interaction loss to enhance the realism of
generated close interactions. Our experiments, utilizing data adapted from a
two-person motion dataset, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for this
novel task, which is capable of producing realistic, diverse, and controllable
reactions that not only closely match the movements of the counterpart but also
adhere to the textual guidance. Please find our webpage at

*Yihang Guo,Tianyuan Yu,Liang Bai,Yanming Guo,Yirun Ruan,William Li,Weishi Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper highlights optimization imbalance in multi-task learning (MTL) and shows that scaling task losses based on gradient norms can effectively improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and resolve the persistent issue of unbalanced optimization in MTL that hinders its full potential.

Method: A systematic analysis identifying factors like gradient norms contributing to optimization imbalance, and proposing loss scaling based on these norms.

Result: Scaling task losses by gradient norms achieves results comparable to complex, computationally expensive methods such as grid searches.

Conclusion: Optimization imbalance in MTL can be better addressed by managing gradient dynamics rather than relying on intricate strategies, making the process more efficient.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to build general-purpose vision systems by
training a single network to perform multiple tasks jointly. While promising,
its potential is often hindered by "unbalanced optimization", where task
interference leads to subpar performance compared to single-task models. To
facilitate research in MTL, this paper presents a systematic experimental
analysis to dissect the factors contributing to this persistent problem. Our
investigation confirms that the performance of existing optimization methods
varies inconsistently across datasets, and advanced architectures still rely on
costly grid-searched loss weights. Furthermore, we show that while powerful
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) provide strong initialization, they do not
inherently resolve the optimization imbalance, and merely increasing data
quantity offers limited benefits. A crucial finding emerges from our analysis:
a strong correlation exists between the optimization imbalance and the norm of
task-specific gradients. We demonstrate that this insight is directly
applicable, showing that a straightforward strategy of scaling task losses
according to their gradient norms can achieve performance comparable to that of
an extensive and computationally expensive grid search. Our comprehensive
analysis suggests that understanding and controlling gradient dynamics is a
more direct path to stable MTL than developing increasingly complex methods.

### [527] [Bridging the Task Gap: Multi-Task Adversarial Transferability in CLIP and Its Derivatives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23917)
*Kuanrong Liu,Siyuan Liang,Cheng Qian,Ming Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines CLIP's robustness under adversarial attacks, proposing MT-AdvCLIP to enhance cross-task adversarial generalization. Experiments show a 39% improvement in multi-task attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP, a leading vision-language model, struggles with fine-grained tasks and untested robustness to adversarial perturbations. Understanding this robustness is critical for assessing security risks.

Method: The authors conduct empirical analysis on CLIP-based models under multi-task adversarial settings and propose MT-AdvCLIP, which utilizes task-aware feature aggregation loss to enhance adversarial example transferability across tasks.

Result: MT-AdvCLIP achieved a significant improvement, with attack success rates increased by over 39% on multiple CLIP-derived models while staying within the same perturbation budget.

Conclusion: This work advances understanding of adversarial robustness in multi-task CLIP models and offers a framework to enhance attack effectiveness, highlighting the importance of multi-task robustness evaluation.

Abstract: As a general-purpose vision-language pretraining model, CLIP demonstrates
strong generalization ability in image-text alignment tasks and has been widely
adopted in downstream applications such as image classification and image-text
retrieval. However, it struggles with fine-grained tasks such as object
detection and semantic segmentation. While many variants aim to improve CLIP on
these tasks, its robustness to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored.
Understanding how adversarial examples transfer across tasks is key to
assessing CLIP's generalization limits and security risks. In this work, we
conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the cross-task transfer behavior of
CLIP-based models on image-text retrieval, object detection, and semantic
segmentation under adversarial perturbations. We find that adversarial examples
generated from fine-grained tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic
segmentation) often exhibit stronger transfer potential than those from
coarse-grained tasks, enabling more effective attacks against the original CLIP
model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Task
Adversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP), which introduces a task-aware feature
aggregation loss and generates perturbations with enhanced cross-task
generalization capability. This design strengthens the attack effectiveness of
fine-grained task models on the shared CLIP backbone. Experimental results on
multiple public datasets show that MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves the
adversarial transfer success rate (The average attack success rate across
multiple tasks is improved by over 39%.) against various CLIP-derived models,
without increasing the perturbation budget. This study reveals the transfer
mechanism of adversarial examples in multi-task CLIP models, offering new
insights into multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design.

*Longtao Jiang,Mingfei Han,Lei Chen,Yongqiang Yu,Feng Zhao,Xiaojun Chang,Zhihui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a training-free text-guided image inpainting method, Token Painter, using Mask AutoRegressive (MAR) models to improve local controllability and harmony between prompts and backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods struggle with aligning inpainting results to prompts and maintaining consistent backgrounds due to latent modeling of the entire image.

Method: The method includes Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF) for semantic-context integration in the frequency domain and Adaptive Decoder Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE) for improving attention on guidance/inpainting tokens.

Result: Token Painter delivers better alignment to text prompts, harmonious background integration, and superior visual quality compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method overcomes key limitations of diffusion-based approaches, offering a novel and effective approach to text-guided image inpainting with high performance metrics.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims to inpaint masked image regions based on a
textual prompt while preserving the background. Although diffusion-based
methods have become dominant, their property of modeling the entire image in
latent space makes it challenging for the results to align well with prompt
details and maintain a consistent background. To address these issues, we
explore Mask AutoRegressive (MAR) models for this task. MAR naturally supports
image inpainting by generating latent tokens corresponding to mask regions,
enabling better local controllability without altering the background. However,
directly applying MAR to this task makes the inpainting content either ignore
the prompts or be disharmonious with the background context. Through analysis
of the attention maps from the inpainting images, we identify the impact of
background tokens on text tokens during the MAR generation, and leverage this
to design \textbf{Token Painter}, a training-free text-guided image inpainting
method based on MAR. Our approach introduces two key components: (1)
Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF), which fuses the semantic and
context information from text and background in frequency domain to produce
novel guidance tokens, allowing MAR to generate text-faithful inpainting
content while keeping harmonious with background context. (2) Adaptive Decoder
Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE), which adaptively enhances attention scores on
guidance tokens and inpainting tokens to further enhance the alignment of
prompt details and the content visual quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our training-free method outperforms prior state-of-the-art
methods across almost all metrics and delivers superior visual results. Codes
will be released.

*Alexandros Doumanoglou,Kurt Driessens,Dimitrios Zarpalas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores how deep vision networks represent concepts as directional vectors in latent space and proposes methods to uncover these directional pairs to improve model interpretability and debugging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to make deep neural networks more interpretable by uncovering how concepts are embedded and represented within the latent space and how these directions affect predictions.

Method: The proposed approach identifies decoding directions through directional clustering of activations and estimates encoding directions using probabilistic signal vector analysis. Additionally, it introduces the Uncertainty Region Alignment technique to interpret directional effects on model predictions.

Result: The method successfully recovers ground-truth direction pairs in synthetic data, maps to interpretable concepts better than unsupervised baselines in real data, and estimates encoding directions through signal vectors validated by activation maximization.

Conclusion: This work significantly enhances the interpretability, debugging, and correction of deep vision networks by uncovering directional encoding-decoding patterns and provides multiple applications from model behavior analysis to error correction.

Abstract: Empirical evidence shows that deep vision networks represent concepts as
directions in latent space, vectors we call concept embeddings. Each concept
has a latent factor-a scalar-indicating its presence in an input patch. For a
given patch, multiple latent factors are encoded into a compact representation
by linearly combining concept embeddings, with the factors as coefficients.
Since these embeddings enable such encoding, we call them encoding directions.
A latent factor can be recovered via the inner product with a filter, a vector
we call a decoding direction. These encoding-decoding direction pairs are not
directly accessible, but recovering them helps open the black box of deep
networks, enabling understanding, debugging, and improving models. Decoder
directions attribute meaning to latent codes, while encoding directions assess
concept influence on predictions, with both enabling model correction by
unlearning irrelevant concepts. Unlike prior matrix decomposition, autoencoder,
or dictionary learning methods that rely on feature reconstruction, we propose
a new perspective: decoding directions are identified via directional
clustering of activations, and encoding directions are estimated with signal
vectors under a probabilistic view. We further leverage network weights through
a novel technique, Uncertainty Region Alignment, which reveals interpretable
directions affecting predictions. Our analysis shows that (a) on synthetic
data, our method recovers ground-truth direction pairs; (b) on real data,
decoding directions map to monosemantic, interpretable concepts and outperform
unsupervised baselines; and (c) signal vectors faithfully estimate encoding
directions, validated via activation maximization. Finally, we demonstrate
applications in understanding global model behavior, explaining individual
predictions, and intervening to produce counterfactuals or correct errors.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAR-KnowLIP, the first multimodal foundational model tailored for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, addressing a major research gap in cross-modal AI for remote sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the lack of foundational models for SAR imagery, which is vital for all-weather and all-day remote sensing applications but has largely been overlooked in favor of RGB imagery.

Method: The paper creates SAR-GEOVL-1M, a massive SAR dataset with unique geographic information, employs a hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT) for semantic annotation generation, implements a Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization learning mechanism, and provides a unified evaluation benchmark across various remote sensing tasks.

Result: SAR-KnowLIP achieves superior performance in tasks like object counting and land-cover classification, outperforming 14 leading foundation models across 11 downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The introduction of SAR-KnowLIP, along with its dataset, model, and evaluation frameworks, is expected to significantly boost research in SAR multimodal foundational models, bridging gaps in remote sensing AI.

Abstract: Cross-modal artificial intelligence has garnered widespread attention in
recent years, achieving significant progress in the study of natural images.
However, existing methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a
significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. SAR, with
its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, plays an irreplaceable role in
remote sensing scene understanding. To address this gap, this paper proposes
SAR-KnowLIP, the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model, along with
reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) This work introduces
the critical yet long-overlooked attribute of geographic information into
remote sensing research, constructing SAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR
dataset with complete geographic projection properties), covering multiple
satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities. (2) Aligned structured
text is generated through a hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT),
providing more than one million multi-dimensional semantic annotations of
landforms, regional functions, target attributes, and spatial relationships.
(3) We design a Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism that
continuously enhances cross-modal alignment through a self-supervised closed
loop of contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning on a transferable
multimodal encoder. (4) A unified evaluation benchmark is established across 11
representative downstream vision and vision-language tasks, with comparisons
against 14 leading foundation models, where SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading
performance, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification. We
expect that SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model
architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly
advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.

*Hanshi Wang,Yuhao Xu,Zekun Xu,Jin Gao,Yufan Liu,Weiming Hu,Ke Wang,Zhipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoPrune, a training-free framework for adaptively pruning visual tokens in large vision-language models, achieving significant computational reduction while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce computational overhead in vision-language models by addressing limitations of fixed or heuristic pruning strategies.

Method: Introduces AutoPrune, which dynamically adjusts pruning policies using mutual information between tokens and a budget-constrained logistic retention curve, tailoring to input complexity.

Result: AutoPrune demonstrated substantial computational savings (89% pruning, 76.8% reduction in FLOPs) while retaining 96.7% model accuracy, outperforming the previous method PDrop by 9.1%.

Conclusion: AutoPrune effectively balances computational constraints and task complexity by adaptively pruning visual tokens, making it suitable for diverse vision-language tasks, including autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: The established redundancy in visual tokens within large vision-language
models allows pruning to effectively reduce their substantial computational
demands. Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning
strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across
decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to
all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the
model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human
visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence
before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal
an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a
fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally
accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a
training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying
sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual
information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a
budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined
by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks
and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We
evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on
Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to
LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference
FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all
tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop,
demonstrating the effectiveness. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 3D-based automatic car damage detection pipeline that uplifts 2D masks and proposes a learning-free approach for 3D damage segmentation using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for car damage detection primarily rely on 2D image analysis, which limits their geometric accuracy and comprehensiveness. Leveraging 3D reconstruction methods can provide a more detailed and accurate representation of car damages.

Method: The paper proposes a single-view 3D-GS damage segmentation method where Gaussians are projected onto the image plane using camera parameters derived through Structure from Motion (SfM), filtered with Z-buffering and a depth normal distribution model.

Result: Experiments show that their learning-free 3D-GS segmentation is effective even in challenging scenarios, such as detecting small damages (e.g., scratches, dents) that are only visible in single views.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline and method enable accurate and comprehensive car damage detection using a 3D-based approach, overcoming limitations of traditional 2D and multi-view methods, with open-source code available for further exploration.

Abstract: Automatic car damage detection has been a topic of significant interest for
the auto insurance industry as it promises faster, accurate, and cost-effective
damage assessments. However, few works have gone beyond 2D image analysis to
leverage 3D reconstruction methods, which have the potential to provide a more
comprehensive and geometrically accurate representation of the damage.
Moreover, recent methods employing 3D representations for novel view synthesis,
particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), have demonstrated the ability to
generate accurate and coherent 3D reconstructions from a limited number of
views. In this work we introduce an automatic car damage detection pipeline
that performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. Additionally, we
propose a simple yet effective learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS
segmentation. Specifically, Gaussians are projected onto the image plane using
camera parameters obtained via Structure from Motion (SfM). They are then
filtered through an algorithm that utilizes Z-buffering along with a normal
distribution model of depth and opacities. Through experiments we found that
this method is particularly effective for challenging scenarios like car damage
detection, where target objects (e.g., scratches, small dents) may only be
clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches
impractical or impossible. The code is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents ColLab, an automated engine to produce REC and REG datasets without human supervision, leveraging multimodal models and spatial progression techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current REC and REG datasets rely on labor-intensive manual annotations, making scalability challenging.

Method: A Collaborative Multimodal Model Interaction (CMMI) strategy is used alongside Spatial Progressive Augmentation (SPA) to generate automated multimodal descriptions and enhance spatial detail.

Result: ColLab accelerates the annotation process while improving the quality and specificity of generated descriptions. It's also partially integrated into the ICCV 2025 MARS2 Challenge pipeline.

Conclusion: Fully automated frameworks like ColLab demonstrate significant progress in REC and REG data generation, showing promise for widespread adoption in multimodal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Generation
(REG) are fundamental tasks in multimodal understanding, supporting precise
object localization through natural language. However, existing REC and REG
datasets rely heavily on manual annotation, which is labor-intensive and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose ColLab, a collaborative spatial
progressive data engine that enables fully automated REC and REG data
generation without human supervision. Specifically, our method introduces a
Collaborative Multimodal Model Interaction (CMMI) strategy, which leverages the
semantic understanding of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large
language models (LLMs) to generate descriptions. Furthermore, we design a
module termed Spatial Progressive Augmentation (SPA) to enhance spatial
expressiveness among duplicate instances. Experiments demonstrate that ColLab
significantly accelerates the annotation process of REC and REG while improving
the quality and discriminability of the generated expressions. In addition to
the core methodological contribution, our framework was partially adopted in
the data generation pipeline of the ICCV 2025 MARS2 Challenge on Multimodal
Reasoning, enriching the dataset with diverse and challenging samples that
better reflect real-world reasoning demands.

*Yang Ye,Tianyu He,Shuo Yang,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RLIR, a post-training framework to improve action-following in video world models using objective reward signals derived from generated videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the suboptimal action-following capability of video world models, which has been under-explored despite advancements in visual quality and temporal consistency.

Method: RLIR uses an Inverse Dynamics Model to recover input actions from generated videos, producing verifiable rewards mapped to a low-dimensional action space for optimization via Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: RLIR achieves 5-10% improvements in action-following, up to 10% better visual quality, and higher human preference scores across various paradigms.

Conclusion: RLIR is established as the first post-training framework specifically designed to enhance action-following in video world models.

Abstract: World models simulate dynamic environments, enabling agents to interact with
diverse input modalities. Although recent advances have improved the visual
quality and temporal consistency of video world models, their ability of
accurately modeling human-specified actions remains under-explored.
Reinforcement learning presents a promising approach for directly improving the
suboptimal action-following capability of pre-trained models, assuming that an
appropriate reward function can be defined. However, transferring reinforcement
learning post-training methods to world model is impractical due to the
prohibitive cost of large-scale preference annotations and the infeasibility of
constructing rule-based video verifiers. To address this gap, we propose
Reinforcement Learning with Inverse Rewards (RLIR), a post-training framework
that derives verifiable reward signals by recovering input actions from
generated videos using an Inverse Dynamics Model. By mapping high-dimensional
video modality to a low-dimensional action space, RLIR provides an objective
and verifiable reward for optimization via Group Relative Policy Optimization.
Experiments across autoregressive and diffusion paradigms demonstrate 5-10%
gains in action-following, up to 10% improvements in visual quality, and higher
human preference scores, establishing RLIR as the first post-training method
specifically designed to enhance action-following in video world models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced machine learning method integrating CNN, wavelets, and chaos theory for thyroid cancer classification, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency on a large dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the global surge in thyroid cancer by providing timely and accurate diagnostic assistance through effective machine learning models.

Method: The proposed approach integrates Adaptive CNNs with CDF9/7 wavelet detail coefficients modulated by an n-scroll chaotic system. Performance is validated using a public thyroid ultrasound dataset and compared with state-of-the-art architectures.

Result: The method achieves 98.17% accuracy, exceeding competitive models like EfficientNetV2-S and ConvNeXt-T. It demonstrates computational efficiency and generalization, validated through cross-dataset testing and transfer to other medical imaging data.

Conclusion: The wavelet-chaos-CNN pipeline offers state-of-the-art performance for thyroid ultrasound classification, with strong potential for clinical integration due to accuracy, generalization, and real-time capabilities.

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial in addressing the global rise in
thyroid cancer, ensuring effective treatment strategies and improved patient
outcomes. We present an intelligent classification method that couples an
Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau
(CDF9/7) wavelets whose detail coefficients are modulated by an n-scroll
chaotic system to enrich discriminative features. We evaluate on the public
DDTI thyroid ultrasound dataset (n = 1,638 images; 819 malignant / 819 benign)
using 5-fold cross-validation, where the proposed method attains 98.17%
accuracy, 98.76% sensitivity, 97.58% specificity, 97.55% F1-score, and an AUC
of 0.9912. A controlled ablation shows that adding chaotic modulation to CDF9/7
improves accuracy by +8.79 percentage points over a CDF9/7-only CNN (from
89.38% to 98.17%). To objectively position our approach, we trained
state-of-the-art backbones on the same data and splits: EfficientNetV2-S
(96.58% accuracy; AUC 0.987), Swin-T (96.41%; 0.986), ViT-B/16 (95.72%; 0.983),
and ConvNeXt-T (96.94%; 0.987). Our method outperforms the best of these by
+1.23 points in accuracy and +0.0042 in AUC, while remaining computationally
efficient (28.7 ms per image; 1,125 MB peak VRAM). Robustness is further
supported by cross-dataset testing on TCIA (accuracy 95.82%) and transfer to an
ISIC skin-lesion subset (n = 28 unique images, augmented to 2,048; accuracy
97.31%). Explainability analyses (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME) highlight clinically
relevant regions. Altogether, the wavelet-chaos-CNN pipeline delivers
state-of-the-art thyroid ultrasound classification with strong generalization
and practical runtime characteristics suitable for clinical integration.

### [537] [VFSI: Validity First Spatial Intelligence for Constraint-Guided Traffic Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23971)
*Kargi Chauhan,Leilani H. Gilpin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion models like SceneDiffuser++ often produce traffic simulations violating physical constraints. Validity-First Spatial Intelligence (VFSI) addresses these issues by enforcing constraints during sampling, significantly improving simulation validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing traffic simulation models systematically generate trajectories that violate physical laws, undermining their realism and reliability.

Method: VFSI introduces energy-based guidance during diffusion sampling to enforce collision avoidance and kinematic constraints without retraining the base model.

Result: VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% and overall validity errors by 87%, while improving realism in generated trajectories.

Conclusion: Explicit constraint enforcement during inference is essential for achieving physically valid traffic simulations, and VFSI provides an effective model-agnostic solution.

Abstract: Modern diffusion models generate realistic traffic simulations but
systematically violate physical constraints. In a large-scale evaluation of
SceneDiffuser++, a state-of-the-art traffic simulator, we find that 50% of
generated trajectories violate basic physical laws - vehicles collide, drive
off roads, and spawn inside buildings. This reveals a fundamental limitation:
current models treat physical validity as an emergent property rather than an
architectural requirement. We propose Validity-First Spatial Intelligence
(VFSI), which enforces constraints through energy-based guidance during
diffusion sampling, without model retraining. By incorporating collision
avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, we guide the denoising
process toward physically valid trajectories. Across 200 urban scenarios from
the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% (24.6% to
8.1%) and improves overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while
simultaneously improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m). Our
model-agnostic approach demonstrates that explicit constraint enforcement
during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic
simulation.

### [538] [Towards Redundancy Reduction in Diffusion Models for Efficient Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23980)
*Jinpei Guo,Yifei Ji,Zheng Chen,Yufei Wang,Sizhuo Ma,Yong Guo,Yulun Zhang,Jian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents OASIS, an efficient diffusion model for video super-resolution (VSR) that introduces specialized attention routing and a progressive training strategy to address redundancy issues and improve performance, achieving state-of-the-art results with superior speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in applying generative diffusion models directly to VSR, as they introduce redundancy due to the low-quality videos already containing significant content information, which results in unnecessary computation and learning burdens.

Method: The method involves the development of OASIS, which introduces attention specialization routing to assign attention heads to different intrinsic patterns, effectively reducing redundancy. Additionally, a progressive training strategy is employed, beginning with consistent degradations and gradually shifting to inconsistent settings, improving the model's ability to handle complex degradations.

Result: OASIS achieves state-of-the-art VSR performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, with a significant inference speed advantage—a 6.2× speedup compared to other one-step diffusion models like SeedVR2.

Conclusion: OASIS is an efficient and robust one-step diffusion model for VSR that addresses redundancy issues, enhances adaptation to real-world scenarios, and provides superior performance and speed compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promising results for video
super-resolution (VSR). However, directly adapting generative diffusion models
to VSR can result in redundancy, since low-quality videos already preserve
substantial content information. Such redundancy leads to increased
computational overhead and learning burden, as the model performs superfluous
operations and must learn to filter out irrelevant information. To address this
problem, we propose OASIS, an efficient $\textbf{o}$ne-step diffusion model
with $\textbf{a}$ttention $\textbf{s}$pecialization for real-world
v$\textbf{i}$deo $\textbf{s}$uper-resolution. OASIS incorporates an attention
specialization routing that assigns attention heads to different patterns
according to their intrinsic behaviors. This routing mitigates redundancy while
effectively preserving pretrained knowledge, allowing diffusion models to
better adapt to VSR and achieve stronger performance. Moreover, we propose a
simple yet effective progressive training strategy, which starts with
temporally consistent degradations and then shifts to inconsistent settings.
This strategy facilitates learning under complex degradations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that OASIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both synthetic and real-world datasets. OASIS also provides superior inference
speed, offering a $\textbf{6.2$\times$}$ speedup over one-step diffusion
baselines such as SeedVR2. The code will be available at

*Dongki Jung,Jaehoon Choi,Yonghan Lee,Dinesh Manocha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RPG360, a training-free method for 360-degree monocular depth estimation using perspective foundation models and graph optimization, achieving robust performance on diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing application of 360-degree images necessitates robust depth estimation techniques, but large-scale labeled datasets for this purpose are difficult to obtain.

Method: RPG360 converts 360-degree images into cubemap representations, employs foundation models for depth and normal estimation, and uses graph-based optimization for depth scale alignment across cubemap faces.

Result: The method demonstrates superior zero-shot performance on datasets such as Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, and 360Loc, and shows improvements in downstream tasks like feature matching and Structure from Motion.

Conclusion: RPG360 delivers consistent and robust 360-degree depth estimation without the need for training, addressing depth scale inconsistencies and enabling improved downstream applications.

Abstract: The increasing use of 360 images across various domains has emphasized the
need for robust depth estimation techniques tailored for omnidirectional
images. However, obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth
estimation remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose RPG360, a
training-free robust 360 monocular depth estimation method that leverages
perspective foundation models and graph optimization. Our approach converts 360
images into six-face cubemap representations, where a perspective foundation
model is employed to estimate depth and surface normals. To address depth scale
inconsistencies across different faces of the cubemap, we introduce a novel
depth scale alignment technique using graph-based optimization, which
parameterizes the predicted depth and normal maps while incorporating an
additional per-face scale parameter. This optimization ensures depth scale
consistency across the six-face cubemap while preserving 3D structural
integrity. Furthermore, as foundation models exhibit inherent robustness in
zero-shot settings, our method achieves superior performance across diverse
datasets, including Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, and 360Loc. We also demonstrate
the versatility of our depth estimation approach by validating its benefits in
downstream tasks such as feature matching 3.2 ~ 5.4% and Structure from Motion
0.2 ~ 9.7% in AUC@5.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ACS diagnosis via coronary angiography is effective but invasive, resource-intensive, and delays treatment. The paper aims to develop a non-invasive alternative for quicker and accurate decision-making.

Method: TREAT-Net employs a multimodal deep learning approach using echocardiography videos and clinical data, incorporating cross-attention and late fusion mechanisms to enhance prediction capabilities.

Result: The model, trained on over 9000 ACS cases, achieved a balanced accuracy of 67.6%, AUROC of 71.1%, and 88.6% accuracy in cross-modality intervention prediction.

Conclusion: TREAT-Net demonstrates potential to serve as a non-invasive and accurate ACS triage tool, particularly benefiting areas with limited access to coronary angiography.

Abstract: Coronary angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosing Acute Coronary
Syndrome (ACS). However, its resource-intensive and invasive nature can expose
patients to procedural risks and diagnostic delays, leading to postponed
treatment initiation. In this work, we introduce TREAT-Net, a multimodal deep
learning framework for ACS treatment prediction that leverages non-invasive
modalities, including echocardiography videos and structured clinical records.
TREAT-Net integrates tabular-guided cross-attention to enhance video
interpretation, along with a late fusion mechanism to align predictions across
modalities. Trained on a dataset of over 9000 ACS cases, the model outperforms
unimodal and non-fused baselines, achieving a balanced accuracy of 67.6% and an
AUROC of 71.1%. Cross-modality agreement analysis demonstrates 88.6% accuracy
for intervention prediction. These findings highlight the potential of
TREAT-Net as a non-invasive tool for timely and accurate patient triage,
particularly in underserved populations with limited access to coronary
angiography.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to solve the challenge of creating detailed and realistic 3D avatars from a single image while providing intuitive text-based control over expressions.

Method: SIE3D integrates identity features and semantic text embedding using a novel conditioning scheme for precise control. It also employs a perceptual expression loss function to ensure the expressions align with the text, leveraging a pre-trained expression classifier.

Result: Experiments show that SIE3D achieves state-of-the-art results in both identity preservation and expressive realism, even on consumer-grade GPUs.

Conclusion: SIE3D significantly enhances the realism and controllability of 3D avatar generation, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D head avatars from a single image is challenging,
as current methods lack fine-grained, intuitive control over expressions via
text. This paper proposes SIE3D, a framework that generates expressive 3D
avatars from a single image and descriptive text. SIE3D fuses identity features
from the image with semantic embedding from text through a novel conditioning
scheme, enabling detailed control. To ensure generated expressions accurately
match the text, it introduces an innovative perceptual expression loss
function. This loss uses a pre-trained expression classifier to regularize the
generation process, guaranteeing expression accuracy. Extensive experiments
show SIE3D significantly improves controllability and realism, outperforming
competitive methods in identity preservation and expression fidelity on a
single consumer-grade GPU. Project page:

### [542] [FrameMind: Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought for Video Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24008)
*Haonan Ge,Yiwei Wang,Kai-Wei Chang,Hang Wu,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrameMind enhances video understanding with a dynamic approach rather than fixed frame sampling, using reinforcement learning and a multi-turn reasoning method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of static frame sampling in video understanding models, which struggle with tasks requiring flexible temporal or spatial reasoning.

Method: The proposed method, FrameMind, employs a reinforcement learning framework to enable dynamic frame sampling, powered by a Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (FiCOT) process. Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS) and the DRFS-GRPO algorithm are key components of the methodology.

Result: Their approach achieved superior performance on challenging video understanding benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: FrameMind demonstrates significant advantages in flexible and efficient video reasoning, setting a new standard for adaptive video understanding models.

Abstract: Current video understanding models rely on fixed frame sampling strategies,
processing predetermined visual inputs regardless of the specific reasoning
requirements of each question. This static approach limits their ability to
adaptively gather visual evidence, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks
that require either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail. In
this paper, we introduce FrameMind, an end-to-end framework trained with
reinforcement learning that enables models to dynamically request visual
information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought
(FiCOT). Unlike traditional approaches, FrameMind operates in multiple turns
where the model alternates between textual reasoning and active visual
perception, using tools to extract targeted frames or video clips based on
identified knowledge gaps. To train effective dynamic sampling policies, we
propose Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS), which exposes models to
diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs during learning, and DRFS-GRPO, a
group-relative policy optimization algorithm that learns from outcome-based
rewards without requiring frame-level annotations. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the state of the art in
flexible and efficient video understanding.

### [543] [Generalized Category Discovery in Hyperspectral Images via Prototype Subspace Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24017)
*Xianlu Li,Nicolas Nadisic,Shaoguang Huang,Aleksandra Pizurica*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework for generalized category discovery (GCD) focusing on hyperspectral images (HSI), improving upon prior methods by modeling categories as subspaces rather than single prototype vectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of existing GCD models, which fail to handle the complex, high-dimensional nature of hyperspectral images.

Method: The paper proposes modeling each category using multiple basis vectors (subspaces) aided by constraints: basis orthogonality to ensure inter-class separation and reconstruction ability for effective sample representation.

Result: Experimental results revealed substantial performance improvements over current state-of-the-art GCD methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a robust foundation for applying generalized category discovery methods to hyperspectral data contexts.

Abstract: Generalized category discovery~(GCD) seeks to jointly identify both known and
novel categories in unlabeled data. While prior works have mainly focused on
RGB images, their assumptions and modeling strategies do not generalize well to
hyperspectral images~(HSI), which are inherently high-dimensional and exhibit
complex spectral structures. In this paper, we propose the first GCD framework
tailored for HSI, introducing a prototype subspace modeling model to better
capture class structure. Instead of learning a single prototype vector for each
category as in existing methods such as SimGCD, we model each category using a
set of basis vectors, forming a subspace representation that enables greater
expressiveness and discrimination in a high-dimensional feature space. To guide
the learning of such bases, we enforce two key constraints: (1) a basis
orthogonality constraint that promotes inter-class separability, and (2) a
reconstruction constraint that ensures each prototype basis can effectively
reconstruct its corresponding class samples. Experimental results on real-world
HSI demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCD
methods, establishing a strong foundation for generalized category discovery in
hyperspectral settings.

*Jian Chen,Zhuoran Zheng,Han Hu,Guijuan Zhang,Dianjie Lu,Liang Li,Chen Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep learning model for improved pedestrian trajectory prediction in hazy weather, combining physical atmospheric modeling with advanced pedestrian interaction modeling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the physical information degradation and ineffective modeling of pedestrian interactions under hazy weather conditions, which challenge current trajectory prediction algorithms.

Method: The proposed method consists of three components: a differentiable atmospheric scattering model for haze-mitigated feature representation, an adaptive scanning state space model for feature extraction, and a heterogeneous graph attention network to model pedestrian relationships and spatio-temporal interactions.

Result: The new approach achieves a 78% increase in inference speed compared to native Mamba and significant reductions in minADE/minFDE metrics (37.2% and 41.5%, respectively) in dense haze scenarios.

Conclusion: This model offers a novel paradigm for reliable pedestrian trajectory prediction under adverse conditions, significantly enhancing intelligent transportation systems' performance in hazy environments.

Abstract: To address the issues of physical information degradation and ineffective
pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy
weather conditions, we propose a deep learning model that combines physical
priors of atmospheric scattering with topological modeling of pedestrian
relationships. Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric
scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation
through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of
haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning
state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a
78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range
dependency modeling.
  Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a
heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model
multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a
spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns
of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian
trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE /
minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in
dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for
reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse
environments.

*Nate Rothschild,Moshe Kimhi,Avi Mendelson,Chaim Baskin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper argues that training reconstruction networks directly on raw Bayer mosaics achieves superior results compared to using post-ISP sRGB images, particularly for rain degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether bypassing the image-signal-processing (ISP) pipeline and working with raw Bayer mosaics can improve image reconstruction quality and efficiency.

Method: The authors evaluate reconstruction pipelines on raw Bayer and post-ISP sRGB images, curate a new benchmark dataset called Raw-Rain, and propose a novel metric, Information Conservation Score (ICS), for assessing reconstruction quality.

Result: Their raw-domain model outperforms models trained on sRGB by up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2% ICS, while being faster and computationally more efficient.

Conclusion: The findings support adopting an ISP-last approach for improved low-level vision tasks and suggest the feasibility of end-to-end learnable camera pipelines.

Abstract: Image reconstruction from corrupted images is crucial across many domains.
Most reconstruction networks are trained on post-ISP sRGB images, even though
the image-signal-processing pipeline irreversibly mixes colors, clips dynamic
range, and blurs fine detail. This paper uses the rain degradation problem as a
use case to show that these losses are avoidable, and demonstrates that
learning directly on raw Bayer mosaics yields superior reconstructions. To
substantiate the claim, we (i) evaluate post-ISP and Bayer reconstruction
pipelines, (ii) curate Raw-Rain, the first public benchmark of real rainy
scenes captured in both 12-bit Bayer and bit-depth-matched sRGB, and (iii)
introduce Information Conservation Score (ICS), a color-invariant metric that
aligns more closely with human opinion than PSNR or SSIM. On the test split,
our raw-domain model improves sRGB results by up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2%

### [546] [Joint Superpixel and Self-Representation Learning for Scalable Hyperspectral Image Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24027)
*Xianlu Li,Nicolas Nadisic,Shaoguang Huang,Aleksandra Pizurica*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an end-to-end framework integrating superpixel segmentation with subspace clustering to optimize hyperspectral image analysis, achieving high efficiency and superior accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for hyperspectral image analysis suffer from scalability issues due to high computational and memory costs. Superpixel segmentation helps efficiency, but current approaches produce unsatisfactory partitions for clustering.

Method: The proposed method includes a unified framework where superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering are jointly optimized using a feedback mechanism driven by a self-representation network based on unfolded ADMM, guiding a differentiable superpixel module.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark hyperspectral image datasets showed that the approach yielded clustering-aware partitions and consistently outperformed state-of-the-art clustering methods in accuracy.

Conclusion: Jointly optimizing segmentation and clustering using a model-driven feedback system results in efficient, accurate, and adaptive hyperspectral image analysis that aligns spectral and spatial structures effectively.

Abstract: Subspace clustering is a powerful unsupervised approach for hyperspectral
image (HSI) analysis, but its high computational and memory costs limit
scalability. Superpixel segmentation can improve efficiency by reducing the
number of data points to process. However, existing superpixel-based methods
usually perform segmentation independently of the clustering task, often
producing partitions that do not align with the subsequent clustering
objective. To address this, we propose a unified end-to-end framework that
jointly optimizes superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering. Its core is
a feedback mechanism: a self-representation network based on unfolded
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) provides a model-driven
signal to guide a differentiable superpixel module. This joint optimization
yields clustering-aware partitions that preserve both spectral and spatial
structure. Furthermore, our superpixel network learns a unique compactness
parameter for each superpixel, enabling more flexible and adaptive
segmentation. Extensive experiments on benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves superior accuracy compared with
state-of-the-art clustering approaches.

*Leonardo Iurada,Beatrice Occhiena,Tatiana Tommasi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the impact of data on pruning pre-trained vision models, finding that pruning one task preserves zero-shot performance on other tasks while fine-tuning enhances adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in deploying pre-trained vision models due to storage and computational costs, and investigate pruning without needing task-specific data.

Method: Analyzed pruning effects by applying it on pre-trained vision models with a focus on task performance retention and fine-tuning adaptability.

Result: Pruning on one task retains zero-shot performance on unseen tasks, and fine-tuning pruned models improves performance across original and held-out tasks.

Conclusion: Efficient task-specific adaptation can be achieved without task-specific data, thanks to the favorable loss landscapes of pre-trained models.

Abstract: The widespread availability of pre-trained vision models has enabled numerous
deep learning applications through their transferable representations. However,
their computational and storage costs often limit practical deployment.
Pruning-at-Initialization has emerged as a promising approach to compress
models before training, enabling efficient task-specific adaptation. While
conventional wisdom suggests that effective pruning requires task-specific
data, this creates a challenge when downstream tasks are unknown in advance. In
this paper, we investigate how data influences the pruning of pre-trained
vision models. Surprisingly, pruning on one task retains the model's zero-shot
performance also on unseen tasks. Furthermore, fine-tuning these pruned models
not only improves performance on original seen tasks but can recover held-out
tasks' performance. We attribute this phenomenon to the favorable loss
landscapes induced by extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Grounding IDs, symbolic mechanisms bolstered by external cues to improve multimodal binding in large vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring deficiencies in structured reasoning and precise grounding in large vision-language models and understanding how external cues improve performance.

Method: Representation analysis and causal interventions are employed to study latent identifiers arising from external visual cues in large vision-language models.

Result: Grounding IDs reduce the gap between image and text modalities, mediate object-symbolic cue binding, and strengthen attention between related components.

Conclusion: Grounding IDs enhance multimodal grounding, reduce hallucinations, and offer interpretability and practical robustness improvements in vision-language models.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) show strong performance across
multimodal benchmarks but remain limited in structured reasoning and precise
grounding. Recent work has demonstrated that adding simple visual structures,
such as partitions and annotations, improves accuracy, yet the internal
mechanisms underlying these gains remain unclear. We investigate this
phenomenon and propose the concept of Grounding IDs, latent identifiers induced
by external cues that bind objects to their designated partitions across
modalities. Through representation analysis, we find that these identifiers
emerge as robust within-partition alignment in embedding space and reduce the
modality gap between image and text. Causal interventions further confirm that
these identifiers mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues. We show
that Grounding IDs strengthen attention between related components, which in
turn improves cross-modal grounding and reduces hallucinations. Taken together,
our results identify Grounding IDs as a key symbolic mechanism explaining how
external cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and
practical improvements in robustness.

*Sucheng Ren,Chen Chen,Zhenbang Wang,Liangchen Song,Xiangxin Zhu,Alan Yuille,Yinfei Yang,Jiasen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VideoAR, a novel framework for video generation that moves beyond frame-based prediction, opting for spatiotemporal cubes as the prediction unit. This approach results in better quality, speed, and coherence compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To question whether frames are the optimal basic prediction unit in video generation and propose alternatives for more effective video modeling.

Method: The VideoAR framework explores different prediction units, such as full frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes. It utilizes spatiotemporal cubes to model videos autoregressively across both spatial and temporal dimensions.

Result: Cube-based prediction units outperform other strategies and state-of-the-art baselines in video quality, inference speed, temporal coherence, and scalability to longer sequences.

Conclusion: Using spatiotemporal cubes rather than frames for video generation leads to significant improvements across multiple dimensions, challenging the default frame-by-frame approach. This insight may inspire new sequence decomposition methods for spatiotemporal tasks.

Abstract: Autoregressive models for video generation typically operate frame-by-frame,
extending next-token prediction from language to video's temporal dimension. We
question that unlike word as token is universally agreed in language if frame
is a appropriate prediction unit? To address this, we present VideoAR, a
unified framework that supports a spectrum of prediction units including full
frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes.
Among these designs, we find model video generation using
\textit{spatiotemporal} cubes as prediction units, which allows autoregressive
models to operate across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously.
This approach eliminates the assumption that frames are the natural atomic
units for video autoregression. We evaluate VideoAR across diverse prediction
strategies, finding that cube-based prediction consistently delivers superior
quality, speed, and temporal coherence. By removing the frame-by-frame
constraint, our video generator surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on VBench
while achieving faster inference and enabling seamless scaling to minute-long
sequences. We hope this work will motivate rethinking sequence decomposition in
video and other spatiotemporal domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of generating realistic two-person motion in digital spaces, which is essential for applications in computer graphics, animation, and human-computer interaction.

Method: DualFlow employs rectified flow for deterministic sampling paths and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module for semantic grounding, along with synchronization loss and contrastive objectives.

Result: The method shows consistent improvement in motion quality, responsiveness, and efficiency across various benchmarks, including text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and multi-modal settings.

Conclusion: DualFlow improves motion generation with enhanced semantic alignment and synchronization, setting new standards in multi-modal two-person motion generation.

Abstract: Generating realistic, context-aware two-person motion conditioned on diverse
modalities remains a central challenge in computer graphics, animation, and
human-computer interaction. We introduce DualFlow, a unified and efficient
framework for multi-modal two-person motion generation. DualFlow conditions 3D
motion synthesis on diverse inputs, including text, music, and prior motion
sequences. Leveraging rectified flow, it achieves deterministic straight-line
sampling paths between noise and data, reducing inference time and mitigating
error accumulation common in diffusion-based models. To enhance semantic
grounding, DualFlow employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that
retrieves motion exemplars using music features and LLM-based text
decompositions of spatial relations, body movements, and rhythmic patterns. We
use contrastive objective that further strengthens alignment with conditioning
signals and introduce synchronization loss that improves inter-person
coordination. Extensive evaluations across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and
multi-modal interactive benchmarks show consistent gains in motion quality,
responsiveness, and efficiency. DualFlow produces temporally coherent and
rhythmically synchronized motions, setting state-of-the-art in multi-modal
human motion generation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SVAC, a model for referring video object segmentation, addressing challenges with computational costs, temporal dynamics, and leveraging prior knowledge from multi-modal large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve RVOS by overcoming challenges such as computational constraints, handling of dynamic object behaviors, and underutilization of the prior knowledge in multi-modal models.

Method: The authors developed SVAC, featuring two key components: ASTC for compressing visual tokens without losing spatio-temporal structure and CSA strategy for managing dynamic objects across video clips.

Result: SVAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on RVOS benchmarks with improved efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SVAC offers a robust solution for RVOS tasks by enhancing text-video interaction, processing efficiency, and handling complex temporal dynamics.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment target objects in
video sequences based on natural language descriptions. While recent advances
in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have improved RVOS performance
through enhanced text-video understanding, several challenges remain, including
insufficient exploitation of MLLMs' prior knowledge, prohibitive computational
and memory costs for long-duration videos, and inadequate handling of complex
temporal dynamics. In this work, we propose SVAC, a unified model that improves
RVOS by scaling up input frames and segmentation tokens to enhance
video-language interaction and segmentation precision. To address the resulting
computational challenges, SVAC incorporates the Anchor-Based Spatio-Temporal
Compression (ASTC) module to compress visual tokens while preserving essential
spatio-temporal structure. Moreover, the Clip-Specific Allocation (CSA)
strategy is introduced to better handle dynamic object behaviors across video
clips. Experimental results demonstrate that SVAC achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple RVOS benchmarks with competitive efficiency. Our code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "GMS," a framework combining general vision-language models and GUI-specific models to improve GUI grounding accuracy. GMS achieves 10x better performance than standalone models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of grounding natural language queries in GUIs by leveraging complementary strengths of generalist and specialist models.

Method: A coarse-to-fine framework where a general vision-language model (Scanner) identifies regions of interest, and a fine-tuned GUI grounding model (Locator) outputs precise coordinates.

Result: The GMS framework achieves 35.7% accuracy on the ScreenSpot-Pro dataset, a 10x improvement compared to using the models independently.

Conclusion: Integrating generalist and specialist models within the GMS framework leads to significant improvements in GUI grounding tasks, outperforming baselines and demonstrating robustness.

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents a challenging task that requires models to comprehend diverse UI
elements across various applications and systems, while also accurately
predicting the spatial coordinates for the intended operation. To tackle this
problem, we propose GMS: Generalist Scanner Meets Specialist Locator, a
synergistic coarse-to-fine framework that effectively improves GUI grounding
performance. GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general
vision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by
assigning them distinct roles within the framework. Specifically, the general
VLM acts as a 'Scanner' to identify potential regions of interest, while the
fine-tuned grounding model serves as a 'Locator' that outputs precise
coordinates within these regions. This design is inspired by how humans perform
GUI grounding, where the eyes scan the interface and the brain focuses on
interpretation and localization. Our whole framework consists of five stages
and incorporates hierarchical search with cross-modal communication to achieve
promising prediction results. Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro
dataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only $2.0\%$
and $3.7\%$ accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration
within GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of $35.7\%$, representing a $10
\times$ improvement. Additionally, GMS significantly outperforms other strong
baselines under various settings, demonstrating its robustness and potential
for general-purpose GUI grounding.

Motivation: With over 2.2 billion people affected by vision impairment globally, accurate and efficient retinal disease diagnosis is necessary to prevent vision loss and mitigate the associated economic burdens. Traditional manual grading by experts is slow and subjective, prompting a need for automated solutions.

Method: The study employs the EYE-DEX framework to classify 10 retinal conditions using a dataset of 21,577 fundus images.

Conclusion: EYE-DEX proves to be a reliable and accurate tool for retinal disease diagnostics. Its integration with Grad-CAM enhances transparency, thus bolstering clinician trust in AI-driven medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Retinal disease diagnosis is critical in preventing vision loss and reducing
socioeconomic burdens. Globally, over 2.2 billion people are affected by some
form of vision impairment, resulting in annual productivity losses estimated at
$411 billion. Traditional manual grading of retinal fundus images by
ophthalmologists is time-consuming and subjective. In contrast, deep learning
has revolutionized medical diagnostics by automating retinal image analysis and
achieving expert-level performance. In this study, we present EYE-DEX, an
automated framework for classifying 10 retinal conditions using the large-scale
Retinal Disease Dataset comprising 21,577 eye fundus images. We benchmark three
pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models--VGG16, VGG19, and
ResNet50--with our finetuned VGG16 achieving a state-of-the-art global
benchmark test accuracy of 92.36%. To enhance transparency and explainability,
we integrate the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)
technique to generate visual explanations highlighting disease-specific

TL;DR: The paper identifies ethnicity-based bias in AI facial beauty prediction systems through analysis and proposes strategies for mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the societal concerns regarding AI systems perpetuating aesthetic biases, particularly ethnicity-based biases in facial beauty prediction models.

Method: Comparative analysis of models trained on SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty datasets using statistical validation (e.g., Kruskal-Wallis H-tests and post hoc Dunn analyses) and cross-dataset validations.

Result: Both analyzed models reveal significant prediction disparities across ethnic groups, with algorithmic amplification of societal beauty biases evident even on balanced datasets ($p < 0.001$). Less than 10% of inter-group comparisons satisfy distributional parity.

Conclusion: Current AI beauty prediction models are inadequate in addressing biases, necessitating the adoption of more equitable strategies to ensure fairness in aesthetic assessments.

Abstract: Bias can be introduced to AI systems even from seemingly balanced sources,
and AI facial beauty prediction is subject to ethnicity-based bias. This work
sounds warnings about AI's role in shaping aesthetic norms while providing
potential pathways toward equitable beauty technologies through comparative
analysis of models trained on SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty datasets. Employing
rigorous statistical validation (Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, post hoc Dunn
analyses). It is demonstrated that both models exhibit significant prediction
disparities across ethnic groups $(p < 0.001)$, even when evaluated on the
balanced FairFace dataset. Cross-dataset validation shows algorithmic
amplification of societal beauty biases rather than mitigation based on
prediction and error parity. The findings underscore the inadequacy of current
AI beauty prediction approaches, with only 4.8-9.5\% of inter-group comparisons
satisfying distributional parity criteria. Mitigation strategies are proposed
and discussed in detail.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) models have improved performance but still face challenges in inference efficiency, despite reducing sampling steps.

Method: FastVSR uses a high-compression VAE with a spatial compression ratio of 16, stable training frameworks, pixel shuffle, channel replication, and a lower-bound-guided training strategy to improve performance and efficiency.

Result: Experimental results indicate that FastVSR achieves 111.9x speedup over multi-step models and 3.92x over existing one-step models.

Conclusion: FastVSR not only enhances computational efficiency significantly but also stabilizes training, making it a groundbreaking step in video super-resolution.

Abstract: Diffusion models have significant advantages in the field of real-world video
super-resolution and have demonstrated strong performance in past research. In
recent diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) models, the number of
sampling steps has been reduced to just one, yet there remains significant room
for further optimization in inference efficiency. In this paper, we propose
FastVSR, which achieves substantial reductions in computational cost by
implementing a high compression VAE (spatial compression ratio of 16, denoted
as f16). We design the structure of the f16 VAE and introduce a stable training
framework. We employ pixel shuffle and channel replication to achieve
additional upsampling. Furthermore, we propose a lower-bound-guided training
strategy, which introduces a simpler training objective as a lower bound for
the VAE's performance. It makes the training process more stable and easier to
converge. Experimental results show that FastVSR achieves speedups of 111.9
times compared to multi-step models and 3.92 times compared to existing
one-step models. We will release code and models at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LatXGen is a novel framework that generates realistic lateral spinal radiographs from RGBD images of unclothed backs. It aims to provide an accurate, radiation-free assessment of sagittal spinal alignment for AIS evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for sagittal spinal alignment in AIS often rely on ionizing radiation, which poses health risks. A radiation-free alternative is needed to perform accurate and reliable assessments.

Method: LatXGen employs a dual-stage architecture combining attention-based Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) for anatomical feature integration and a Spatial Deformation Network (SDN) for modeling spinal morphology. It uses paired RGBD and lateral radiograph data for training.

Result: LatXGen synthesizes anatomically sound radiographs with superior visual fidelity and accuracy compared to GAN-based methods. A large dataset of 3,264 paired samples was utilized for validation.

Conclusion: LatXGen offers a groundbreaking method for radiation-free sagittal spine assessment, paving the way for safer and reliable AIS evaluation techniques.

Abstract: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a complex three-dimensional spinal
deformity, and accurate morphological assessment requires evaluating both
coronal and sagittal alignment. While previous research has made significant
progress in developing radiation-free methods for coronal plane assessment,
reliable and accurate evaluation of sagittal alignment without ionizing
radiation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose
LatXGen, a novel generative framework that synthesizes realistic lateral spinal
radiographs from posterior Red-Green-Blue and Depth (RGBD) images of unclothed
backs. This enables accurate, radiation-free estimation of sagittal spinal
alignment. LatXGen tackles two core challenges: (1) inferring sagittal spinal
morphology changes from a lateral perspective based on posteroanterior surface
geometry, and (2) performing cross-modality translation from RGBD input to the
radiographic domain. The framework adopts a dual-stage architecture that
progressively estimates lateral spinal structure and synthesizes corresponding
radiographs. To enhance anatomical consistency, we introduce an attention-based
Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) module for integrating anatomical features from
RGBD images and 3D landmarks, and a Spatial Deformation Network (SDN) to model
morphological variations in the lateral view. Additionally, we construct the
first large-scale paired dataset for this task, comprising 3,264 RGBD and
lateral radiograph pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that LatXGen
produces anatomically accurate radiographs and outperforms existing GAN-based
methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics. This study offers a
promising, radiation-free solution for sagittal spine assessment and advances
comprehensive AIS evaluation.

Result: Experiments on medical image classification show improved distillation performance, with model accuracy comparable to original datasets, and privacy preserved.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective in distilling medical datasets, retaining essential information for training while addressing privacy concerns.

Abstract: Medical image analysis faces significant challenges in data sharing due to
privacy regulations and complex institutional protocols. Dataset distillation
offers a solution to address these challenges by synthesizing compact datasets
that capture essential information from real, large medical datasets.
Trajectory matching has emerged as a promising methodology for dataset
distillation; however, existing methods primarily focus on terminal states,
overlooking crucial information in intermediate optimization states. We address
this limitation by proposing a shape-wise potential that captures the geometric
structure of parameter trajectories, and an easy-to-complex matching strategy
that progressively addresses parameters based on their complexity. Experiments
on medical image classification tasks demonstrate that our method improves
distillation performance while preserving privacy and maintaining model

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DECERN introduces a new method combining discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity for more effective sample selection in fine-grained image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the difficulty in assessing sample informativeness in fine-grained image classification for active learning due to subtle inter-class differences.

Method: DECERN uses a multifaceted informativeness measure combining discrepancy-confusion uncertainty for category directionality and structural stability, followed by uncertainty-weighted clustering and calibrated diversity.

Result: Experiments on 7 datasets and 26 settings showed DECERN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in active fine-grained image classification.

Conclusion: DECERN effectively improves sample selection by integrating uncertainty and diversity measures, enhancing active learning performance in fine-grained image scenarios.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) aims to build high-quality labeled datasets by
iteratively selecting the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool under
limited annotation budgets. However, in fine-grained image classification,
assessing this informativeness is especially challenging due to subtle
inter-class differences. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, combining
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity for active
fine-grained image classification (DECERN), to effectively perceive the
distinctiveness between fine-grained images and evaluate the sample value.
DECERN introduces a multifaceted informativeness measure that combines
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity. The
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty quantifies the category directionality and
structural stability of fine-grained unlabeled data during local feature
fusion. Subsequently, uncertainty-weighted clustering is performed to diversify
the uncertainty samples. Then we calibrate the diversity to maximize the global
diversity of the selected sample while maintaining its local
representativeness. Extensive experiments conducted on 7 fine-grained image
datasets across 26 distinct experimental settings demonstrate that our method
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a GAN and diffusion model-based approach to generate customizable 3D tumor images using radiomics features for enhanced medical imaging applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image analysis often suffers from privacy issues, limiting access to large datasets, especially for 3D images like CT and MRI. Existing generative models lack diversity in representing 3D medical images effectively.

Method: The proposed method uses a GAN-based model to generate tumor masks and a diffusion-based model for tumor texture, conditioned on biologically grounded radiomics features, allowing precise customization by users.

Result: The model successfully synthesizes diverse tumor images for kidney, lung, breast, and brain across CT and MRI modalities. Synthesized images demonstrated utility in training downstream tasks and were validated by medical experts.

Conclusion: This method offers a promising solution for generating realistic and diverse tumor images, aiding physicians in visualization, treatment planning, and improving training datasets for medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Due to privacy concerns, obtaining large datasets is challenging in medical
image analysis, especially with 3D modalities like Computed Tomography (CT) and
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing generative models, developed to
address this issue, often face limitations in output diversity and thus cannot
accurately represent 3D medical images. We propose a tumor-generation model
that utilizes radiomics features as generative conditions. Radiomics features
are high-dimensional handcrafted semantic features that are biologically
well-grounded and thus are good candidates for conditioning. Our model employs
a GAN-based model to generate tumor masks and a diffusion-based approach to
generate tumor texture conditioned on radiomics features. Our method allows the
user to generate tumor images according to user-specified radiomics features
such as size, shape, and texture at an arbitrary location. This enables the
physicians to easily visualize tumor images to better understand tumors
according to changing radiomics features. Our approach allows for the removal,
manipulation, and repositioning of tumors, generating various tumor types in
different scenarios. The model has been tested on tumors in four different
organs (kidney, lung, breast, and brain) across CT and MRI. The synthesized
images are shown to effectively aid in training for downstream tasks and their
authenticity was also evaluated through expert evaluations. Our method has
potential usage in treatment planning with diverse synthesized tumors.

*Jonghun Kim,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study leverages a diffusion model and prompt tuning to predict post-treatment images after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients, showing improved image quality and tumor response prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of NAC response is crucial for effective treatment planning in breast cancer patients.

Method: Adopt maximum intensity projection images from DCE-MRI and use an emerging diffusion model with prompt tuning to predict post-treatment images.

Result: The proposed model outperformed other generative models in image quality and accurately reflected tumor size changes according to pathological complete response (pCR).

Conclusion: The approach has potential applications in precision medicine by improving treatment monitoring and planning.

Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a common therapy option before the main
surgery for breast cancer. Response to NAC is monitored using follow-up dynamic
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Accurate prediction of
NAC response helps with treatment planning. Here, we adopt maximum intensity
projection images from DCE-MRI to generate post-treatment images (i.e., 3 or 12
weeks after NAC) from pre-treatment images leveraging the emerging diffusion
model. We introduce prompt tuning to account for the known clinical factors
affecting response to NAC. Our model performed better than other generative
models in image quality metrics. Our model was better at generating images that
reflected changes in tumor size according to pCR compared to other models.
Ablation study confirmed the design choices of our method. Our study has the
potential to help with precision medicine.

### [563] [Talk in Pieces, See in Whole: Disentangling and Hierarchical Aggregating Representations for Language-based Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24192)
*Sojung An,Kwanyong Park,Yong Jae Lee,Donghyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations in vision-language models (VLMs) when handling complex linguistic queries by introducing a hierarchical linguistic structure framework called TaSe, leading to a 24% performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite progress in multimodal perception tasks, VLMs struggle with complex text queries due to limitations in their text encoders, which fail to distinguish objects from attributes and relations.

Method: The paper proposes the TaSe framework featuring hierarchical linguistic restructuring, a synthetic captioning dataset, a disentanglement module ('Talk in Pieces'), and aggregation mechanisms ('See in Whole') with novel loss functions and objectives.

Result: TaSe demonstrated a significant 24% improvement in language-based object detection tasks under the OmniLabel benchmark, proving the effectiveness of hierarchical linguistic structures.

Conclusion: Restructuring text embeddings into hierarchical components enhances the multimodal understanding of VLMs, making them more capable of handling complex linguistic queries.

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in
multimodal perception (e.g., open-vocabulary object detection) with simple
language queries, state-of-the-art VLMs still show limited ability to perceive
complex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses. Our
in-depth analysis shows that these limitations mainly stem from text encoders
in VLMs. Such text encoders behave like bags-of-words and fail to separate
target objects from their descriptive attributes and relations in complex
queries, resulting in frequent false positives. To address this, we propose
restructuring linguistic representations according to the hierarchical
relations within sentences for language-based object detection. A key insight
is the necessity of disentangling textual tokens into core components-objects,
attributes, and relations ("talk in pieces")-and subsequently aggregating them
into hierarchically structured sentence-level representations ("see in whole").
Building on this principle, we introduce the TaSe framework with three main
contributions: (1) a hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset spanning three
tiers from category names to descriptive sentences; (2) Talk in Pieces, the
three-component disentanglement module guided by a novel disentanglement loss
function, transforms text embeddings into subspace compositions; and (3) See in
Whole, which learns to aggregate disentangled components into hierarchically
structured embeddings with the guide of proposed hierarchical objectives. The
proposed TaSe framework strengthens the inductive bias of hierarchical
linguistic structures, resulting in fine-grained multimodal representations for
language-based object detection. Experimental results under the OmniLabel
benchmark show a 24% performance improvement, demonstrating the importance of
linguistic compositionality.

### [564] [An Efficient 3D Latent Diffusion Model for T1-contrast Enhanced MRI Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24194)
*Zach Eidex,Mojtaba Safari,Jie Ding,Richard Qiu,Justin Roper,David Yu,Hui-Kuo Shu,Zhen Tian,Hui Mao,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces T1C-RFlow, a 3D deep-learning model that generates synthetic T1-contrast enhanced images from pre-contrast MRI, achieving high accuracy and drastically reduced processing time compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs), used for T1w MRI lesion visualization, pose risks for certain patients and create imaging inconsistencies. This research aims to develop a non-invasive and consistent alternative for generating T1-contrast enhanced images.

Method: The study utilized 3D latent rectified flow diffusion, combining pre-contrast MRI input with a pretrained autoencoder for latent space representation, followed by training with curated datasets of glioma, meningioma, and metastases cases.

Result: The T1C-RFlow significantly outperformed benchmark models in terms of accuracy (e.g., SSIM > 0.90 for tumor reconstruction) and efficiency (denoising time of 6.9 seconds per volume).

Conclusion: T1C-RFlow demonstrates potential as a fast, high-fidelity alternative to GBCA-based imaging. Its adoption could lead to contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumor visualization.

Abstract: Objective: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are commonly employed
with T1w MRI to enhance lesion visualization but are restricted in patients at
risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and variations in GBCA administration can
introduce imaging inconsistencies. This study develops an efficient 3D
deep-learning framework to generate T1-contrast enhanced images (T1C) from
pre-contrast multiparametric MRI. Approach: We propose the 3D latent rectified
flow (T1C-RFlow) model for generating high-quality T1C images. First, T1w and
T2-FLAIR images are input into a pretrained autoencoder to acquire an efficient
latent space representation. A rectified flow diffusion model is then trained
in this latent space representation. The T1C-RFlow model was trained on a
curated dataset comprised of the BraTS 2024 glioma (GLI; 1480 patients),
meningioma (MEN; 1141 patients), and metastases (MET; 1475 patients) datasets.
Selected patients were split into train (N=2860), validation (N=612), and test
(N=614) sets. Results: Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate
that the T1C-RFlow model outperforms benchmark 3D models (pix2pix, DDPM,
Diffusion Transformers (DiT-3D)) trained in the same latent space. T1C-RFlow
achieved the following metrics - GLI: NMSE 0.044 +/- 0.047, SSIM 0.935 +/-
0.025; MEN: NMSE 0.046 +/- 0.029, SSIM 0.937 +/- 0.021; MET: NMSE 0.098 +/-
0.088, SSIM 0.905 +/- 0.082. T1C-RFlow had the best tumor reconstruction
performance and significantly faster denoising times (6.9 s/volume, 200 steps)
than conventional DDPM models in both latent space (37.7s, 1000 steps) and
patch-based in image space (4.3 hr/volume). Significance: Our proposed method
generates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble ground truth T1C in much
less time than previous diffusion models. Further development may permit a
practical method for contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.

*Jiabin Luo,Junhui Lin,Zeyu Zhang,Biao Wu,Meng Fang,Ling Chen,Hao Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces UniVid, a unified framework that combines video generation and understanding by extending image-based machine learning language models (MLLMs) using a diffusion decoder and lightweight adapter. It addresses challenges in text-visual alignment and cross-modal attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenges in unified video modeling, specifically the issues of semantic faithfulness in generation due to text-visual token imbalance, limitations in cross-modal attention, and the difficulty of extending image-centric models to video efficiently.

Method: The authors present UniVid, which employs a lightweight adapter to integrate an MLLM with a diffusion decoder. They introduce two techniques: Temperature Modality Alignment to improve text-visual prompt matching and Pyramid Reflection for dynamic keyframe selection for temporal reasoning.

Result: UniVid achieves state-of-the-art results, including a 2.2% improvement on the VBench-Long total score, and accuracy gains of 1.0% on MSVD-QA and 3.3% on ActivityNet-QA, compared to previous best-performing models.

Conclusion: UniVid successfully addresses major challenges in unified video modeling by offering a more effective and efficient solution, demonstrating advancements in both understanding and generation tasks.

Abstract: Unified video modeling that combines generation and understanding
capabilities is increasingly important but faces two key challenges:
maintaining semantic faithfulness during flow-based generation due to
text-visual token imbalance and the limitations of uniform cross-modal
attention across the flow trajectory, and efficiently extending image-centric
MLLMs to video without costly retraining. We present UniVid, a unified
architecture that couples an MLLM with a diffusion decoder through a
lightweight adapter, enabling both video understanding and generation. We
introduce Temperature Modality Alignment to improve prompt adherence and
Pyramid Reflection for efficient temporal reasoning via dynamic keyframe
selection. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 2.2% improvement on VBench-Long total
score compared to EasyAnimateV5.1, and 1.0% and 3.3% accuracy gains on MSVD-QA
and ActivityNet-QA, respectively, compared with the best prior 7B baselines.

### [566] [BALR-SAM: Boundary-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation of SAM for Resource-Efficient Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24204)
*Zelin Liu,Sicheng Dong,Bocheng Li,Yixuan Yang,Jiacheng Ruan,Chenxu Zhou,Suncheng Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BALR-SAM is a framework designed to improve vision models like SAM for medical imaging by fine-tuning only 1.8% of its parameters, offering better performance with reduced memory and resource requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models trained on natural images often fail in medical imaging tasks due to domain differences. Efficient fine-tuning for medical applications is crucial as resource constraints and high performance requirements make adaptation challenging.

Method: BALR-SAM integrates three innovations: (1) CDEN for enhanced boundary detection, (2) low-rank adapters in Vision Transformer blocks for context-aware adaptation, and (3) low-rank tensor attention in the mask decoder for better efficiency and reduced memory consumption.

Result: BALR-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including MedSAM, on standard medical segmentation tasks while only updating 1.8% (11.7M) of the parameters.

Conclusion: BALR-SAM achieves significant improvements in medical image segmentation with minimal computational resources, making it a highly efficient and effective adaptation technique for clinical use.

Abstract: Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pretrained on
large-scale natural image datasets, often struggle in medical image
segmentation due to a lack of domain-specific adaptation. In clinical practice,
fine-tuning such models efficiently for medical downstream tasks with minimal
resource demands, while maintaining strong performance, is challenging. To
address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation
framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored
components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using
depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture
boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank
adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature
representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously
significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention
mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting
inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show
that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8%
(11.7M) of its parameters.

*Yingdong Hu,Yisheng He,Jinnan Chen,Weihao Yuan,Kejie Qiu,Zehong Lin,Siyu Zhu,Zilong Dong,Jun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Forge4D proposes a fast and efficient feed-forward model for reconstructing and interpolating dynamic 3D human representations from sparse, uncalibrated videos, enabling novel viewpoint and time synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reconstructing dynamic 3D humans are either slow or unable to generate novel-time representations, limiting their application potential.

Method: Forge4D simplifies the problem into two tasks: streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction using learnable tokens for temporal consistency, and novel time synthesis via dense motion prediction with self-supervised losses for plausible human movement.

Result: Extensive experiments show Forge4D's effectiveness across diverse datasets, demonstrating its capability in generating temporally aligned 4D reconstructions.

Conclusion: Forge4D offers a scalable and memory-efficient solution for dynamic 3D human reconstruction, addressing limitations in speed and temporal synthesis seen in prior approaches.

Abstract: Instant reconstruction of dynamic 3D humans from uncalibrated sparse-view
videos is critical for numerous downstream applications. Existing methods,
however, are either limited by the slow reconstruction speeds or incapable of
generating novel-time representations. To address these challenges, we propose
Forge4D, a feed-forward 4D human reconstruction and interpolation model that
efficiently reconstructs temporally aligned representations from uncalibrated
sparse-view videos, enabling both novel view and novel time synthesis. Our
model simplifies the 4D reconstruction and interpolation problem as a joint
task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction and dense motion prediction. For
the task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction, we first reconstruct static
3D Gaussians from uncalibrated sparse-view images and then introduce learnable
state tokens to enforce temporal consistency in a memory-friendly manner by
interactively updating shared information across different timestamps. For
novel time synthesis, we design a novel motion prediction module to predict
dense motions for each 3D Gaussian between two adjacent frames, coupled with an
occlusion-aware Gaussian fusion process to interpolate 3D Gaussians at
arbitrary timestamps. To overcome the lack of the ground truth for dense motion
supervision, we formulate dense motion prediction as a dense point matching
task and introduce a self-supervised retargeting loss to optimize this module.
An additional occlusion-aware optical flow loss is introduced to ensure motion
consistency with plausible human movement, providing stronger regularization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Project page and code at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AVF-MAE++, an improved audio-visual Masked Autoencoder designed for affective video facial analysis (AVFA), addressing challenges of scalable representation learning and cross-modal correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limited data availability and challenges in scalable audio-visual representation learning crucial for emotion-aware systems.

Method: The framework incorporates a dual masking strategy, enhanced modality encoders, an Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module, and a progressive semantic injection strategy.

Result: Experiments on 17 datasets across three major AVFA tasks show that AVF-MAE++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the contribution of proposed components.

Conclusion: AVF-MAE++ effectively improves scalable audio-visual representation learning and cross-modal correlation modeling, setting new benchmarks in AVFA research.

Abstract: Affective video facial analysis (AVFA) has emerged as a key research field
for building emotion-aware intelligent systems, yet this field continues to
suffer from limited data availability. In recent years, the self-supervised
learning (SSL) technique of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) has gained momentum, with
growing adaptations in its audio-visual contexts. While scaling has proven
essential for breakthroughs in general multi-modal learning domains, its
specific impact on AVFA remains largely unexplored. Another core challenge in
this field is capturing both intra- and inter-modal correlations through
scalable audio-visual representations. To tackle these issues, we propose
AVF-MAE++, a family of audio-visual MAE models designed to efficiently
investigate the scaling properties in AVFA while enhancing cross-modal
correlation modeling. Our framework introduces a novel dual masking strategy
across audio and visual modalities and strengthens modality encoders with a
more holistic design to better support scalable pre-training. Additionally, we
present the Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module, which improves
correlation learning within the SSL paradigm, bridging the limitations of
previous methods. To support smooth adaptation and reduce overfitting risks, we
further introduce a progressive semantic injection strategy, organizing the
model training into three structured stages. Extensive experiments conducted on
17 datasets, covering three major AVFA tasks, demonstrate that AVF-MAE++
achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.
Comprehensive ablation studies further highlight the importance of each
proposed component and provide deeper insights into the design choices driving
these improvements. Our code and models have been publicly released at Github.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current medical AI systems, which are modality-specific and lack transparent reasoning processes hindering clinical adoption.

Method: The model combines supervised learning and visual reinforcement fine-tuning, leveraging over 1.3 million samples across multiple modalities and specialties, with external validation against additional datasets.

Result: EVLF-FM achieved superior performance in diagnostics, visual grounding, and reasoning tasks, outperforming leading models with high accuracy, mIOU, and F1-scores.

Conclusion: EVLF-FM demonstrates that a multimodal, explainable approach can advance medical AI, fostering adoption and trust for real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: Despite the promise of foundation models in medical AI, current systems
remain limited - they are modality-specific and lack transparent reasoning
processes, hindering clinical adoption. To address this gap, we present
EVLF-FM, a multimodal vision-language foundation model (VLM) designed to unify
broad diagnostic capability with fine-grain explainability. The development and
testing of EVLF-FM encompassed over 1.3 million total samples from 23 global
datasets across eleven imaging modalities related to six clinical specialties:
dermatology, hepatology, ophthalmology, pathology, pulmonology, and radiology.
External validation employed 8,884 independent test samples from 10 additional
datasets across five imaging modalities. Technically, EVLF-FM is developed to
assist with multiple disease diagnosis and visual question answering with
pixel-level visual grounding and reasoning capabilities. In internal validation
for disease diagnostics, EVLF-FM achieved the highest average accuracy (0.858)
and F1-score (0.797), outperforming leading generalist and specialist models.
In medical visual grounding, EVLF-FM also achieved stellar performance across
nine modalities with average mIOU of 0.743 and Acc@0.5 of 0.837. External
validations further confirmed strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, with
competitive F1-scores despite a smaller model size. Through a hybrid training
strategy combining supervised and visual reinforcement fine-tuning, EVLF-FM not
only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also exhibits step-by-step
reasoning, aligning outputs with visual evidence. EVLF-FM is an early
multi-disease VLM model with explainability and reasoning capabilities that
could advance adoption of and trust in foundation models for real-world
clinical deployment.

*Bangzheng Li,Ximeng Sun,Jiang Liu,Ze Wang,Jialian Wu,Xiaodong Yu,Hao Chen,Emad Barsoum,Muhao Chen,Zicheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a method for autoregressive reasoning in visual embedding spaces, achieving notable performance improvements in visual question answering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing MLLMs that treat visual information statically and restrict reasoning to language spaces.

Method: The LVR approach trains a language model to generate latent representations in the visual embedding space, interleaving this with text generation. Additionally, it incorporates the GRPO algorithm for reinforcement learning to optimize latent reasoning.

Result: LVR improves fine-grained visual understanding, showing a performance of 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% for Qwen2.5-VL.

Conclusion: LVR significantly enhances perception-intensive tasks by bridging visual and language reasoning spaces, demonstrating potential for future multimodal model development.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable gains in
various tasks by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language
spaces. Recent work extends this direction by leveraging external tools for
visual editing, thereby enhancing the visual signal along the reasoning
trajectories. Nevertheless, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained:
reasoning is still confined to the language space, with visual information
treated as static preconditions. We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a
new paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual
embedding space. A visual encoder first projects images into visual tokens
within a joint semantic space shared with the language model. The language
model is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual
tokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent
visual reasoning. By interleaving LVR with standard text generation, our model
achieves substantial gains on perception-intensive visual question answering
tasks. In addition, we adapt the GRPO algorithm to conduct reinforcement
learning on latent reasoning, further balancing LVR and textual generation. We
show that LVR substantially improves fine-grained visual understanding and
perception, achieving 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. Code
base and model weights will be released later.

*Jinming Liu,Zhaoyang Jia,Jiahao Li,Bin Li,Xin Jin,Wenjun Zeng,Yan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a specialized image codec called CoTAM designed to optimize image compression for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), achieving significant bandwidth savings without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the inefficiency of conventional image codecs, which are designed for human visual fidelity and not optimized for the diverse computational tasks of MLLMs hosted on cloud platforms.

Method: The proposed CoTAM codec uses CLIP's shallow-layer attention to allocate bits based on semantic importance, along with a decoder equipped with a lightweight adapter and multi-level loss function to preserve both low-level details and high-level semantics.

Result: CoTAM achieves up to 35.99% bitrate savings while maintaining comparable levels of performance in MLLM downstream tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art neural codecs.

Conclusion: CoTAM effectively adapts image compression for MLLMs by protecting multi-level image features and optimizing for bandwidth efficiency while supporting diverse downstream tasks.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), typically hosted on cloud platforms, urgently requires effective
compression techniques to efficiently transmit signal inputs (e.g., images,
videos) from edge devices with minimal bandwidth usage. However, conventional
image codecs are optimized for fidelity to serve the Human Visual System (HVS)
and ill-suited for MLLMs, in which diverse downstream tasks are jointly
considered. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the impact of
compression artifacts on several mainstream MLLMs. We find that: Compression
distortion unevenly impacts different-level image features, leading to varying
effects on MLLMs' downstream tasks depending on their feature-level reliance.
Motivated by this discovery, we propose an image Codec TAilored to MLLMs
(CoTAM) designed to adaptively protect multi-level features and suit different
demands of downstream tasks. The encoder leverages CLIP's shallow-layer
attention to generate an importance map for bit allocation, preserving critical
semantic regions. Concurrently, the decoder integrates a lightweight adapter
with a multi-level loss function to ensure the faithful reconstruction both of
low-level details and high-level semantic context for robust synthesis of
cross-level features. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves
up to 35.99\% bitrate saving while maintaining the same performance on the MLLM
tasks, outperforming previous SOTA neural codecs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the significant storage and computational demands of large-scale Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), particularly in resource-constrained environments, and to enhance their compression and acceleration capabilities.

Method: The authors propose a baseline for S$^2$NN by leveraging weight clustering in binary SNNs and introduce two methods: Outlier-aware sub-bit weight quantization (OS-Quant) to optimize codeword selection and membrane potential-based feature distillation (MPFD) to improve model performance through teacher guidance.

Result: The proposed S$^2$NN approach significantly outperforms existing quantized SNNs in terms of both performance and efficiency, as demonstrated by extensive tests across vision and non-vision tasks.

Conclusion: S$^2$NNs represent a promising advancement for deploying efficient and high-performance SNNs in edge computing applications due to their enhanced compression and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient paradigm for machine
intelligence, but their continued scaling poses challenges for resource-limited
deployment. Despite recent advances in binary SNNs, the storage and
computational demands remain substantial for large-scale networks. To further
explore the compression and acceleration potential of SNNs, we propose Sub-bit
Spiking Neural Networks (S$^2$NNs) that represent weights with less than one
bit. Specifically, we first establish an S$^2$NN baseline by leveraging the
clustering patterns of kernels in well-trained binary SNNs. This baseline is
highly efficient but suffers from \textit{outlier-induced codeword selection
bias} during training. To mitigate this issue, we propose an
\textit{outlier-aware sub-bit weight quantization} (OS-Quant) method, which
optimizes codeword selection by identifying and adaptively scaling outliers.
Furthermore, we propose a \textit{membrane potential-based feature
distillation} (MPFD) method, improving the performance of highly compressed
S$^2$NN via more precise guidance from a teacher model. Extensive results on
vision and non-vision tasks reveal that S$^2$NN outperforms existing quantized
SNNs in both performance and efficiency, making it promising for edge computing
applications.

synthesis. However, ensuring conditioning faithfulness and high-quality
synthetic images for direct or counterfactual generation remains a challenge.
In this work, we introduce a cycle training framework to fine-tune diffusion
models for improved conditioning adherence and enhanced synthetic image
realism. Our approach, Cycle Diffusion Model (CDM), enforces consistency
between generated and original images by incorporating cycle constraints,
enabling more reliable direct and counterfactual generation. Experiments on a
combined 3D brain MRI dataset (from ABCD, HCP aging & young adults, ADNI, and
PPMI) show that our method improves conditioning accuracy and enhances image
quality as measured by FID and SSIM. The results suggest that the cycle
strategy used in CDM can be an effective method for refining diffusion-based
medical image generation, with applications in data augmentation,
counterfactual, and disease progression modeling.

### [574] [Skeleton-based Robust Registration Framework for Corrupted 3D Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24273)
*Yongqiang Wang,Weigang Li,Wenping Liu,Zhiqiang Tian,Jinling Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a skeleton-based robust registration framework (SRRF) for 3D point cloud registration, handling challenges like noise, density distortions, and geometric deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud registration faces challenges such as sensor and environmental noise, density distortions, and preprocessing errors that hinder alignment accuracy. Current methods are susceptible to these issues.

Method: A framework using skeletal structures and a distribution distance loss function is developed to align corrupted point clouds, enhancing global stability and resilience to corruption.

Result: Experimental evaluations demonstrate SRRF's superiority over state-of-the-art methods under various corruption scenarios, ensuring robust registration performance.

Conclusion: SRRF effectively handles corrupted point clouds, improving registration accuracy and robustness, positioning it as a promising solution for 3D perception tasks.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is fundamental in 3D vision applications, including
autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging, where precise alignment of
multiple point clouds is essential for accurate environment reconstruction.
However, real-world point clouds are often affected by sensor limitations,
environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging
due to density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations.
Existing registration methods rely on direct point matching or surface feature
extraction, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions and lead to
reduced alignment accuracy. To address these challenges, a skeleton-based
robust registration framework is presented, which introduces a
corruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness
and accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the
registration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the
corrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal
registration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to
enforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which
significantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures
that the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the
global stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate
registration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets
demonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration
methods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions,
noise contamination, and geometric deformations. The results confirm the
robustness of SRRF in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential
approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.

### [575] [Robust Partial 3D Point Cloud Registration via Confidence Estimation under Global Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24275)
*Yongqiang Wang,Weigang Li,Wenping Liu,Zhe Xu,Zhiqiang Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework called Confidence Estimation under Global Context (CEGC) is proposed for robust partial 3D point cloud registration, improving alignment accuracy in challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial point cloud registration faces challenges like structural ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise, necessitating more robust and effective methods.

Method: CEGC jointly models overlap confidence and correspondence reliability using a hybrid overlap confidence estimation module and a context-aware matching strategy. It utilizes soft confidence scores within a global context and computes transformations through a weighted SVD solver.

Result: CEGC demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in accuracy, robustness, and generalization on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes datasets.

Conclusion: CEGC provides an interpretable and scalable solution for partial point cloud registration, effectively handling complex conditions.

Abstract: Partial point cloud registration is essential for autonomous perception and
3D scene understanding, yet it remains challenging owing to structural
ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise. We address these issues by proposing
Confidence Estimation under Global Context (CEGC), a unified, confidence-driven
framework for robust partial 3D registration. CEGC enables accurate alignment
in complex scenes by jointly modeling overlap confidence and correspondence
reliability within a shared global context. Specifically, the hybrid overlap
confidence estimation module integrates semantic descriptors and geometric
similarity to detect overlapping regions and suppress outliers early. The
context-aware matching strategy smitigates ambiguity by employing global
attention to assign soft confidence scores to correspondences, improving
robustness. These scores guide a differentiable weighted singular value
decomposition solver to compute precise transformations. This tightly coupled
pipeline adaptively down-weights uncertain regions and emphasizes contextually
reliable matches. Experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes 3D
vision datasets demonstrate that CEGC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Overall, CEGC offers an interpretable
and scalable solution to partial point cloud registration under challenging
conditions.

*Sai Raj Kishore Perla,Aditya Vora,Sauradip Nag,Ali Mahdavi-Amiri,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASIA is a framework for controllable 3D segmentation using minimal user inputs, leveraging text-to-image diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable 3D segmentation from minimal and accessible annotations, overcoming limitations of text and 3D-specific inputs.

Method: Combines user-annotated image segments, Stable Diffusion priors, cross-view correspondence loss, UV-space voting, and Noise Optimization for accurate segmentation.

Result: Demonstrates superior segmentation performance quantitatively and qualitatively, capable of handling semantic and non-semantic tasks.

Conclusion: ASIA enables practical and generalizable 3D segmentation, improving upon prior methods using innovative techniques and accessible inputs.

Abstract: We introduce ASIA (Adaptive 3D Segmentation using few Image Annotations), a
novel framework that enables segmentation of possibly non-semantic and
non-text-describable "parts" in 3D. Our segmentation is controllable through a
few user-annotated in-the-wild images, which are easier to collect than
multi-view images, less demanding to annotate than 3D models, and more precise
than potentially ambiguous text descriptions. Our method leverages the rich
priors of text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), to
transfer segmentations from image space to 3D, even when the annotated and
target objects differ significantly in geometry or structure. During training,
we optimize a text token for each segment and fine-tune our model with a novel
cross-view part correspondence loss. At inference, we segment multi-view
renderings of the 3D mesh, fuse the labels in UV-space via voting, refine them
with our novel Noise Optimization technique, and finally map the UV-labels back
onto the mesh. ASIA provides a practical and generalizable solution for both
semantic and non-semantic 3D segmentation tasks, outperforming existing methods
by a noticeable margin in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

*Hanqi Chen,Zhongyin Zhao,Ye Chen,Zhujin Liang,Bingbing Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SVGThinker, a framework that utilizes large language models to significantly improve text-to-SVG generation, ensuring better alignment with instructions and higher quality outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to text-to-SVG generation suffer from weak generalization and poor adherence to user inputs, limiting their effectiveness for real-world applications.

Method: SVGThinker uses a reasoning-driven framework that sequentially renders SVG primitives and employs a multimodal model for annotation. A supervised fine-tuning process exposes the model's reasoning steps, reducing errors and hallucinations.

Result: SVGThinker demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, producing stable, editable, and high-quality SVGs that retain vector graphics' structural advantages.

Conclusion: SVGThinker paves the way for advanced applications in vector graphics by enabling precise, hierarchical edits and delivering outputs better suited for design and content creation.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a code-based representation for 2D visuals.
Leveraging recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we study
text-to-SVG generation and address two persistent gaps: weak generalization and
poor adherence to input instructions. We present SVGThinker, a reasoning-driven
framework that aligns the production of SVG code with the visualization process
and supports the full set of SVG primitives. Our pipeline first renders each
primitive in sequence and uses a multimodal model to annotate the image and
code; we then build stepwise updates that mirror the incremental addition of
primitives. On this data, we train an LLM with supervised fine-tuning that
exposes its chain-of-thought as intermediate reasoning, improving robustness
and reducing errors and hallucinations. Experiments against state-of-the-art
baselines show that SVGThinker produces more stable, editable, and
higher-quality SVGs while preserving the structural advantages of vector
graphics. Unlike image-based methods, our outputs enable precise and
hierarchical editing, opening new directions for design, content creation, and
automated graphics generation.

*Zefeng He,Xiaoye Qu,Yafu Li,Siyuan Huang,Daizong Liu,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FrameThinker, a framework to improve long video reasoning in LVLMs by leveraging iterative video interrogation, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning (RL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning in LVLMs, which hinder their effectiveness in visually intensive video understanding tasks.

Method: The authors propose FrameThinker, which equips LVLMs with iterative video interrogation capabilities. A two-phase training strategy is employed: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for fundamental actions and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to design and optimize reward-driven decisions.

Result: Experiments on multiple benchmarks show FrameThinker achieves an average improvement of +10.4% over baselines, with significant frame processing efficiency. Specifically, it reaches 76.1% accuracy on LongVideo-Reason using only 20.6 frames.

Conclusion: FrameThinker demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in long video reasoning, showcasing the model's effectiveness and efficiency in drastically reducing frame usage while enhancing accuracy.

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress
in video understanding, their application to long video reasoning is hindered
by uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inefficient
and struggle to handle visually intensive video tasks. To overcome these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce the concept of thinking with long
videos and propose a novel framework FrameThinker. Within this framework, LVLMs
are able to iteratively interrogate video content. Developing such video
reasoning capabilities in LVLMs presents notable challenges, particularly in
adapting the model to new video actions (e.g. select frame), and designing
reward functions to guide LVLMs to adopt the newly introduced action. To solve
these challenges, we propose a two-phase training strategy, first employing
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to instill fundamental action capabilities,
followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a strategic decision-making
policy.Notably, in this RL phase, we conduct an in-depth and comprehensive
exploration of the reward design for each action and format reward. Extensive
experiments on reasoning benchmarks like Video-Holmes, LongVideo-Reason, and
long-video understanding benchmarks such as LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoMME, and
LVBench, demonstrate that FrameThinker achieves a significant average
improvement of +10.4% over baselines while drastically reducing the number of
processed frames. Most notably, our 7B model, FrameThinker establishes a new
state-of-the-art on LongVideo-Reason, achieving 76.1% accuracy using an average
of only 20.6 frames. This not only outperforms the competitive LongVILA-R1
(72.0%) but does so with over 20x fewer frames (vs. 512), demonstrating
unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness.

*Yuhang Cao,Haojun Yan,Danya Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OMeGa is a system that improves indoor geometry reconstruction using a novel framework combining triangle meshes and Gaussian splats, achieving better accuracy and addressing prior limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations in novel view synthesis methods, specifically inaccurate reconstruction in texture-less indoor regions and lack of mesh integration during optimization.

Method: Introduces a joint optimization framework combining explicit triangle meshes and 2D Gaussian splats, with geometry learning enhanced via mesh constraints, monocular normal supervision, and iterative mesh-refinement strategies.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on indoor benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-$L_1$ by 47.3% compared to the 2DGS baseline, with competitive rendering quality.

Conclusion: OMeGa effectively overcomes challenges in prior methods, delivering accurate indoor reconstructions and improving geometric learning.

Abstract: Neural rendering with Gaussian splatting has advanced novel view synthesis,
and most methods reconstruct surfaces via post-hoc mesh extraction. However,
existing methods suffer from two limitations: (i) inaccurate geometry in
texture-less indoor regions, and (ii) the decoupling of mesh extraction from
optimization, thereby missing the opportunity to leverage mesh geometry to
guide splat optimization. In this paper, we present OMeGa, an end-to-end
framework that jointly optimizes an explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian
splats via a flexible binding strategy, where spatial attributes of Gaussian
Splats are expressed in the mesh frame and texture attributes are retained on
splats. To further improve reconstruction accuracy, we integrate mesh
constraints and monocular normal supervision into the optimization, thereby
regularizing geometry learning. In addition, we propose a heuristic, iterative
mesh-refinement strategy that splits high-error faces and prunes unreliable
ones to further improve the detail and accuracy of the reconstructed mesh.
OMeGa achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging indoor
reconstruction benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-$L_1$ by 47.3\% over the 2DGS
baseline while maintaining competitive novel-view rendering quality. The
experimental results demonstrate that OMeGa effectively addresses prior
limitations in indoor texture-less reconstruction.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates scalable and robust advancement in subtomogram analysis through innovative tools and strategies, paving the way for foundation models in cryo-ET.

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables in situ visualization of
macromolecular structures, where subtomogram analysis tasks such as
classification, alignment, and averaging are critical for structural
determination. However, effective analysis is hindered by scarce annotations,
severe noise, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we take the
first step towards foundation models for cryo-ET subtomograms. First, we
introduce CryoEngine, a large-scale synthetic data generator that produces over
904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes for pretraining. Second, we design
an Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT), which
incorporates adaptive phase tokenization as an equivariance-enhancing module
that improves robustness to both geometric and semantic variations. Third, we
introduce a Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy to stabilize
representation learning under severe noise conditions. Evaluations across 24
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on
all three major subtomogram tasks and strong generalization to unseen datasets,
advancing scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address limitations in semantic correspondence methods: traditional feature-metric approaches fail to capture complex relationships, while recent correlation-metric methods are computationally expensive.

Method: MambaMatcher employs selective state-space models (SSMs) with a similarity-aware scan mechanism derived from Mamba's linear-complexity algorithm, refining 4D correlation maps without losing resolution or receptive field.

Result: Experiments on semantic correspondence benchmarks show that MambaMatcher delivers state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: By introducing an efficient modeling mechanism for high-dimensional correlations, MambaMatcher successfully tackles computational and representational challenges, advancing the field of semantic image correspondence.

Abstract: Establishing semantic correspondences between images is a fundamental yet
challenging task in computer vision. Traditional feature-metric methods enhance
visual features but may miss complex inter-correlation relationships, while
recent correlation-metric approaches are hindered by high computational costs
due to processing 4D correlation maps. We introduce MambaMatcher, a novel
method that overcomes these limitations by efficiently modeling
high-dimensional correlations using selective state-space models (SSMs). By
implementing a similarity-aware selective scan mechanism adapted from Mamba's
linear-complexity algorithm, MambaMatcher refines the 4D correlation map
effectively without compromising feature map resolution or receptive field.
Experiments on standard semantic correspondence benchmarks demonstrate that
MambaMatcher achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method for accurate chicken counting in crowded farming scenarios using a tri-plane-based multi-view model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate counting of animals, like chickens, is challenging in crowded scenes due to factors like occlusion and limited camera viewpoints.

Method: The method uses a tri-plane geometric projection and fusion to align and integrate features from different camera views into a unified ground plane. A scene-level density map is decoded for counting.

Result: The proposed TP-MVCC model achieves 95.1% accuracy, outperforming single-view and conventional fusion methods, and exhibiting strong robustness in dense, occluded scenarios.

Conclusion: TP-MVCC shows practical potential for intelligent farming, addressing real challenges in crowded animal scenes with improved accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Accurate animal counting is essential for smart farming but remains difficult
in crowded scenes due to occlusions and limited camera views. To address this,
we propose a tri-plane-based multi-view chicken counting model (TP-MVCC), which
leverages geometric projection and tri-plane fusion to integrate features from
multiple cameras onto a unified ground plane. The framework extracts
single-view features, aligns them via spatial transformation, and decodes a
scene-level density map for precise chicken counting. In addition, we construct
the first multi-view dataset of silkie chickens under real farming conditions.
Experiments show that TP-MVCC significantly outperforms single-view and
conventional fusion comparisons, achieving 95.1\% accuracy and strong
robustness in dense, occluded scenarios, demonstrating its practical potential
for intelligent agriculture.

*Guolin Ke,Hui Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents SphereAR, a novel autoregressive (AR) model with hyperspherical constraints to stabilize image generation, achieving state-of-the-art FID scores on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models for image generation struggle with variance collapse, particularly under classifier-free guidance (CFG), due to heterogeneous variance in VAE latents.

Method: SphereAR introduces hyperspherical constraints by ensuring AR inputs and outputs lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere. This design is supported by hyperspherical VAEs and aims to eliminate scale components that lead to instability.

Result: SphereAR sets a new benchmark on ImageNet generation, achieving an FID score of 1.34 for its largest model while smaller models also outperform larger competitors.

Conclusion: SphereAR stabilizes AR decoding and showcases a breakthrough in AR image generation, surpassing existing diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable scales.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models are promising for image generation, yet
continuous-token AR variants often trail latent diffusion and masked-generation
models. The core issue is heterogeneous variance in VAE latents, which is
amplified during AR decoding, especially under classifier-free guidance (CFG),
and can cause variance collapse. We propose SphereAR to address this issue. Its
core design is to constrain all AR inputs and outputs -- including after CFG --
to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere (constant $\ell_2$ norm), leveraging
hyperspherical VAEs. Our theoretical analysis shows that hyperspherical
constraint removes the scale component (the primary cause of variance
collapse), thereby stabilizing AR decoding. Empirically, on ImageNet
generation, SphereAR-H (943M) sets a new state of the art for AR models,
achieving FID 1.34. Even at smaller scales, SphereAR-L (479M) reaches FID 1.54
and SphereAR-B (208M) reaches 1.92, matching or surpassing much larger
baselines such as MAR-H (943M, 1.55) and VAR-d30 (2B, 1.92). To our knowledge,
this is the first time a pure next-token AR image generator with raster order
surpasses diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable parameter
scales.

*Yan Ke,Xin Yu,Heming Du,Scott Chapman,Helen Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework for agricultural visual question answering (QA) tailored for real-world scenarios involving multi-image inputs, complementing views across scales/stages, and mitigating rigid pipelines and incomplete evidence issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agricultural QA methods are limited to evidence-constrained setups (e.g., text-only or single-image inputs) and struggle to perform under real-world conditions such as multi-image comparisons, incomplete evidence, and lack systematic quality control.

Method: The authors introduce a self-reflective, self-improving multi-agent framework comprising roles—Retriever, Reflector, Answerers, and Improver—each designed to handle specific QA tasks like query formulation, assessment, answer drafting, refinement, and ensuring alignment across multi-image data.

Result: Experimental results using the AgMMU benchmark demonstrate the proposed framework's competitive performance in multi-image agricultural QA scenarios, showcasing effective reasoning and iterative improvements.

Conclusion: The multi-agent framework addresses current limitations in agricultural QA systems by leveraging collaboration and iterative processes to enhance answer quality, contextual enrichment, and adaptability to complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Agricultural visual question answering is essential for providing farmers and
researchers with accurate and timely knowledge. However, many existing
approaches are predominantly developed for evidence-constrained settings such
as text-only queries or single-image cases. This design prevents them from
coping with real-world agricultural scenarios that often require multi-image
inputs with complementary views across spatial scales, and growth stages.
Moreover, limited access to up-to-date external agricultural context makes
these systems struggle to adapt when evidence is incomplete. In addition, rigid
pipelines often lack systematic quality control. To address this gap, we
propose a self-reflective and self-improving multi-agent framework that
integrates four roles, the Retriever, the Reflector, the Answerer, and the
Improver. They collaborate to enable context enrichment, reflective reasoning,
answer drafting, and iterative improvement.
  A Retriever formulates queries and gathers external information, while a
Reflector assesses adequacy and triggers sequential reformulation and renewed
retrieval. Two Answerers draft candidate responses in parallel to reduce bias.
The Improver refines them through iterative checks while ensuring that
information from multiple images is effectively aligned and utilized.
Experiments on the AgMMU benchmark show that our framework achieves competitive
performance on multi-image agricultural QA.

*Yixuan Ren,Hanyu Wang,Hao Chen,Bo He,Abhinav Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeRV-Diffusion, a framework utilizing implicit latent video diffusion by synthesizing neural network weights for video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and complexities in traditional video generation methods, especially the reliance on frame-wise feature map encoding.

Method: The approach involves two stages: encoding raw videos into neural parameter space via a hypernetwork-based tokenizer, and using an implicit diffusion transformer to denoise latent INR weights for holistic video synthesis.

Result: NeRV-Diffusion achieves high-quality video synthesis surpassing prior INR-based models and is competitive with state-of-the-art non-implicit methods on datasets like UCF-101 and Kinetics-600.

Conclusion: The model provides an efficient approach to video generation with smooth interpolation capabilities and eliminates the need for complex cross-frame attentions.

Abstract: We present NeRV-Diffusion, an implicit latent video diffusion model that
synthesizes videos via generating neural network weights. The generated weights
can be rearranged as the parameters of a convolutional neural network, which
forms an implicit neural representation (INR), and decodes into videos with
frame indices as the input. Our framework consists of two stages: 1) A
hypernetworkbased tokenizer that encodes raw videos from pixel space to neural
parameter space, where the bottleneck latent serves as INR weights to decode.
2) An implicit diffusion transformer that denoises on the latent INR weights.
In contrast to traditional video tokenizers that encode videos into frame-wise
feature maps, NeRV-Diffusion compresses and generates a video holistically as a
unified neural network. This enables efficient and high-quality video synthesis
via obviating temporal cross-frame attentions in the denoiser and decoding
video latent with dedicated decoders. To achieve Gaussian-distributed INR
weights with high expressiveness, we reuse the bottleneck latent across all
NeRV layers, as well as reform its weight assignment, upsampling connection and
input coordinates. We also introduce SNR-adaptive loss weighting and scheduled
sampling for effective training of the implicit diffusion model. NeRV-Diffusion
reaches superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and
comparable performance to most recent state-of-the-art non-implicit models on
real-world video benchmarks including UCF-101 and Kinetics-600. It also brings
a smooth INR weight space that facilitates seamless interpolations between
frames or videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LamFormer is a proposed deep-learning network for multi-organ medical image segmentation that balances performance and complexity using specialized modules for feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of segmentation methods for multi-organ medical images, addressing high computational costs and deficiencies in capturing local details.

Method: The paper introduces LamFormer, a U-shaped network that integrates Linear Attention Mamba, Parallel Hierarchical Feature Aggregation, and Reduced Transformer modules.

Result: LamFormer outperforms existing methods on seven complex datasets by achieving superior segmentation accuracy and balancing computational complexity.

Conclusion: LamFormer achieves excellent performance for multi-organ segmentation tasks and resolves limitations of prior methods concerning computational overhead and local feature extraction.

Abstract: In the field of multi-organ medical image segmentation, recent methods
frequently employ Transformers to capture long-range dependencies from image
features. However, these methods overlook the high computational cost of
Transformers and their deficiencies in extracting local detailed information.
To address high computational costs and inadequate local detail information, we
reassess the design of feature extraction modules and propose a new
deep-learning network called LamFormer for fine-grained segmentation tasks
across multiple organs. LamFormer is a novel U-shaped network that employs
Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) in an enhanced pyramid encoder to capture
multi-scale long-range dependencies. We construct the Parallel Hierarchical
Feature Aggregation (PHFA) module to aggregate features from different layers
of the encoder, narrowing the semantic gap among features while filtering
information. Finally, we design the Reduced Transformer (RT), which utilizes a
distinct computational approach to globally model up-sampled features. RRT
enhances the extraction of detailed local information and improves the
network's capability to capture long-range dependencies. LamFormer outperforms
existing segmentation methods on seven complex and diverse datasets,
demonstrating exceptional performance. Moreover, the proposed network achieves
a balance between model performance and model complexity.

### [587] [DRIFT: Divergent Response in Filtered Transformations for Robust Adversarial Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24359)
*Amira Guesmi,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces and evaluates DRIFT, a defense mechanism for deep neural networks against adversarial attacks, leveraging the concept of 'gradient dissonance' to disrupt adversarial transferability and achieve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, and existing defenses often fail when gradients are reliably estimated. This paper aims to address the mechanism of 'gradient consensus,' which attackers exploit to create transferable adversarial examples.

Method: The proposed method, DRIFT, uses a stochastic ensemble of lightweight, learnable filters that disrupt gradient consensus through 'gradient dissonance.' DRIFT maximizes divergences in Jacobian- and logit-space responses while ensuring predictions remain accurate for natural inputs.

Result: DRIFT achieves significant gains in robustness tested against various attack types (adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and gradient-free) across datasets like ImageNet and architectures including CNNs and Vision Transformers. It surpasses state-of-the-art defenses with minimal computational costs.

Conclusion: DRIFT establishes 'gradient divergence' as a practical and generalizable approach for adversarial defense, offering robust protection against multiple types of attacks while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, and
most defenses collapse once gradients can be reliably estimated. We identify
\emph{gradient consensus} -- the tendency of randomized transformations to
yield aligned gradients -- as a key driver of adversarial transferability.
Attackers exploit this consensus to construct perturbations that remain
effective across transformations. We introduce \textbf{DRIFT} (Divergent
Response in Filtered Transformations), a stochastic ensemble of lightweight,
learnable filters trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus. Unlike prior
randomized defenses that rely on gradient masking, DRIFT enforces
\emph{gradient dissonance} by maximizing divergence in Jacobian- and
logit-space responses while preserving natural predictions. Our contributions
are threefold: (i) we formalize gradient consensus and provide a theoretical
analysis linking consensus to transferability; (ii) we propose a
consensus-divergence training strategy combining prediction consistency,
Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness; and

*Hao Yang,Weijie Qiu,Ru Zhang,Zhou Fang,Ruichao Mao,Xiaoyu Lin,Maji Huang,Zhaosong Huang,Teng Guo,Shuoyang Liu,Hai Rao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UI-UG, a unified MLLM model combining UI understanding and generation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance at reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often struggle with domain-specific tasks like UI understanding and generation. This paper aims to address these challenges in the UI domain.

Method: The approach combines Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and GRPO for UI understanding and uses Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for UI generation. It also introduces a domain-specific language, training strategies, and an evaluation framework.

Result: Experiments show UI-UG achieves superior accuracy in UI understanding and competitive performance in UI generation compared to larger MLLMs, while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: UI-UG's unified design improves performance on both UI understanding and generation tasks, establishing a benchmark for domain-specific MLLM applications.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied
across domains, they are still facing challenges in domain-specific tasks, such
as User Interface (UI) understanding accuracy and UI generation quality. In
this paper, we introduce UI-UG (a unified MLLM for UI Understanding and
Generation), integrating both capabilities. For understanding tasks, we employ
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to enhance fine-grained understanding on the modern complex UI data. For
generation tasks, we further use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to make
our model generate human-preferred UIs. In addition, we propose an industrially
effective workflow, including the design of an LLM-friendly domain-specific
language (DSL), training strategies, rendering processes, and evaluation
metrics. In experiments, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
on understanding tasks, outperforming both larger general-purpose MLLMs and
similarly-sized UI-specialized models. Our model is also on par with these
larger MLLMs in UI generation performance at a fraction of the computational
cost. We also demonstrate that integrating understanding and generation tasks
can improve accuracy and quality for both tasks.

*Jitai Hao,Hao Liu,Xinyan Xiao,Qiang Huang,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Uni-X, an X-shaped architecture addressing gradient conflicts in unified multimodal models through modality-specific processing at the ends and shared parameters in the middle, achieving better training efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to address the gradient conflict issues in shared autoregressive transformers for unified multimodal models, which arise due to the distinct statistical properties of vision and text modalities.

Method: The paper proposes Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture. It dedicates the initial and final layers of the network to modality-specific processing, while sharing middle layers for semantic fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments show that Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency compared to baseline models. When scaled to 3B parameters, it matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs in performance, with a GenEval score of 82 for image generation and strong results in multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: Uni-X is a parameter-efficient and scalable solution that overcomes gradient conflict challenges in unified multimodal modeling and establishes a strong foundation for future developments in the field.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) built on shared autoregressive (AR)
transformers are attractive for their architectural simplicity. However, we
identify a critical limitation: when trained on multimodal inputs,
modality-shared transformers suffer from severe gradient conflicts between
vision and text, particularly in shallow and deep layers. We trace this issue
to the fundamentally different low-level statistical properties of images and
text, while noting that conflicts diminish in middle layers where
representations become more abstract and semantically aligned. To overcome this
challenge, we propose Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture.
Uni-X dedicates its initial and final layers to modality-specific processing,
while maintaining shared parameters in the middle layers for high-level
semantic fusion. This X-shaped design not only eliminates gradient conflicts at
both ends but also further alleviates residual conflicts in the shared layers.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Uni-X. Under identical
training conditions, Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency compared to
strong baselines. When scaled to 3B parameters with larger training data, Uni-X
matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs, achieving a GenEval score of 82 for
image generation alongside strong performance in text and vision understanding
tasks. These results establish Uni-X as a parameter-efficient and scalable
foundation for future unified multimodal modeling. Our code is available at

### [590] [Real-Aware Residual Model Merging for Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24367)
*Jinhee Park,Guisik Kim,Choongsang Cho,Junseok Kwon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deepfake detection benefits from model merging to handle evolving data, with a novel training-free method (R$^2$M) that preserves Real representations while enhancing Fake-specific cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the impracticality of exhaustive retraining for deepfake detection due to rapidly evolving deepfake generators.

Method: Proposed a training-free parameter merging method called Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R$^2$M), leveraging weight averaging and low-rank factorization of task vectors.

Result: R$^2$M outperformed joint training and other merging approaches across multiple datasets, including unseen data.

Conclusion: R$^2$M provides a sustainable and composable solution for deepfake detection without repeated retraining.

Abstract: Deepfake generators evolve quickly, making exhaustive data collection and
repeated retraining impractical. We argue that model merging is a natural fit
for deepfake detection: unlike generic multi-task settings with disjoint
labels, deepfake specialists share the same binary decision and differ in
generator-specific artifacts. Empirically, we show that simple weight averaging
preserves Real representations while attenuating Fake-specific cues. Building
upon these findings, we propose Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R$^2$M), a
training-free parameter-space merging framework. R$^2$M estimates a shared Real
component via a low-rank factorization of task vectors, decomposes each
specialist into a Real-aligned part and a Fake residual, denoises residuals
with layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching
to prevent any single generator from dominating. A concise rationale explains
why a simple head suffices: the Real component induces a common separation
direction in feature space, while truncated residuals contribute only minor
off-axis variations. Across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset,
R$^2$M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines. Importantly,
R$^2$M is also composable: when a new forgery family appears, we fine-tune one
specialist and re-merge, eliminating the need for retraining.

*Khawlah Bajbaa,Abbas Anwar,Muhammad Saqib,Hafeez Anwar,Nabin Sharma,Muhammad Usman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid framework combining diffusion-based models and GANs to generate geographically consistent street-view images from satellite data, showcasing improved image realism and geometry preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in synthesizing visually and geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery, given their significant differences in viewpoint and appearance.

Method: The proposed method uses a multi-stage structure leveraging Stable Diffusion in a dual-branch setup, combined with conditional GANs, and incorporates a fusion strategy to enhance both geometric consistency and image quality.

Result: The framework is tested on the CVUSA dataset, outperforming diffusion-only models and competing effectively against advanced GAN-based approaches, while preserving detailed street and environmental elements.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework successfully bridges the satellite-to-street-view domain gap, demonstrating its utility for realistic and geographically consistent street-view imagery synthesis.

Abstract: Street view imagery has become an essential source for geospatial data
collection and urban analytics, enabling the extraction of valuable insights
that support informed decision-making. However, synthesizing street-view images
from corresponding satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to
substantial differences in appearance and viewing perspective between these two
domains. This paper presents a hybrid framework that integrates diffusion-based
models and conditional generative adversarial networks to generate
geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery. Our
approach uses a multi-stage training strategy that incorporates Stable
Diffusion as the core component within a dual-branch architecture. To enhance
the framework's capabilities, we integrate a conditional Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) that enables the generation of geographically consistent
panoramic street views. Furthermore, we implement a fusion strategy that
leverages the strengths of both models to create robust representations,
thereby improving the geometric consistency and visual quality of the generated
street-view images. The proposed framework is evaluated on the challenging
Cross-View USA (CVUSA) dataset, a standard benchmark for cross-view image
synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach
outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple evaluation metrics and
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GAN-based
methods. The framework successfully generates realistic and geometrically
consistent street-view images while preserving fine-grained local details,
including street markings, secondary roads, and atmospheric elements such as
clouds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DINOReg, a network for point cloud registration that effectively combines visual and geometric features for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing point cloud registration methods that underutilize texture and semantic information from images and perform feature fusion in a lossy manner.

Method: The method employs DINOv2 to extract rich visual features and combines them with detailed geometric features at a patch level. A mixed positional embedding is introduced to enhance spatial relationship perception.

Result: DINOReg achieves notable improvements on RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets, including a 14.2% higher patch inlier ratio and a 15.7% increase in registration recall compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DINOReg effectively integrates visual and geometric information, significantly advancing point cloud registration performance. The code is made publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision. Most
existing methods rely solely on geometric information for feature extraction
and matching. Recently, several studies have incorporated color information
from RGB-D data into feature extraction. Although these methods achieve
remarkable improvements, they have not fully exploited the abundant texture and
semantic information in images, and the feature fusion is performed in an
image-lossy manner, which limit their performance. In this paper, we propose
DINOReg, a registration network that sufficiently utilizes both visual and
geometric information to solve the point cloud registration problem. Inspired
by advances in vision foundation models, we employ DINOv2 to extract
informative visual features from images, and fuse visual and geometric features
at the patch level. This design effectively combines the rich texture and
global semantic information extracted by DINOv2 with the detailed geometric
structure information captured by the geometric backbone. Additionally, a mixed
positional embedding is proposed to encode positional information from both
image space and point cloud space, which enhances the model's ability to
perceive spatial relationships between patches. Extensive experiments on the
RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art geometry-only and multi-modal
registration methods, with a 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and a 15.7%
increase in registration recall. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE), which greatly enhances the efficiency of annotating submeter resolution imagery for land cover mapping, helping create the first city-level dataset called HiCity-LC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of utilizing submeter resolution imagery for large-scale land cover mapping due to insufficient high-quality annotated datasets.

Method: The authors propose the Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE), which organizes semantically consistent mask groups to enable efficient annotation of multiple instances using the spatial autocorrelation principle.

Result: MCAE significantly improves annotation efficiency by 1-2 orders of magnitude, achieving over 85% classification accuracy in generating city-scale land cover maps for five Chinese cities.

Conclusion: The MCAE method and resulting HiCity-LC dataset demonstrate the scalability and practicality of large-scale submeter resolution land cover mapping, setting a new benchmark by providing high-quality, accessible data.

Abstract: Recent advances in remote sensing technology have made submeter resolution
imagery increasingly accessible, offering remarkable detail for fine-grained
land cover analysis. However, its full potential remains underutilized -
particularly for large-scale land cover mapping - due to the lack of
sufficient, high-quality annotated datasets. Existing labels are typically
derived from pre-existing products or manual annotation, which are often
unreliable or prohibitively expensive, particularly given the rich visual
detail and massive data volumes of submeter imagery. Inspired by the spatial
autocorrelation principle, which suggests that objects of the same class tend
to co-occur with similar visual features in local neighborhoods, we propose the
Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE), which treats semantically
consistent mask groups as the minimal annotating units to enable efficient,
simultaneous annotation of multiple instances. It significantly improves
annotation efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude, while preserving label
quality, semantic diversity, and spatial representativeness. With MCAE, we
build a high-quality annotated dataset of about 14 billion labeled pixels,
referred to as HiCity-LC, which supports the generation of city-scale land
cover maps across five major Chinese cities with classification accuracies
above 85%. It is the first publicly available submeter resolution city-level
land cover benchmark, highlighting the scalability and practical utility of
MCAE for large-scale, submeter resolution mapping. The dataset is available at

*Soumyadeep Chandra,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces REALIGN, a self-supervised framework for learning from instructional videos that addresses challenges like irrelevant frames and out-of-order steps, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of background noise, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders in procedural instructional videos, which violate the assumptions of traditional alignment methods.

Method: REALIGN uses Regularized Fused Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT) to model visual correspondences and temporal relations. It incorporates inter-sequence contrastive learning to stabilize training and avoid degeneracies.

Result: REALIGN shows significant improvements in performance, with up to 18.9% F1-score gains and over 30% temporal IoU enhancements on instructional video benchmarks, while providing interpretable transport maps.

Conclusion: REALIGN advances procedural video learning by robustly handling real-world variabilities and out-of-order steps, achieving superior results over state-of-the-art methods and proving its practicality.

Abstract: Learning from procedural videos remains a core challenge in self-supervised
representation learning, as real-world instructional data often contains
background segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order. Such
variability violates the strong monotonicity assumptions underlying many
alignment methods. Prior state-of-the-art approaches, such as OPEL, leverage
Kantorovich Optimal Transport (KOT) to build frame-to-frame correspondences,
but rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture the higher-order
temporal structure of a task. In this paper, we introduce REALIGN, a
self-supervised framework for procedure learning based on Regularized Fused
Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT). In contrast to KOT,
our formulation jointly models visual correspondences and temporal relations
under a partial alignment scheme, enabling robust handling of irrelevant
frames, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders common in instructional
videos. To stabilize training, we integrate FPGWOT distances with
inter-sequence contrastive learning, avoiding the need for multiple
regularizers and preventing collapse to degenerate solutions. Across egocentric
(EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, REALIGN achieves
up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains,
while producing more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step
orderings and filter out noise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vid-LLM is a novel video-based 3D Multimodal Large Language Model (3D-MLLM) that eliminates the reliance on external 3D data inputs and shows effectiveness in tasks like 3D Question Answering, Dense Captioning, and Visual Grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D-MLLMs rely heavily on external 3D data inputs, limiting their scalability and capability to generalize to real-world scenarios.

Method: Vid-LLM leverages video inputs and integrates geometric priors efficiently through a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) and a Metric Depth Model to maintain geometric consistency. The model is optimized through a two-stage distillation strategy for fast and stable training.

Result: The model achieved strong performance across various benchmarks for 3D-related tasks, verifying its multi-task capabilities.

Conclusion: Vid-LLM bridges the gap in 3D scene understanding without dependence on 3D data, enabling scalable and effective deployment for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent developments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved Vision-Language (VL) reasoning in 2D domains. However,
extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major
challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend
on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this
limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes
video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for
real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to
improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric
cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to
align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To
ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model
that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the
model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy,
realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments
across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D
Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks,
demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.

*Junyi Gu,Beatriz Cabrero-Daniel,Ali Nouri,Lydia Armini,Christian Berger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PCICF, a framework for systematically identifying and classifying pedestrian situations to aid in analyzing operational design domains for robotaxis. The proposed approach is tested using real-world and synthetic data, showing its effectiveness and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in improving the safety and reliability of robotaxis in urban areas by enabling them to handle complex scenarios involving vulnerable road users, such as groups of pedestrians, using systematic and computationally efficient methods.

Method: The authors developed PCICF, which transforms multi-dimensional scenario data into patterns using space-filling curves (SFCs) and matches these patterns with a structured dataset (MoreSMIRK) that includes various complex pedestrian crossing situations.

Result: PCICF successfully identifies and classifies complex pedestrian crossings even in intricate situations, like merging or splitting groups of pedestrians, and demonstrates potential for onboard use in robotaxis for real-time detection.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that PCICF, enhanced with computationally efficient components, is a valuable tool for analyzing and detecting out-of-distribution scenarios in robotaxis' operational environments. The open-source replication package ensures reproducibility and broader usage.

Abstract: We have recently observed the commercial roll-out of robotaxis in various
countries. They are deployed within an operational design domain (ODD) on
specific routes and environmental conditions, and are subject to continuous
monitoring to regain control in safety-critical situations. Since ODDs
typically cover urban areas, robotaxis must reliably detect vulnerable road
users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, bicyclists, or e-scooter riders. To better
handle such varied traffic situations, end-to-end AI, which directly compute
vehicle control actions from multi-modal sensor data instead of only for
perception, is on the rise. High quality data is needed for systematically
training and evaluating such systems within their OOD. In this work, we propose
PCICF, a framework to systematically identify and classify VRU situations to
support ODD's incident analysis. We base our work on the existing synthetic
dataset SMIRK, and enhance it by extending its single-pedestrian-only design
into the MoreSMIRK dataset, a structured dictionary of multi-pedestrian
crossing situations constructed systematically. We then use space-filling
curves (SFCs) to transform multi-dimensional features of scenarios into
characteristic patterns, which we match with corresponding entries in
MoreSMIRK. We evaluate PCICF with the large real-world dataset PIE, which
contains more than 150 manually annotated pedestrian crossing videos. We show
that PCICF can successfully identify and classify complex pedestrian crossings,
even when groups of pedestrians merge or split. By leveraging computationally
efficient components like SFCs, PCICF has even potential to be used onboard of
robotaxis for OOD detection for example. We share an open-source replication
package for PCICF containing its algorithms, the complete MoreSMIRK dataset and
dictionary, as well as our experiment results presented in:

Conclusion: RapidMV effectively bridges text prompts and multi-view image generation with high speed and improved quality.

Abstract: Generating synthetic multi-view images from a text prompt is an essential
bridge to generating synthetic 3D assets. In this work, we introduce RapidMV, a
novel text-to-multi-view generative model that can produce 32 multi-view
synthetic images in just around 5 seconds. In essence, we propose a novel
spatio-angular latent space, encoding both the spatial appearance and angular
viewpoint deviations into a single latent for improved efficiency and
multi-view consistency. We achieve effective training of RapidMV by
strategically decomposing our training process into multiple steps. We
demonstrate that RapidMV outperforms existing methods in terms of consistency
and latency, with competitive quality and text-image alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLQ, a method optimizing diffusion transformer model quantization for better deployment on edge devices, achieving significant memory savings and inference speedup with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) improve visual generation quality but make them unsuitable for edge devices due to increased model size and complexity.

Method: CLQ involves three innovations: cross-block calibration (CBC) for accurate activation representation, orthogonal-based smoothing (OBS) to address outliers, and cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS). These aim to improve post-training quantization (PTQ) efficiency.

Result: CLQ compressed models to W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual quality and metrics, achieving 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x inference speedup.

Conclusion: CLQ demonstrates effective post-training quantization suited for diffusion transformers, making them more applicable in resource-constrained environments without compromising quality.

Abstract: Visual generation quality has been greatly promoted with the rapid advances
in diffusion transformers (DiTs), which is attributed to the scaling of model
size and complexity. However, these attributions also hinder the practical
deployment of DiTs on edge devices, limiting their development and application.
Serve as an efficient model compression technique, model post-training
quantization (PTQ) can reduce the memory consumption and speed up the
inference, with inevitable performance degradation. To alleviate the
degradation, we propose CLQ, a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization
method for DiTs. To be specific, CLQ consists of three key designs. First, we
observe that the calibration data used by most of the PTQ methods can not
honestly represent the distribution of the activations. Therefore, we propose
cross-block calibration (CBC) to obtain accurate calibration data, with which
the quantization can be better guided. Second, we propose orthogonal-based
smoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and
leverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible
overhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search.
We evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and
successfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual
quality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup. Our
code is available at

*Pei-Han Chen,Szu-Chi Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes the significance of dataset quality over model refinement in machine learning, specifically in the image domain. It introduces a pipeline using tools CleanVision and Fastdup with enhanced mechanisms to detect and mitigate image data quality issues, presenting experimental results with improved metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical need for systematic evaluation and improvement of image dataset quality as model gains in machine learning diminish.

Method: Development of a pipeline integrating CleanVision and Fastdup, with enhancements like automatic threshold selection to identify problematic images. The authors evaluate this process using F1 score under various perturbations and conditions.

Result: Key findings reveal that not all image quality issues equally impact model performance. The developed pipeline significantly improves F1 scores in detecting low-quality images (single perturbation from 0.6794 to 0.9468, dual perturbation from 0.7447 to 0.8557) and near-duplicate detection (from 0.4576 to 0.7928).

Conclusion: Enhanced workflows for dataset quality assessment are effective in addressing critical image data issues, offering a robust foundation for improving the reliability and efficiency of image-based machine learning.

Abstract: In machine learning, research has traditionally focused on model development,
with relatively less attention paid to training data. As model architectures
have matured and marginal gains from further refinements diminish, data quality
has emerged as a critical factor. However, systematic studies on evaluating and
ensuring dataset quality in the image domain remain limited.
  This study investigates methods for systematically assessing image dataset
quality and examines how various image quality factors influence model
performance. Using the publicly available and relatively clean CIFAKE dataset,
we identify common quality issues and quantify their impact on training.
Building on these findings, we develop a pipeline that integrates two
community-developed tools, CleanVision and Fastdup. We analyze their underlying
mechanisms and introduce several enhancements, including automatic threshold
selection to detect problematic images without manual tuning.
  Experimental results demonstrate that not all quality issues exert the same
level of impact. While convolutional neural networks show resilience to certain
distortions, they are particularly vulnerable to degradations that obscure
critical visual features, such as blurring and severe downscaling. To assess
the performance of existing tools and the effectiveness of our proposed
enhancements, we formulate the detection of low-quality images as a binary
classification task and use the F1 score as the evaluation metric. Our
automatic thresholding method improves the F1 score from 0.6794 to 0.9468 under
single perturbations and from 0.7447 to 0.8557 under dual perturbations. For
near-duplicate detection, our deduplication strategy increases the F1 score
from 0.4576 to 0.7928. These results underscore the effectiveness of our
workflow and provide a foundation for advancing data quality assessment in
image-based machine learning.

*Yuanyuan Gao,Yuning Gong,Yifei Liu,Li Jingfeng,Zhihang Zhong,Dingwen Zhang,Yanci Zhang,Dan Xu,Xiao Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proxy-GS improves 3D Gaussian Splatting by incorporating occlusion awareness, enhancing rendering quality and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The redundancy in existing pruning strategies and level-of-detail techniques for 3D Gaussian Splatting without considering occlusion awareness limits rendering efficiency and quality.

Method: Proxy-GS employs a fast proxy system to generate occlusion depth maps and guide Gaussian culling and densification during rendering and training.

Result: Proxy-GS achieves over 2.5x speedup compared to Octree-GS while significantly improving rendering quality in occluded environments like MatrixCity Streets dataset.

Conclusion: Incorporating occlusion awareness through Proxy-GS significantly optimizes both performance and visual fidelity for photorealistic rendering.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for
achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve
visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering.
To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail
(LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number
of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals
that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion
awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a
proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of
our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion
depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles:
first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering
speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training,
avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering
quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset,

*Runmin Zhang,Jialiang Wang,Si-Yuan Cao,Zhu Yu,Junchen Yu,Guangyi Zhang,Hui-Liang Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCFlow introduces an innovative unsupervised cross-modal flow estimation framework utilizing decoupled optimization and consistency constraints, excelling in modality discrepancy and geometric misalignment handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches rely solely on appearance similarity for flow estimation, which struggles with modality discrepancies and geometric misalignments.

Method: DCFlow uses a decoupled optimization strategy with collaborative training of modality transfer and flow estimation networks, combined with geometry-aware data synthesis and outlier-robust loss.

Result: DCFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods, validated on a comprehensive cross-modal flow benchmark.

Conclusion: The framework can effectively address modality discrepancy and geometric misalignment, propelling cross-modal flow estimation forward.

Abstract: This work presents DCFlow, a novel unsupervised cross-modal flow estimation
framework that integrates a decoupled optimization strategy and a cross-modal
consistency constraint. Unlike previous approaches that implicitly learn flow
estimation solely from appearance similarity, we introduce a decoupled
optimization strategy with task-specific supervision to address modality
discrepancy and geometric misalignment distinctly. This is achieved by
collaboratively training a modality transfer network and a flow estimation
network. To enable reliable motion supervision without ground-truth flow, we
propose a geometry-aware data synthesis pipeline combined with an
outlier-robust loss. Additionally, we introduce a cross-modal consistency
constraint to jointly optimize both networks, significantly improving flow
prediction accuracy. For evaluation, we construct a comprehensive cross-modal
flow benchmark by repurposing public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
that DCFlow can be integrated with various flow estimation networks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches.

### [602] [UI2V-Bench: An Understanding-based Image-to-video Generation Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24427)
*Ailing Zhang,Lina Lei,Dehong Kong,Zhixin Wang,Jiaqi Xu,Fenglong Song,Chun-Le Guo,Chang Liu,Fan Li,Jie Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UI2V-Bench, a benchmark designed for evaluating image-to-video (I2V) generation models, emphasizing semantic understanding and reasoning rather than video quality alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for I2V generation focus predominantly on video quality and temporal consistency, neglecting semantic comprehension, alignment with physical laws, and commonsense reasoning.

Method: UI2V-Bench evaluates I2V models using four dimensions: spatial understanding, attribute binding, category understanding, and reasoning, employing MLLM-based pipelines for instance-level and causal evaluations paired with human assessments.

Result: Approximately 500 text-image pairs were utilized to benchmark various I2V models, and human evaluations validated the alignment with metrics established by the MLLM-based evaluation methods.

Conclusion: The benchmark addresses the critical gap in I2V evaluation by prioritizing semantic comprehension and reasoning, thus providing a robust framework for advancing research in video synthesis.

Abstract: Generative diffusion models are developing rapidly and attracting increasing
attention due to their wide range of applications. Image-to-Video (I2V)
generation has become a major focus in the field of video synthesis. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on aspects such as video quality
and temporal consistency, while largely overlooking the model's ability to
understand the semantics of specific subjects in the input image or to ensure
that the generated video aligns with physical laws and human commonsense. To
address this gap, we propose UI2V-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating I2V
models with a focus on semantic understanding and reasoning. It introduces four
primary evaluation dimensions: spatial understanding, attribute binding,
category understanding, and reasoning. To assess these dimensions, we design
two evaluation methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): an
instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding, and a
feedback-based reasoning pipeline that enables step-by-step causal assessment
for more accurate evaluation. UI2V-Bench includes approximately 500 carefully
constructed text-image pairs and evaluates a range of both open source and
closed-source I2V models across all defined dimensions. We further incorporate
human evaluations, which show strong alignment with the proposed MLLM-based
metrics. Overall, UI2V-Bench fills a critical gap in I2V evaluation by
emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning ability, offering a robust
framework and dataset to support future research and model development in the
field.

*Yanpeng Zhao,Shanyan Guan,Yunbo Wang,Yanhao Ge,Wei Li,Xiaokang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeoWorld is a deep learning framework for generating interactive 3D virtual worlds from a single image. It ensures high realism in actively explored regions using 3D representations, incorporating 2D synthesis for efficiency in unexplored areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to enhance virtual world generation by combining visual realism and efficiency, inspired by the dynamic worldbuilding concept in science fiction.

Method: The method involves a hybrid scene structure that uses state-of-the-art representation learning and object-to-3D techniques to model foreground objects in 3D and background regions in 2D, with features like language-based object control and progressive detail generation.

Result: NeoWorld achieves superior performance compared to existing 2D and 2.5D methods on the WorldScore benchmark, indicating better realism and user interaction.

Conclusion: This paper presents a cutting-edge system for dynamic and immersive virtual world creation, demonstrating superior capabilities for interactive and visually coherent environments.

Abstract: We introduce NeoWorld, a deep learning framework for generating interactive
3D virtual worlds from a single input image. Inspired by the on-demand
worldbuilding concept in the science fiction novel Simulacron-3 (1964), our
system constructs expansive environments where only the regions actively
explored by the user are rendered with high visual realism through
object-centric 3D representations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on
global world generation or 2D hallucination, NeoWorld models key foreground
objects in full 3D, while synthesizing backgrounds and non-interacted regions
in 2D to ensure efficiency. This hybrid scene structure, implemented with
cutting-edge representation learning and object-to-3D techniques, enables
flexible viewpoint manipulation and physically plausible scene animation,
allowing users to control object appearance and dynamics using natural language
commands. As users interact with the environment, the virtual world
progressively unfolds with increasing 3D detail, delivering a dynamic,
immersive, and visually coherent exploration experience. NeoWorld significantly
outperforms existing 2D and depth-layered 2.5D methods on the WorldScore
benchmark.

### [604] [Beyond Isolated Facts: Synthesizing Narrative and Grounded Supervision for VideoQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24445)
*Jianxin Liang,Tan Yue,Yuxuan Wang,Yueqian Wang,Zhihan Yin,Huishuai Zhang,Dongyan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to provide richer supervision for Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models by synthesizing narrative and evidential data, yielding significant accuracy gains and improved model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoQA models are limited by isolated question-answer pairs that fail to represent the narrative and causal structures of events in video content.

Method: The paper proposes two strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP) to generate narrative paragraphs summarizing video event structures, and Question-Based Captioning (QBC) to produce fine-grained visual rationales for questions. Both strategies leverage generative models to train VideoQA models under a unified next-token prediction objective.

Result: The method achieves significant accuracy improvements, setting new state-of-the-art results on STAR (72.5%, +4.9%) and NExT-QA (80.8%), while also improving cross-dataset generalization and reducing model convergence time by over 2.5x with QBP.

Conclusion: Synthesizing data that incorporates narrative coherence and grounded rationales enhances VideoQA model accuracy, efficiency, and generalization, paving the way for better training paradigms.

Abstract: The performance of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models is fundamentally
constrained by the nature of their supervision, which typically consists of
isolated, factual question-answer pairs. This "bag-of-facts" approach fails to
capture the underlying narrative and causal structure of events, limiting
models to a shallow understanding of video content. To move beyond this
paradigm, we introduce a framework to synthesize richer supervisory signals. We
propose two complementary strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP), which
synthesizes the diverse inquiries (what, how, why) from a video's existing set
of question-answer pairs into a holistic narrative paragraph that reconstructs
the video's event structure; and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), which
generates fine-grained visual rationales, grounding the answer to each question
in specific, relevant evidence. Leveraging powerful generative models, we use
this synthetic data to train VideoQA models under a unified next-token
prediction objective. Extensive experiments on STAR and NExT-QA validate our
approach, demonstrating significant accuracy gains and establishing new
state-of-the-art results, such as improving a 3B model to 72.5\% on STAR
(+4.9\%) and a 7B model to 80.8\% on NExT-QA. Beyond accuracy, our analysis
reveals that both QBP and QBC substantially enhance cross-dataset
generalization, with QBP additionally accelerating model convergence by over
2.5x. These results demonstrate that shifting data synthesis from isolated
facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields a more accurate,
efficient, and generalizable training paradigm.

*Hangil Park,Yongmin Seo,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a dual-model ensemble methodology for anomaly detection (AD) that outperforms existing general and specialized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection models struggle to generalize efficiently across both industrial inspection and semantic anomaly tasks, often requiring dataset-specific fine-tuning.

Method: A dual-model ensemble approach utilizes knowledge distillation with a shared encoder (DINOv2) and combines an Encoder-Decoder model for industrial AD with an Encoder-Encoder model for semantic AD. The joint learning process employs a Noisy-OR objective, incorporating local and semantic anomaly scores to derive a final anomaly score.

Result: The method demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across eight benchmarks. Notably, it achieved an AUROC of 99.7% on MVTec-AD and 97.8% on CIFAR-10 in multi-class settings.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-model ensemble approach resolves limitations in generalization across anomaly detection tasks, achieving superior accuracy and adaptability compared to prior models.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays an important role in various real-world
applications. Recent advancements in AD, however, are often biased towards
industrial inspection, struggle to generalize to broader tasks like semantic
anomaly detection and vice versa. Although recent methods have attempted to
address general anomaly detection, their performance remains sensitive to
dataset-specific settings and single-class tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel dual-model ensemble approach based on knowledge distillation (KD) to
bridge this gap. Our framework consists of a teacher and two student models: an
Encoder-Decoder model, specialized in detecting patch-level minor defects for
industrial AD and an Encoder-Encoder model, optimized for semantic AD. Both
models leverage a shared pre-trained encoder (DINOv2) to extract high-quality
feature representations. The dual models are jointly learned using the Noisy-OR
objective, and the final anomaly score is obtained using the joint probability
via local and semantic anomaly scores derived from the respective models. We
evaluate our method on eight public benchmarks under both single-class and
multi-class settings: MVTec-AD, MVTec-LOCO, VisA and Real-IAD for industrial
inspection and CIFAR-10/100, FMNIST and View for semantic anomaly detection.
The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in both domains, in
multi-class as well as single-class settings, demonstrating generalization
across multiple domains of anomaly detection. Our model achieved an image-level
AUROC of 99.7% on MVTec-AD and 97.8% on CIFAR-10, which is significantly better
than the prior general AD models in multi-class settings and even higher than
the best specialist models on individual benchmarks.

*Heechang Kim,Gwanghyun Kim,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for fine-grained control of human motion generation using Laban Effort and Shape components integrated into text-guided diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion synthesis methods struggle with expressive control due to limited dataset diversity and challenges in quantitatively describing motion using natural language.

Method: The authors propose a zero-shot inference-time optimization method, modifying text embeddings of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling step to incorporate desired Laban tags.

Result: The approach successfully generates diverse expressive motion qualities while preserving the motion's identity, guided by the desired Laban characteristics.

Conclusion: Integrating Laban movement analysis into motion generation frameworks enables interpretable, expressive control in human motion synthesis, overcoming dataset and linguistic limitations.

Abstract: Diverse human motion generation is an increasingly important task, having
various applications in computer vision, human-computer interaction and
animation. While text-to-motion synthesis using diffusion models has shown
success in generating high-quality motions, achieving fine-grained expressive
motion control remains a significant challenge. This is due to the lack of
motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing
quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis has
been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including
motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for
interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly
integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components
into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot,
inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have
desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by
updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling
step. We demonstrate that our approach yields diverse expressive motion
qualities while preserving motion identity by successfully manipulating motion
attributes according to target Laban tags.

*Shijie Lian,Changti Wu,Laurence Tianruo Yang,Hang Yuan,Bin Yu,Lei Zhang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Euclid30K, a geometry-based dataset, and demonstrates how fine-tuning vision-language models on it enhances spatial reasoning across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of spatial intelligence in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by leveraging geometry as a surrogate task.

Method: Developed and utilized the Euclid30K dataset, a collection of 30K geometry problems, and applied Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune MLLMs like Qwen2.5VL and RoboBrain2.0 families.

Result: Fine-tuned models achieved significant zero-shot improvements on spatial reasoning benchmarks such as Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench, VSI-Bench, and MindCube; improved VSI-Bench accuracy from 34.5% to 40.5%.

Conclusion: This study establishes that fine-tuning MLLMs with a geometry-centric approach can develop transferable spatial reasoning skills, setting a new SOTA benchmark in this domain.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising
and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational
positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains
a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To
fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a
surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal
dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid
geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean
principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family,
inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and
perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our
experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot
gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench,
VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after
training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models
rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them,
RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first
systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer
vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and
Euclid30K dataset can be found in https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/Euclids_Gift.

*Julio Hurtado,Haoran Ni,Duygu Sap,Connor Mattinson,Martin Lotz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses scalability in second-hand clothes marketplaces, introducing methods to compress image databases by 90% while maintaining retrieval accuracy for used garment valuation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to support the second-hand fashion market by improving digital infrastructure for scalable and efficient image retrieval of used garments to promote sustainability in the fashion industry.

Method: The authors propose a selective representation framework using clustering, coreset selection, and an outlier removal technique based on a neighbour-homogeneity consistency score to prune irrelevant data.

Result: The proposed system shrinks image databases by 90% while preserving near-optimal retrieval accuracy. Application of the outlier removal step further improves retrieval performance.

Conclusion: The study enhances the scalability and computational efficiency of second-hand fashion marketplaces, making large-scale garment image retrieval more sustainable without degrading accuracy.

Abstract: The fashion industry has been identified as a major contributor to waste and
emissions, leading to an increased interest in promoting the second-hand
market. Machine learning methods play an important role in facilitating the
creation and expansion of second-hand marketplaces by enabling the large-scale
valuation of used garments. We contribute to this line of work by addressing
the scalability of second-hand image retrieval from databases. By introducing a
selective representation framework, we can shrink databases to 10% of their
original size without sacrificing retrieval accuracy. We first explore
clustering and coreset selection methods to identify representative samples
that capture the key features of each garment and its internal variability.
Then, we introduce an efficient outlier removal method, based on a
neighbour-homogeneity consistency score measure, that filters out
uncharacteristic samples prior to selection. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets: DeepFashion Attribute, DeepFashion Con2Shop, and DeepFashion2.
The results demonstrate a clear performance-efficiency trade-off by
strategically pruning and selecting representative vectors of images. The
retrieval system maintains near-optimal accuracy, while greatly reducing
computational costs by reducing the images added to the vector database.
Furthermore, applying our outlier removal method to clustering techniques
yields even higher retrieval performance by removing non-discriminative samples
before the selection.

TL;DR: SCPO method combines semantics, symmetry, and curriculum to mitigate MLLM visual hallucinations, showing a 62.9% reduction in error rates and improved factuality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the persistent issue of visual hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) caused by insufficient semantic distinction and shortcut learning in alignment frameworks like DPO.

Method: A Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO) framework using fine-grained semantic contrasts, dynamic reference modeling, and a bidirectional training objective built progressively in an easy-to-hard curriculum.

Result: SCPO demonstrates a 62.9% reduction in visual hallucination rates on LLaVA models and improves factuality while maintaining general MLLM performance.

Conclusion: SCPO successfully aligns MLLMs by integrating semantics, symmetry, and curriculum, addressing hallucination issues and ensuring balanced performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved the
performance of various tasks, but continue to suffer from visual
hallucinations, a critical issue where generated responses contradict visual
evidence. While Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) is widely used for
alignment, its application to MLLMs often fails to capture fine-grained
semantic differences and encourages shortcut learning. To address these
challenges, we propose Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO), a
novel framework for MLLM alignment. SCPO employs a progressive, easy-to-hard
curriculum built upon our Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, which
provides fine-grained semantic contrasts sorted by difficulty. This curriculum
is trained with a dynamic reference model and a novel symmetric, bidirectional
objective to facilitate simultaneous learning from both textual and visual
preferences. To our knowledge, SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics,
symmetry, and curriculum for MLLMs alignment, effectively mitigating visual
hallucinations. Extensive experiments on LLaVA models across various scales and
versions validate that SCPO demonstrates superior performance compared to
baseline models on multiple hallucination benchmarks, reducing the
hallucination rate by up to 62.9%. Moreover, evaluations on generalized
benchmarks show that SCPO improves factuality while preserving general
capabilities, with its performance remaining stable across general
vision-language benchmarks.

Conclusion: NeMoBench is a reliable, scalable evaluation framework, and facilitates continuous updates to benchmark VideoLLMs, offering valuable insights into model limitations.

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models (VideoLLMs) call for new
evaluation protocols and benchmarks for complex temporal reasoning in
video-language understanding. Inspired by the needle in a haystack test widely
used by LLMs, we introduce a novel task of Needle in a Montage (NeMo), designed
to assess VideoLLMs' critical reasoning capabilities, including long-context

TL;DR: The paper introduces EQUISeg, a framework designed to address modality imbalance in multimodal semantic segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal segmentation methods falter when one modality deteriorates, leading to significant performance drops in real-world conditions.

Method: EQUISeg employs a four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Block for balanced multimodal fusion and introduces a Self-guided Module to allow adaptive modal adjustments in degraded conditions.

Result: Experimental results show substantial performance improvements across datasets, with effective mitigation of modality imbalance issues.

Conclusion: EQUISeg is a robust solution to enhance multimodal segmentation performance by addressing modality imbalance, enabling practical applications in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal semantic segmentation enhances model robustness by exploiting
cross-modal complementarities. However, existing methods often suffer from
imbalanced modal dependencies, where overall performance degrades significantly
once a dominant modality deteriorates in real-world scenarios. Thus, modality
balance has become acritical challenge for practical multimodal segmentation.
To address this issue, we propose EQUISeg, a multimodal segmentation framework
that balances modality contributions through equal encoding of modalities.
Built upon a four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Block(CMTB), EQUISeg enables
efficient multimodal fusion and hierarchical selection. Furthermore, we design
a Self-guided Module(SGM) that mitigates modality imbalance by introducing a
mutual guidance mechanism, enabling each modality to adaptively adjust its
contribution and enhance robustness under degraded conditions. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that EQUISeg achieves significant
performance gains and effectively alleviates the adverse effects of modality
imbalance in segmentation tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces QL-Adapter, a framework for image editing that solves issues with object count, spatial layouts, and diverse categories. The model significantly outperforms existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve complex scene image editing where enforcing object counts, layouts, and accommodating diverse categories is a challenge.

Method: The method involves two modules: ILFM for fusing layout priors with visual tokens and CMAM for enriching text embeddings with image features. Additionally, a QL-Dataset is developed for benchmarking.

Result: QL-Adapter demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in quantity and layout consistent image editing, surpassing existing models.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses gaps in current image editing methods, offering robust solutions for complex object and layout constraints.

Abstract: Instruction driven image editing with standard CLIP text encoders often fails
in complex scenes with many objects. We present QL-Adapter, a framework for
multiple object editing that tackles two challenges: enforcing object counts
and spatial layouts, and accommodating diverse categories. QL-Adapter consists
of two core modules: the Image-Layout Fusion Module (ILFM) and the Cross-Modal
Augmentation Module (CMAM). ILFM fuses layout priors with ViT patch tokens from
the CLIP image encoder to strengthen spatial structure understanding. CMAM
injects image features into the text branch to enrich textual embeddings and
improve instruction following. We further build QL-Dataset, a benchmark that
spans broad category, layout, and count variations, and define the task of
quantity and layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit). Extensive experiments
show that QL-Adapter achieves state of the art performance on QL-Edit and
significantly outperforms existing models.

*Zheyuan Hu,Chieh-Hsin Lai,Yuki Mitsufuji,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Consistency Mid-Training (CMT), a method that stabilizes training for flow map models, achieving state-of-the-art results with reduced computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current flow map models like Consistency Models (CM) and Mean Flow (MF) face instability, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and high training costs, even when initializing from pre-trained diffusion models.

Method: The authors propose mid-training, specifically CMT, as an intermediate training stage. CMT maps solver-generated trajectories from pre-trained diffusion models to clean samples, providing stable initialization for efficient and robust learning.

Result: CMT achieves significant reductions in training data and computational time while outperforming existing methods. It delivers state-of-the-art FID scores across multiple datasets and resolutions.

Conclusion: CMT serves as a principled and efficient framework for stabilizing flow map model training, enabling faster convergence and superior generation quality.

Abstract: Flow map models such as Consistency Models (CM) and Mean Flow (MF) enable
few-step generation by learning the long jump of the ODE solution of diffusion
models, yet training remains unstable, sensitive to hyperparameters, and
costly. Initializing from a pre-trained diffusion model helps, but still
requires converting infinitesimal steps into a long-jump map, leaving
instability unresolved. We introduce mid-training, the first concept and
practical method that inserts a lightweight intermediate stage between the
(diffusion) pre-training and the final flow map training (i.e., post-training)
for vision generation. Concretely, Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) is a compact
and principled stage that trains a model to map points along a solver
trajectory from a pre-trained model, starting from a prior sample, directly to
the solver-generated clean sample. It yields a trajectory-consistent and stable
initialization. This initializer outperforms random and diffusion-based
baselines and enables fast, robust convergence without heuristics. Initializing
post-training with CMT weights further simplifies flow map learning.
Empirically, CMT achieves state of the art two step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10,
1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98%
less training data and GPU time, compared to CMs. On ImageNet 256x256, CMT
reaches 1-step FID 3.34 while cutting total training time by about 50% compared
to MF from scratch (FID 3.43). This establishes CMT as a principled, efficient,
and general framework for training flow map models.

*Mohamad Amin Mirzaei,Pantea Amoie,Ali Ekhterachian,Matin Mirzababaei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper improves 3D semantic mapping for better scene understanding by refining object masks and enhancing semantic context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fragmented masks and inaccurate semantics in 3D mapping limit performance in complex environments.

Method: The approach uses SemanticSAM for improved mask generation and a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy for richer contextual understanding.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing techniques in 3D semantic segmentation and object retrieval tasks on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The advancements in mask refinement and semantic context integration enhance 3D scene understanding for embodied AI applications.

Abstract: 3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics,
supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent
approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning
embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language
models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often
produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct
use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To
address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement
to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the
over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla
SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance
semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that
integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined
weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on
multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and
object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

### [615] [Diffusion Bridge or Flow Matching? A Unifying Framework and Comparative Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24531)
*Kaizhen Zhu,Mokai Pan,Zhechuan Yu,Jingya Wang,Jingyi Yu,Ye Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper compares Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching models, providing unified theoretical and experimental validation of their performance. Diffusion Bridge is proven better in terms of stability and natural trajectories, while Flow Matching struggles when data size is reduced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Confusion exists on the relative merits of Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching due to their differing assumptions and implementations.

Method: The authors recast the frameworks through Stochastic Optimal Control and Optimal Transport, build a novel architecture for Diffusion Bridge using latent Transformers, and implement Flow Matching with identical structure for experimental fairness.

Result: Experiments in diverse transformation tasks confirm Diffusion Bridge's superior stability and Flow Matching's issues with small training datasets. Results align with theoretical claims.

Conclusion: This study clarifies the strengths and weaknesses of both models and advances understanding of distribution transformations using unified theoretical and experimental insights.

Abstract: Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching have both demonstrated compelling
empirical performance in transformation between arbitrary distributions.
However, there remains confusion about which approach is generally preferable,
and the substantial discrepancies in their modeling assumptions and practical
implementations have hindered a unified theoretical account of their relative
merits. We have, for the first time, provided a unified theoretical and
experimental validation of these two models. We recast their frameworks through
the lens of Stochastic Optimal Control and prove that the cost function of the
Diffusion Bridge is lower, guiding the system toward more stable and natural
trajectories. Simultaneously, from the perspective of Optimal Transport,
interpolation coefficients $t$ and $1-t$ of Flow Matching become increasingly
ineffective when the training data size is reduced. To corroborate these
theoretical claims, we propose a novel, powerful architecture for Diffusion
Bridge built on a latent Transformer, and implement a Flow Matching model with
the same structure to enable a fair performance comparison in various
experiments. Comprehensive experiments are conducted across Image Inpainting,
Super-Resolution, Deblurring, Denoising, Translation, and Style Transfer tasks,
systematically varying both the distributional discrepancy (different
difficulty) and the training data size. Extensive empirical results align
perfectly with our theoretical predictions and allow us to delineate the
respective advantages and disadvantages of these two models. Our code is

*Yuhao Wang,Zhuoran Zheng,Han Hu,Dianjie Lu,Guijuan Zhang,Chen Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a crowd counting method tailored for foggy environments, combining a physical atmospheric scattering model with advanced data-driven techniques to address challenges like feature degradation and image blurring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle crowd counting difficulties in foggy environments caused by factors such as long-range blurring and local feature reduction.

Method: The approach includes a differentiable atmospheric scattering model, dynamic transmittance estimation, adaptive scattering calibration, and a learnable edge activation function (MSA-KAN) based on Kolmogorov-Arnold representation. It integrates progressive architecture and skip connections with a weather-aware GCN for spatial adjacency matrix construction.

Result: Experiments on four public datasets show a 12.2%-27.5% reduction in MAE metrics compared to other algorithms in dense fog environments.

Conclusion: Combining physical and data-driven elements provides substantial improvements in crowd counting accuracy under foggy conditions.

Abstract: Aiming at the key challenges of crowd counting in foggy environments, such as
long-range target blurring, local feature degradation, and image contrast
attenuation, this paper proposes a crowd-counting method with a physical a
priori of atmospheric scattering, which improves crowd counting accuracy under
complex meteorological conditions through the synergistic optimization of the
physical mechanism and data-driven.Specifically, first, the method introduces a
differentiable atmospheric scattering model and employs transmittance dynamic
estimation and scattering parameter adaptive calibration techniques to
accurately quantify the nonlinear attenuation laws of haze on targets with
different depths of field.Secondly, the MSA-KAN was designed based on the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem to construct a learnable edge
activation function. By integrating a multi-layer progressive architecture with
adaptive skip connections, it significantly enhances the model's nonlinear
representation capability in feature-degraded regions, effectively suppressing
feature confusion under fog interference.Finally, we further propose a
weather-aware GCN that dynamically constructs spatial adjacency matrices using
deep features extracted by MSA-KAN. Experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves a 12.2\%-27.5\% reduction in MAE metrics
compared to mainstream algorithms in dense fog scenarios.

*Fankai Jia,Daisong Gan,Zhe Zhang,Zhaochi Wen,Chenchen Dan,Dong Liang,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the MMRQA framework, which integrates multimodal large language models with acquisition-aware signal processing to enhance MRI quality assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI quality assessment is critical for clinical decisions yet challenging due to data scarcity, variability, and the trade-offs between signal-based methods and deep learning approaches.

Method: MMRQA combines metric extraction using MRQy (augmented with simulated artifacts), transformation of metrics into Q&A pairs with Qwen, and fusion through LoRA of LLaVA-OneVision.

Result: MMRQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, strong zero-shot generalization, and provides clinically interpretable outputs as validated on multiple benchmarks with ablation studies.

Conclusion: The MMRQA framework enhances quality assessment in dynamic medical settings by bridging quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quality assessment is crucial for clinical
decision-making, yet remains challenging due to data scarcity and protocol
variability. Traditional approaches face fundamental trade-offs: signal-based
methods like MRIQC provide quantitative metrics but lack semantic
understanding, while deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy but
sacrifice interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Multimodal MRI Quality Assessment (MMRQA) framework, pioneering the integration
of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with acquisition-aware signal
processing. MMRQA combines three key innovations: robust metric extraction via
MRQy augmented with simulated artifacts, structured transformation of metrics
into question-answer pairs using Qwen, and parameter-efficient fusion through
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of LLaVA-OneVision. Evaluated on MR-ART, FastMRI,
and MyConnectome benchmarks, MMRQA achieves state-of-the-art performance with
strong zero-shot generalization, as validated by comprehensive ablation
studies. By bridging quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning, our
framework generates clinically interpretable outputs that enhance quality
control in dynamic medical settings.

### [618] [TokenSwap: Backdoor Attack on the Compositional Understanding of Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24566)
*Zhifang Zhang,Qiqi Tao,Jiaqi Lv,Na Zhao,Lei Feng,Joey Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TokenSwap, a stealthy backdoor attack that disrupts object relationship understanding in large vision-language models (LVLMs), achieving high attack success while remaining hard to detect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs are easily detectable as they use fixed target patterns that make models overconfident when given poisoned inputs. There is a need for a stealthier approach.

Method: TokenSwap subtly corrupts LVLMs' comprehension by injecting visual triggers and swapping grammatical roles of key tokens in text during training. It uses a token-weighted loss to enforce learning of swapped tokens.

Result: TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates and maintains stealthiness and evasiveness across various LVLM benchmarks and architectures.

Conclusion: TokenSwap is an effective and hard-to-detect backdoor attack that exploits LVLMs' compositional understanding, making them misrepresent object relationships while appearing functional.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, while they remain vulnerable to
backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs aim to force the victim
model to generate a predefined target pattern, which is either inserted into or
replaces the original content. We find that these fixed-pattern attacks are
relatively easy to detect, because the attacked LVLM tends to memorize such
frequent patterns in the training dataset, thereby exhibiting overconfidence on
these targets given poisoned inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce
TokenSwap, a more evasive and stealthy backdoor attack that focuses on the
compositional understanding capabilities of LVLMs. Instead of enforcing a fixed
targeted content, TokenSwap subtly disrupts the understanding of object
relationships in text. Specifically, it causes the backdoored model to generate
outputs that mention the correct objects in the image but misrepresent their
relationships (i.e., bags-of-words behavior). During training, TokenSwap
injects a visual trigger into selected samples and simultaneously swaps the
grammatical roles of key tokens in the corresponding textual answers. However,
the poisoned samples exhibit only subtle differences from the original ones,
making it challenging for the model to learn the backdoor behavior. To address
this, TokenSwap employs an adaptive token-weighted loss that explicitly
emphasizes the learning of swapped tokens, such that the visual triggers and
bags-of-words behavior are associated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior
evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM
architectures.

### [619] [BFSM: 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull Morphable Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24577)
*Zidu Wang,Meng Xu,Miao Xu,Hengyuan Ma,Jiankuo Zhao,Xutao Li,Xiangyu Zhu,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops a 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull Morphable Model (BFSM) that bridges faces and skulls for applications in medicine and simulation, overcoming data scarcity and inclusivity issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address challenges in creating a face-skull morphable model, such as the lack of paired datasets, poor registration techniques, underrepresentation of craniofacial deformities, and limited practical application exploration.

Method: The authors construct a dataset of over 200 cases including craniofacial deformities, propose a dense ray matching registration method for consistent topology, and introduce the BFSM for bidirectional shape inference using a shared coefficient space.

Result: The BFSM successfully performs 3D face-skull reconstruction, models tissue thickness variations, and demonstrates applications in single-image reconstruction and surgical planning. Experiments show its robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: This work contributes a novel dataset and methodology, advancing face-skull modeling and presenting promising medical and clinical applications, while ensuring inclusivity for craniofacial deformity cases.

Abstract: Building a joint face-skull morphable model holds great potential for
applications such as remote diagnostics, surgical planning, medical education,
and physically based facial simulation. However, realizing this vision is
constrained by the scarcity of paired face-skull data, insufficient
registration accuracy, and limited exploration of reconstruction and clinical
applications. Moreover, individuals with craniofacial deformities are often
overlooked, resulting in underrepresentation and limited inclusivity. To
address these challenges, we first construct a dataset comprising over 200
samples, including both normal cases and rare craniofacial conditions. Each
case contains a CT-based skull, a CT-based face, and a high-fidelity textured
face scan. Secondly, we propose a novel dense ray matching registration method
that ensures topological consistency across face, skull, and their tissue
correspondences. Based on this, we introduce the 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull
Morphable Model (BFSM), which enables shape inference between the face and
skull through a shared coefficient space, while also modeling tissue thickness
variation to support one-to-many facial reconstructions from the same skull,
reflecting individual changes such as fat over time. Finally, we demonstrate
the potential of BFSM in medical applications, including 3D face-skull
reconstruction from a single image and surgical planning prediction. Extensive
experiments confirm the robustness and accuracy of our method. BFSM is

### [620] [Comprehensive Benchmarking of YOLOv11 Architectures for Scalable and Granular Peripheral Blood Cell Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24595)
*Mohamad Abou Ali,Mariam Abdulfattah,Baraah Al Hussein,Fadi Dornaika,Ali Cherry,Mohamad Hajj-Hassan,Lara Hamawy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study focuses on developing a deep learning framework for fine-grained detection of peripheral blood cells, using YOLOv11 and a newly curated dataset of 16,891 images with 298,850 annotated cells.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual peripheral blood smear analysis is subjective and labor-intensive, creating a need for automated approaches that offer accuracy and efficiency such as through deep learning.

Method: The authors curate a large dataset (16,891 images with annotations for detection tasks) and benchmark five YOLOv11 variants under different data split strategies using metrics like mAP, precision, recall, F1 score, and computational efficiency.

Result: The YOLOv11 Medium model achieved the best trade-off with a mAP@0.5 of 0.934 using an 8:1:1 data split, while larger models offered minimal accuracy gain at higher computational costs.

Conclusion: YOLOv11 Medium is highly effective for automated peripheral blood smear detection. The study also introduces a publicly available dataset to advance research in hematology.

Abstract: Manual peripheral blood smear (PBS) analysis is labor intensive and
subjective. While deep learning offers a promising alternative, a systematic
evaluation of state of the art models such as YOLOv11 for fine grained PBS
detection is still lacking. In this work, we make two key contributions. First,
we curate a large scale annotated dataset for blood cell detection and
classification, comprising 16,891 images across 12 peripheral blood cell (PBC)
classes, along with the red blood cell class, all carefully re annotated for
object detection tasks. In total, the dataset contains 298,850 annotated cells.
Second, we leverage this dataset to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five
YOLOv11 variants (ranging from Nano to XLarge). These models are rigorously
benchmarked under two data splitting strategies (70:20:10 and 80:10:10) and
systematically assessed using multiple performance criteria, including mean
Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, F1 score, and computational
efficiency. Our experiments show that the YOLOv11 Medium variant achieves the
best trade off, reaching a mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under the 8:1:1 split. Larger
models (Large and XLarge) provide only marginal accuracy gains at substantially
higher computational cost. Moreover, the 8:1:1 split consistently outperforms
the 7:2:1 split across all models. These findings highlight YOLOv11,
particularly the Medium variant, as a highly effective framework for automated,
fine grained PBS detection. Beyond benchmarking, our publicly released dataset
(github.com/Mohamad-AbouAli/OI-PBC-Dataset) offers a valuable resource to
advance research on blood cell detection and classification in hematology.

*Bikash Kumar Badatya,Vipul Baghel,Jyotirmoy Amin,Ravi Hegde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an unsupervised framework leveraging structured optimal transport (SOT) with ASTGCN for segmenting biomechanical phases in javelin-throwing, significantly outperforming existing methods. A new dataset of annotated videos is also released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate motion analysis in sports is essential but traditional methods are manual, expensive, and non-scalable. There is a need for automatic, unsupervised techniques for better temporal segmentation in activities like javelin-throwing.

Method: An unsupervised framework using structured optimal transport (SOT) integrated into Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ASTGCN) is introduced for detecting motion phase transitions without manual labeling.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance with 71.02% mean average precision and 74.61% F1-score, outperforming other unsupervised techniques.

Conclusion: The framework improves unsupervised athletic motion analysis, making it scalable and effective. The release of a professionally annotated dataset furthers research in this domain.

Abstract: Precise analysis of athletic motion is central to sports analytics,
particularly in disciplines where nuanced biomechanical phases directly impact
performance outcomes. Traditional analytics techniques rely on manual
annotation or laboratory-based instrumentation, which are time-consuming,
costly, and lack scalability. Automatic extraction of relevant kinetic
variables requires a robust and contextually appropriate temporal segmentation.
Considering the specific case of elite javelin-throw, we present a novel
unsupervised framework for such a contextually aware segmentation, which
applies the structured optimal transport (SOT) concept to augment the
well-known Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network
(ASTGCN). This enables the identification of motion phase transitions without
requiring expensive manual labeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, achieving 71.02%
mean average precision (mAP) and 74.61% F1-score on test data, substantially
higher than competing baselines. We also release a new dataset of 211 manually
annotated professional javelin-throw videos with frame-level annotations,
covering key biomechanical phases: approach steps, drive, throw, and recovery.

*Yuhan Zhu,Xiangyu Zeng,Chenting Wang,Xinhao Li,Yicheng Xu,Ziang Yan,Yi Wang,Limin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FreeRet, a framework to use off-the-shelf multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for retrieval without additional training by turning them into two-stage retrievers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the heavy post-hoc training typically required to enable MLLMs to perform as effective retrieval models, seeking to utilize pretrained MLLMs directly for this task.

Method: FreeRet employs a two-stage approach: semantic embedding generation for initial search and reasoning-based reranking. It introduces three novel techniques: bypassing lexical alignment, conditioning with explicit priors, and neutral framing in reranking.

Result: FreeRet demonstrates superior performance compared to heavily trained models across 46 datasets in the MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks. It also generalizes effectively across different MLLM families and sizes.

Conclusion: This study shows that pretrained MLLMs, when leveraged appropriately, can function as robust retrieval systems without requiring additional training, emphasizing their untapped potential as generalist tools.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are emerging as versatile
foundations for mixed-modality retrieval. Yet, they often require heavy
post-hoc training to convert them into contrastive encoders for retrieval. This
work asks: Can off-the-shelf MLLMs serve as powerful retrievers without
additional training? We present FreeRet, a plug-and-play framework that turns
any MLLM into a two-stage retriever. FreeRet first derives semantically
grounded embeddings directly from the model for fast candidate search, and then
exploits its reasoning ability for precise reranking. The framework contributes
three advances: bypassing lexical alignment layers to obtain semantically
faithful embeddings, conditioning representation generation with explicit
priors, and mitigating framing effect in reranking via neutral choice framing.
On the MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks spanning 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially
outperforms models trained on millions of pairs. Beyond benchmarks, FreeRet is
model-agnostic and scales seamlessly across MLLM families and sizes, preserves
their generative abilities, supports arbitrary modality combinations, and
unifies retrieval, reranking, and generation into end-to-end RAG within a
single model. Our findings demonstrate that pretrained MLLMs, when carefully
harnessed, can serve as strong retrieval engines without training, closing a
critical gap in their role as generalists.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPLICE, a benchmark derived from instructional videos for testing event-based reasoning. Vision-language models significantly underperform compared to humans in rearranging event clips into sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in assessing visual reasoning capabilities across dimensions like temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and general knowledge with a standardized benchmark.

Method: The authors curated SPLICE from the COIN instructional video dataset, segmenting 3,381 videos into 11,423 clips. They evaluated human participants and vision-language models by testing their abilities to sequence these event clips coherently.

Result: Vision-language models struggled significantly compared to humans in reasoning tasks. While textual annotations improved model accuracy, they did not bridge the gap to human-level performance.

Conclusion: Vision-language models heavily rely on language priors rather than visual understanding. Persistent challenges exist in visual reasoning, especially in contextual and spatial domains, compared to human capabilities.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce SPLICE, a human-curated benchmark derived from the
COIN instructional video dataset, designed to probe event-based reasoning
across multiple dimensions: temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and general
knowledge. SPLICE includes 3,381 human-filtered videos spanning 12 categories
and 180 sub-categories, such as sports, engineering, and housework. These
videos are segmented into a total of 11,423 event clips. We evaluate both human
participants and state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on the task of
rearranging these clips into coherent event sequences to assess visual
reasoning capabilities. Results reveal a significant gap: VLMs struggle to
match human performance. While human-annotated textual descriptions improve
model accuracy, they do not affect human performance, suggesting that models
rely more on language priors than on visual understanding. Even with
annotations, VLMs fall short of human-level reasoning, underscoring persistent
challenges in visual reasoning. A deeper analysis across sub-categories shows
that VLMs perform relatively better on videos where temporal and causal
reasoning are dominant, compared to those where contextual and spatial
reasoning are dominant. They also perform better on everyday tasks than on
specialized ones.

### [624] [RIFLE: Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24644)
*Zhu,Libo,Zhou,Zihan,Liu,Xiaoyang,Zhang,Weihang,Shi,Keyu,Fu,Yifan,Zhang,Yulun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses flicker-banding (FB) artifacts in screen photos by introducing a novel framework, RIFLE, which uses diffusion-based techniques for effective FB removal while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flicker-banding artifacts, caused by temporal aliasing between camera readouts and display brightness modulation, often degrade image quality and readability but remain underexplored compared to moiré patterns.

Method: The RIFLE framework includes a flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) to predict and incorporate banding attributes, a masked loss function to emphasize supervision on affected areas, and a custom simulation pipeline for realistic FB artifact generation.

Result: RIFLE demonstrates superior performance in removing FB across various conditions on a specially collected real-world dataset, outperforming other state-of-the-art image restoration methods in both visual and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: This research is the first to thoroughly study both the removal and simulation of flicker-banding, laying a robust groundwork for future advancements in dataset creation and FB restoration methodologies.

Abstract: Capturing screens is now routine in our everyday lives. But the photographs
of emissive displays are often influenced by the flicker-banding (FB), which is
alternating bright%u2013dark stripes that arise from temporal aliasing between
a camera's rolling-shutter readout and the display's brightness modulation.
Unlike moire degradation, which has been extensively studied, the FB remains
underexplored despite its frequent and severe impact on readability and
perceived quality. We formulate FB removal as a dedicated restoration task and
introduce Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement,
RIFLE, a diffusion-based framework designed to remove FB while preserving fine
details. We propose the flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) that predicts key
banding attributes and injects it into the restoration network. Additionally,
Masked Loss (ML) is proposed to concentrate supervision on banded regions
without sacrificing global fidelity. To overcome data scarcity, we provide a
simulation pipeline that synthesizes FB in the luminance domain with stochastic
jitter in banding angle, banding spacing, and banding width. Feathered
boundaries and sensor noise are also applied for a more realistic simulation.
For evaluation, we collect a paired real-world FB dataset with pixel-aligned
banding-free references captured via long exposure. Across quantitative metrics
and visual comparisons on our real-world dataset, RIFLE consistently
outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines from mild to severe
flicker-banding. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to research
the simulation and removal of FB. Our work establishes a great foundation for
subsequent research in both the dataset construction and the removal model
design. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to adapt pretrained diffusion models for object-centric image and video generation while maintaining global scene coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance scene representation in AI by enabling object-level control for fine-grained, compositional image and video generation, addressing the mismatch in current diffusion models.

Method: Proposes SlotAdapt for images and an extended video framework using Invariant Slot Attention (ISA) and a temporal aggregator, allowing object-specific manipulation and consistent object dynamics.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art in object discovery, segmentation, compositional editing, and generated new video benchmarks for unsupervised object segmentation and advanced editing.

Conclusion: The study offers a scalable approach to object-centric generative modeling by combining human perception with machine learning, opening new possibilities for interactive and structured generation in creative and scientific fields.

Abstract: A central goal in AI is to represent scenes as compositions of discrete
objects, enabling fine-grained, controllable image and video generation. Yet
leading diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text
conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. This thesis
introduces a framework that adapts powerful pretrained diffusion models for
object-centric synthesis while retaining their generative capacity.
  We identify a core challenge: balancing global scene coherence with
disentangled object control. Our method integrates lightweight, slot-based
conditioning into pretrained models, preserving their visual priors while
providing object-specific manipulation. For images, SlotAdapt augments
diffusion models with a register token for background/style and
slot-conditioned modules for objects, reducing text-conditioning bias and
achieving state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation,
compositional editing, and controllable image generation.
  We further extend the framework to video. Using Invariant Slot Attention
(ISA) to separate object identity from pose and a Transformer-based temporal
aggregator, our approach maintains consistent object representations and
dynamics across frames. This yields new benchmarks in unsupervised video object
segmentation and reconstruction, and supports advanced editing tasks such as
object removal, replacement, and insertion without explicit supervision.
  Overall, this work establishes a general and scalable approach to
object-centric generative modeling for images and videos. By bridging human
object-based perception and machine learning, it expands the design space for
interactive, structured, and user-driven generative tools in creative,
scientific, and practical domains.

Method: VNODE integrates nonlinear Volterra filtering for discrete feature extraction with continuous time neural ordinary differential equations for state evolution in image classification tasks.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets like CIFAR10 and Imagenet1K show that VNODE achieves better performance compared to state-of-the-art models, with improved computational efficiency.

Conclusion: VNODE demonstrates that combining discrete and continuous processing can effectively capture complex patterns, offering a promising direction for efficient and high-performance deep learning architectures.

Abstract: This paper introduces Volterra Neural Ordinary Differential Equations
(VNODE), a piecewise continuous Volterra Neural Network that integrates
nonlinear Volterra filtering with continuous time neural ordinary differential
equations for image classification. Drawing inspiration from the visual cortex,
where discrete event processing is interleaved with continuous integration,
VNODE alternates between discrete Volterra feature extraction and ODE driven
state evolution. This hybrid formulation captures complex patterns while
requiring substantially fewer parameters than conventional deep architectures.
VNODE consistently outperforms state of the art models with improved
computational complexity as exemplified on benchmark datasets like CIFAR10 and
Imagenet1K.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on enhancing open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation by improving the classification component with a lightweight text adapter, achieving significant metric improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the challenge of generalizing to camouflaged objects of unseen categories during training, where existing methods show limitations in the classification component.

Method: The researchers propose a classifier-centric adaptive framework incorporating a lightweight text adapter with a novel layered asymmetric initialization to enhance the classification component.

Result: The method improved segmentation metrics on the OVCamo benchmark, including cIoU from 0.443 to 0.493, cSm from 0.579 to 0.658, and cMAE from 0.336 to 0.239, compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: The results validate that focusing on classification enhancement significantly boosts the performance of open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation requires models to segment
camouflaged objects of arbitrary categories unseen during training, placing
extremely high demands on generalization capabilities. Through analysis of
existing methods, it is observed that the classification component
significantly affects overall segmentation performance. Accordingly, a
classifier-centric adaptive framework is proposed to enhance segmentation
performance by improving the classification component via a lightweight text
adapter with a novel layered asymmetric initialization. Through the
classification enhancement, the proposed method achieves substantial
improvements in segmentation metrics compared to the OVCoser baseline on the
OVCamo benchmark: cIoU increases from 0.443 to 0.493, cSm from 0.579 to 0.658,
and cMAE reduces from 0.336 to 0.239. These results demonstrate that targeted
classification enhancement provides an effective approach for advancing
camouflaged object segmentation performance.

Conclusion: The developed pipeline is effective for segmenting TBI lesions, and the implementation has been made publicly accessible.

Abstract: The identification and segmentation of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury
(TBI) lesions pose a significant challenge in neuroimaging. This difficulty
arises from the extreme heterogeneity of these lesions, which vary in size,
number, and laterality, thereby complicating downstream image processing tasks
such as image registration and brain parcellation, reducing the analytical
accuracy. Thus, developing methods for highly accurate segmentation of TBI
lesions is essential for reliable neuroimaging analysis. This study aims to
develop an effective automated segmentation pipeline to automatically detect
and segment TBI lesions in T1-weighted MRI scans. We evaluate multiple
approaches to achieve accurate segmentation of the TBI lesions. The core of our
pipeline leverages various architectures within the nnUNet framework for
initial segmentation, complemented by post-processing strategies to enhance
evaluation metrics. Our final submission to the challenge achieved an accuracy
of 0.8451, Dice score values of 0.4711 and 0.8514 for images with and without
visible lesions, respectively, with an overall Dice score of 0.5973, ranking
among the top-6 methods in the AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge. The Python
implementation of our pipeline is publicly available.

### [629] [TemMed-Bench: Evaluating Temporal Medical Image Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25143)
*Junyi Zhang,Jia-Chen Gu,Wenbo Hu,Yu Zhou,Robinson Piramuthu,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TemMed-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate large vision-language models (LVLMs) on their ability to analyze temporal medical images—a task crucial for real-world clinical practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to test the ability of LVLMs to analyze changes in a patient's condition over time, which is essential for clinical practice.

Method: The authors designed TemMed-Bench, a test suite with three tasks (VQA, report generation, and image-pair selection) and a supplementary knowledge corpus, to evaluate LVLMs' performance on temporal medical reasoning.

Result: Most LVLMs struggle with analyzing temporal medical images and perform close to random guessing. Some models (e.g., GPT o3/o4-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) perform better but are still limited. Input augmentation with multi-modal retrieval significantly improves performance.

Conclusion: TemMed-Bench highlights the shortcomings of current LVLMs in temporal medical reasoning. Multi-modal retrieval augmentation is a promising approach to address these challenges, as it demonstrates notable improvements.

Abstract: Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily
focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit.
However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice,
where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a
comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we
introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in
patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large
vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images.
TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual
question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a
supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we
conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results
show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes
over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a
random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini
and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they
have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the
input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain.
We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher
performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most
models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of
2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical
practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image
reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval
augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address
this challenge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SANA-Video, an efficient diffusion model for generating high-quality, long videos quickly and at a reduced cost, deployable even on consumer-grade GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational cost and inefficiency in generating long, high-resolution videos using existing state-of-the-art diffusion models.

Method: Implemented Linear DiT with linear attention for efficiency, and designed a constant-memory KV cache for long video generation. Additionally utilized specific data filters and training strategies to further optimize cost and performance.

Result: SANA-Video performs competitively against modern state-of-the-art models, achieving a 16x faster latency and a 2.4x speedup in video generation on RTX 5090 GPUs, while reducing training costs to just 1% of MovieGen.

Conclusion: SANA-Video represents a significant advance in video diffusion models, enabling low-cost, efficient, and high-quality video generation at resolutions up to 720x1280 and durations of minutes.

Abstract: We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently
generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration.
SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with
strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090
GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video
generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation,
which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens
processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear
Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video
generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative
properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with
global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional
KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we
explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the
training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of
MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance
compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B
and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover,
SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating
the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x
speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video
generation.

*Fan Yuan,Yuchen Yan,Yifan Jiang,Haoran Zhao,Tao Feng,Jinyan Chen,Yanwei Lou,Wenqi Zhang,Yongliang Shen,Weiming Lu,Jun Xiao,Yueting Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces GSM8K-V, a visual mathematical reasoning benchmark aiming to test vision-language models on multi-image reasoning tasks. Existing models show significant performance gaps when transitioning from text-based to visual formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models perform well on text-based reasoning tasks but struggle with visual mathematical reasoning, especially across multiple images. This study aims to address benchmark limitations in this domain.

Method: The authors created GSM8K-V by converting samples from the text-based GSM8K benchmark into a purely visual format using an automated image-generation pipeline and human annotations. Evaluations were conducted on various models.

Result: Results reveal a significant drop in model performance going from text-based GSM8K to visual GSM8K-V; the best model achieved 95.22% on GSM8K but only 46.93% on GSM8K-V.

Conclusion: GSM8K-V highlights deficiencies in current vision-language models for visual mathematical reasoning, offering a new benchmark to guide future advancements in the field.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve unified modeling of images and text,
enabling them to accomplish complex real-world tasks through perception,
planning, and reasoning. Among these tasks, reasoning is particularly
representative, with mathematical reasoning serving as a prominent example. It
highlights the high-level capability of VLMs to comprehend mathematical
information in images and to perform sophisticated reasoning. Recently,
numerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they
are often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and
rarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we
introduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning
benchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the
widely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed
automated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation,
we curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source
and closed-source models on GSM8K-V. Results show that although existing VLMs
have nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, there remains
substantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing
model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on
GSM8K-V. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of GSM8K-V, examining the
limitations of current models as well as potential directions for improvement.
GSM8K-V offers a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and
establishes a benchmark to guide the development of more robust and
generalizable VLMs.

*Yutong Hao,Chen Chen,Ajmal Saeed Mian,Chang Xu,Daochang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a training-free framework to enhance physical plausibility in video diffusion models using counterfactual prompts and a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video diffusion models often produce implausible motions that violate physics due to the reliance on large-scale text-video datasets, which are costly and difficult to scale.

Method: The framework introduces a physics-aware reasoning pipeline to construct counterfactual prompts and employs a Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG) strategy to suppress physics-violating content during denoising.

Result: The method significantly improves physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism across various physical domains, without requiring additional training.

Conclusion: The proposed approach creates a new, plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation, validated through experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: Diffusion models can generate realistic videos, but existing methods rely on
implicitly learning physical reasoning from large-scale text-video datasets,
which is costly, difficult to scale, and still prone to producing implausible
motions that violate fundamental physical laws. We introduce a training-free
framework that improves physical plausibility at inference time by explicitly
reasoning about implausibility and guiding the generation away from it.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to
construct counterfactual prompts that deliberately encode physics-violating
behaviors. Then, we propose a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG)
strategy, which leverages these prompts through synchronized directional
normalization to counteract lagged suppression and trajectory-decoupled
denoising to mitigate cumulative trajectory bias, ensuring that implausible
content is suppressed immediately and consistently throughout denoising.
Experiments across different physical domains show that our approach
substantially enhances physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism,
despite requiring no additional training. Ablation studies confirm the
complementary effectiveness of both the physics-aware reasoning component and
SDG. In particular, the aforementioned two designs of SDG are also individually
validated to contribute critically to the suppression of implausible content
and the overall gains in physical plausibility. This establishes a new and
plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IWR-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on interactive webpage reconstruction tasks, focusing on dynamic interactions and code generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing webpage-to-code benchmarks focus on static tasks, neglecting the dynamic, interactive aspects of real-world web applications.

Method: IWR-Bench offers 113 tasks derived from real-world websites, including user interaction videos and assets, evaluating models on multi-modal reasoning and advanced code generation. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a metric system assesses models.

Result: Experiments on 28 LVLMs show poor performance, with the top model achieving only a 36.35% overall score, highlighting deficiencies in reasoning about temporal dynamics and event-driven logic.

Conclusion: IWR-Bench sets a new, challenging benchmark for advancing vision-language model research in interactive and dynamic contexts. The benchmark and related codebase will be publicly available.

Abstract: The webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations
of webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks
primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the
dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address
this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for
evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in
interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113
meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and
featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles,
and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task
includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets
(e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental
challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from
video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into
functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric
system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of
generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant
challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as
functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity
(64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models'
ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic,
establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research.
The benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Vietnamese-language medical dataset with paired CT-PET images and clinical reports to improve Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in handling functional imaging tasks and low-resource languages, especially Vietnamese.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the scarcity of PET/CT imaging data and the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, like Vietnamese, in Vision-Language Models for medical AI applications.

Method: The study creates a novel dataset with 1,567,062 CT-PET images and 2,757 clinical reports in Vietnamese, employing data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. It also benchmarks existing VLMs on tasks like medical report generation and visual question answering.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that the new dataset significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs on medical imaging tasks.

Conclusion: The dataset fills critical gaps in functional imaging and low-resource languages, advancing Vision-Language Models' development and clinical applications in Vietnamese healthcare.

Abstract: Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs), trained on large-scale multimodal
datasets, have driven significant advances in Artificial Intelligence by
enabling rich cross-modal reasoning. Despite their success in general domains,
applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited
availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most
existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus
primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and
clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset comprising 1,567,062 paired
CT-PET images and corresponding 2,757 full-length clinical reports. This
dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1)
the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which
hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks;
and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the
Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report
pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs'
learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We
conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on
downstream tasks, including medical report generation and visual question
answering. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset
significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this
dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development
of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, particularly in low-resource
languages, and improving their clinical relevance in Vietnamese healthcare.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-modal tracking approach combining RGB, Depth, and Thermal Infrared, supported by a new dataset and innovative model, RDTTrack, achieving enhanced accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches face challenges in complex scenarios due to limited modalities (e.g., RGB-Depth or RGB-Thermal). This paper aims to enhance robustness by using three complementary modalities.

Method: The authors created a tri-modal tracking dataset (RGBDT500) and proposed a novel tracker, RDTTrack, that fuses RGB, Depth, and Thermal data using orthogonal projection constraints and prompt learning techniques.

Result: Experimental results show that RDTTrack significantly outperforms existing dual-modal tracking methods in accuracy and robustness, particularly in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: Leveraging RGB, Depth, and Thermal Infrared modalities in a unified framework (RDTTrack) enhances tracking robustness and opens new possibilities for multi-modal tracking research.

Abstract: Existing multi-modal object tracking approaches primarily focus on dual-modal
paradigms, such as RGB-Depth or RGB-Thermal, yet remain challenged in complex
scenarios due to limited input modalities. To address this gap, this work
introduces a novel multi-modal tracking task that leverages three complementary
modalities, including visible RGB, Depth (D), and Thermal Infrared (TIR),
aiming to enhance robustness in complex scenarios. To support this task, we
construct a new multi-modal tracking dataset, coined RGBDT500, which consists
of 500 videos with synchronised frames across the three modalities. Each frame
provides spatially aligned RGB, depth, and thermal infrared images with precise
object bounding box annotations. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal
tracker, dubbed RDTTrack. RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information for robust
tracking by leveraging a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning
techniques. In specific, RDTTrack fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities
under a proposed orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with
RGB signals as prompts for the pre-trained foundation tracking model,
effectively harmonising tri-modal complementary cues. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, showing
significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of
tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.

TL;DR: ExGS introduces an efficient feed-forward framework combining Universal Gaussian Compression (UGC) for aggressive pruning and GaussPainter for high-quality restoration. Achieves over 100× compression while maintaining rendering fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural scene representations face storage and transmission challenges in resource-constrained settings, and existing compression methods suffer trade-offs between efficiency and quality.

Method: ExGS combines UGC for re-optimization-free aggressive pruning and GaussPainter with diffusion priors for restoring and enhancing heavily pruned Gaussian scenes, using a lightweight VAE and one-step diffusion design.

Result: Achieves over 100× compression, reducing models from 354.77 MB to approximately 3.31 MB, while preserving and enhancing rendering fidelity.

Conclusion: ExGS demonstrates diffusion priors' effectiveness in overcoming compression-quality trade-offs, consolidating high compression ratios with high-quality rendering.

Abstract: Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have
enabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and
transmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow
and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which
degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent
data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this
trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering
quality. We introduce \textbf{ExGS}, a novel feed-forward framework that
unifies \textbf{Universal Gaussian Compression} (UGC) with
\textbf{GaussPainter} for \textbf{Ex}treme 3D\textbf{GS} compression.
\textbf{UGC} performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce
Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas
\textbf{GaussPainter} leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided
refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian
scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing
regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in
degraded renderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a
one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can
even achieve over $100\times$ compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model
to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image
quality under challenging conditions. These results highlight the central role
of diffusion priors in bridging the gap between extreme compression and
high-quality neural rendering. Our code repository will be released at

Motivation: MLLMs have limitations in grounding reasoning tasks with perceptual evidence, necessitating improved strategies for integrating perception into reasoning.

Method: The authors introduce VTPerception-R1, a two-stage framework: Stage 1 leverages perception-augmented fine-tuning, while Stage 2 employs perception-aware reinforcement learning with new visual, textual, and consistency rewards.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that VTPerception-R1 improves reasoning accuracy and robustness across benchmarks, especially for smaller models, and offers scalability and auditability.

Conclusion: Explicit perception, combined with textual cues, is crucial for enhanced reasoning in MLLMs. VTPerception-R1 provides a robust and scalable approach for integrating perception into multimodal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to ground reasoning
in perceptual evidence. We present a systematic study of perception
strategies-explicit, implicit, visual, and textual-across four multimodal
benchmarks and two MLLMs. Our findings show that explicit perception,
especially when paired with textual cues, consistently yields the best
improvements, particularly for smaller models. Based on this insight, we
propose VTPerception-R1, a unified two-stage framework that decouples
perception from reasoning. Stage 1 introduces perception-augmented fine-tuning,
and Stage 2 applies perception-aware reinforcement learning with novel visual,
textual, and consistency rewards. Experiments demonstrate that VTPerception-R1
significantly improves reasoning accuracy and robustness across diverse tasks,
offering a scalable and auditable solution for perception-grounded multimodal

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'SkyLink,' a method leveraging data enhancement, local feature aggregation, and 3D scene construction to improve cross-view geo-localization, achieving significant accuracy on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of establishing robust location correspondences between street and satellite viewpoints, which is hindered by semantic degradation caused by extreme viewpoint disparities.

Method: The approach involves data enhancement using Google Retrieval Enhancement Module, local feature aggregation via the Patch-Aware Feature Aggregation module, and integrating multi-scale 3D scene information for feature alignment through self-supervised and cross-view contrastive learning.

Result: 'SkyLink' achieves 25.75% Recall@1 accuracy on University-1652 in the UAVM2025 Challenge, demonstrating robustness and generalization across diverse urban scenarios.

Conclusion: The work highlights the importance of integrating diverse modules and using UAV-based 3D scene information to overcome viewpoint variation challenges effectively in cross-view geo-localization tasks.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims at establishing location correspondences
between different viewpoints. Existing approaches typically learn cross-view
correlations through direct feature similarity matching, often overlooking
semantic degradation caused by extreme viewpoint disparities. To address this
unique problem, we focus on robust feature retrieval under viewpoint variation
and propose the novel SkyLink method. We firstly utilize the Google Retrieval
Enhancement Module to perform data enhancement on street images, which
mitigates the occlusion of the key target due to restricted street viewpoints.
The Patch-Aware Feature Aggregation module is further adopted to emphasize
multiple local feature aggregations to ensure the consistent feature extraction
across viewpoints. Meanwhile, we integrate the 3D scene information constructed
from multi-scale UAV images as a bridge between street and satellite
viewpoints, and perform feature alignment through self-supervised and
cross-view contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate robustness
and generalization across diverse urban scenarios, which achieve 25.75$\%$
Recall@1 accuracy on University-1652 in the UAVM2025 Challenge. Code will be

*Shenghao Fu,Qize Yang,Yuan-Ming Li,Xihan Wei,Xiaohua Xie,Wei-Shi Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LOVE-R1, a video-language model designed for long video understanding. It employs an adaptive zoom-in mechanism for optimal temporal and spatial analysis, outperforming a baseline model on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing Large Video-Language Models (LVLMs), which struggle with balancing detailed spatial perception and long-term temporal understanding in long videos.

Method: The proposed LOVE-R1 model uses an adaptive zoom-in mechanism that starts with low-resolution dense frames and selectively increases resolution for specific clips to extract relevant details. This is trained using a combination of high-quality CoT data and a decoupled reinforcement finetuning process for improved reasoning.

Result: The LOVE-R1 model demonstrates an average improvement of 3.1% over the baseline Qwen2.5-VL across four long video understanding benchmarks, achieving a better balance between frame sampling density and resolution.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the LOVE-R1 model's adaptive frame sampling mechanism offers an effective solution for long video understanding, effectively addressing the trade-off issue and setting new benchmarks in performance.

Abstract: Long video understanding is still challenging for recent Large Video-Language
Models (LVLMs) due to the conflict between long-form temporal understanding and
detailed spatial perception. LVLMs with a uniform frame sampling mechanism,
which samples frames with an equal frame size and fixed sampling rate,
inevitably sacrifice either temporal clues or spatial details, resulting in
suboptimal solutions. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose LOVE-R1, a model
that can adaptively zoom in on a video clip. The model is first provided with
densely sampled frames but in a small resolution. If some spatial details are
needed, the model can zoom in on a clip of interest with a large frame
resolution based on its reasoning until key visual information is obtained. The
whole process is implemented as a multi-step reasoning process. To train the
reasoning ability, we first finetune the model on our collected 38k
high-quality CoT data and enhance it with decoupled reinforcement finetuning.
As outcome rewards can not provide fine-grained process supervision, we
decouple multi-step reasoning into multiple single-step reasoning and optimize
the internal zoom-in ability explicitly. Experiments on long video
understanding benchmarks show that our model with the slow-fast adaptive frame
sampling mechanism achieves a great trade-off between sampling density and
frame resolutions, and LOVE-R1 outperforms our baseline Qwen2.5-VL by an
average of 3.1% points across 4 common long video understanding benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and optimize how visual functions are processed within MLLMs, enabling improved efficiency and alignment with human-like patterns.

Method: The study uses Visual Token Swapping, a framework that modifies KV cache entries in targeted layers to analyze layer-specific functions during decoding.

Result: Selective training on Vision Function Layers (VFLs) improves model performance while reducing out-of-domain forgetting. VFL-select surpasses human experts in data categorization and achieves near full-data performance using only 20% of the dataset.

Conclusion: The findings improve understanding of MLLM visual processing and offer methods for creating efficient, interpretable, and robust models tailored to specific functions.

Abstract: This study identifies that visual-related functional decoding is distributed
across different decoder layers in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).
Typically, each function, such as counting, grounding, or OCR recognition,
narrows down to two or three layers, which we define as Vision Function Layers
(VFL). Additionally, the depth and its order of different VFLs exhibits a
consistent pattern across different MLLMs, which is well-aligned with human
behaviors (e.g., recognition occurs first, followed by counting, and then
grounding). These findings are derived from Visual Token Swapping, our novel
analytical framework that modifies targeted KV cache entries to precisely
elucidate layer-specific functions during decoding. Furthermore, these insights
offer substantial utility in tailoring MLLMs for real-world downstream
applications. For instance, when LoRA training is selectively applied to VFLs
whose functions align with the training data, VFL-LoRA not only outperform
full-LoRA but also prevent out-of-domain function forgetting. Moreover, by
analyzing the performance differential on training data when particular VFLs
are ablated, VFL-select automatically classifies data by function, enabling
highly efficient data selection to directly bolster corresponding capabilities.
Consequently, VFL-select surpasses human experts in data selection, and
achieves 98% of full-data performance with only 20% of the original dataset.
This study delivers deeper comprehension of MLLM visual processing, fostering
the creation of more efficient, interpretable, and robust models.

*Lei Tong,Zhihua Liu,Chaochao Lu,Dino Oglic,Tom Diethe,Philip Teare,Sotirios A. Tsaftaris,Chen Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Causal-Adapter is a method for adapting frozen text-to-image models to perform controlled counterfactual image generation using causal interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve controlled image editing by leveraging causal modeling to ensure accurate and meaningful attribute manipulation without compromising the core image identity.

Method: Introduces Causal-Adapter, combining structural causal modeling with two attribute regularization techniques: prompt-aligned injection and conditioned token contrastive loss.

Result: Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art results, reducing mean absolute error (MAE) by up to 91% and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) by up to 87% on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Causal-Adapter enables robust counterfactual editing with precise control of attributes and strong preservation of image identity, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: We present Causal-Adapter, a modular framework that adapts frozen
text-to-image diffusion backbones for counterfactual image generation. Our
method enables causal interventions on target attributes, consistently
propagating their effects to causal dependents without altering the core
identity of the image. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on prompt
engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages
structural causal modeling augmented with two attribute regularization
strategies: prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with
textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and a conditioned token
contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious
correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 91\% MAE reduction on Pendulum
for accurate attribute control and 87\% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity
MRI image generation. These results show that our approach enables robust,
generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and
strong identity preservation.

*Anirban Ghosh,Ayan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TACO-Net, a novel 3D object classification method combining topological data analysis and filtration techniques, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High classification accuracy for unordered, irregular, and noisy point clouds remains challenging despite advancements in deep learning.

Method: The method involves voxelizing point clouds into binary 3D images, extracting topological features, and training a lightweight 1D CNN for classification.

Result: TACO-Net achieves 99.05% and 99.52% accuracy on ModelNet40 and ModelNet10 benchmarks, respectively, and demonstrates robustness on OmniObject3D and corrupted inputs.

Conclusion: TACO-Net establishes a new state-of-the-art in 3D object classification, showcasing robustness and high precision across various datasets.

Abstract: 3D object classification is a crucial problem due to its significant
practical relevance in many fields, including computer vision, robotics, and
autonomous driving. Although deep learning methods applied to point clouds
sampled on CAD models of the objects and/or captured by LiDAR or RGBD cameras
have achieved remarkable success in recent years, achieving high classification
accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the unordered point clouds and
their irregularity and noise. To this end, we propose a novel state-of-the-art
(SOTA) 3D object classification technique that combines topological data
analysis with various image filtration techniques to classify objects when they
are represented using point clouds. We transform every point cloud into a
voxelized binary 3D image to extract distinguishing topological features. Next,
we train a lightweight one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN)
using the extracted feature set from the training dataset. Our framework,
TACO-Net, sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving $99.05\%$ and $99.52\%$
accuracy on the widely used synthetic benchmarks ModelNet40 and ModelNet10, and
further demonstrates its robustness on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D
dataset. When tested with ten different kinds of corrupted ModelNet40 inputs,
the proposed TACO-Net demonstrates strong resiliency overall.

*Zeyu Cai,Ziyang Li,Xiaoben Li,Boqian Li,Zeyu Wang,Zhenyu Zhang,Yuliang Xiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UP2You is a tuning-free solution for producing 3D clothed portraits from unstructured 2D photos, addressing issues like pose and occlusion variability, and surpassing prior methods in geometric accuracy and texture fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to solve the problem of creating 3D clothed portraits from unstructured 2D photos, which are often subject to occlusions, varied poses, and viewpoints, unlike existing methods that require clean input or calibrated setups.

Method: The method involves a data rectifier paradigm that converts irregular inputs into clean, orthogonal multi-view images. The system uses a pose-correlated feature aggregation module (PCFA) and a perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor, eliminating the need for pre-existing body templates.

Result: UP2You outperforms prior methods in both geometric precision and texture quality, achieving significant improvements in Chamfer (+15%), P2S (+18%), PSNR (+21%), and LPIPS (+46%) across various datasets. It is also computationally efficient, completing a reconstruction in 1.5 minutes.

Conclusion: UP2You is a practical and efficient approach for real-world 3D clothed portrait reconstruction, offering versatility like pose control and virtual try-on. It sets a benchmark for future exploration in this domain, with models and code being made publicly available to drive further research.

Abstract: We present UP2You, the first tuning-free solution for reconstructing
high-fidelity 3D clothed portraits from extremely unconstrained in-the-wild 2D
photos. Unlike previous approaches that require "clean" inputs (e.g., full-body
images with minimal occlusions, or well-calibrated cross-view captures), UP2You
directly processes raw, unstructured photographs, which may vary significantly
in pose, viewpoint, cropping, and occlusion. Instead of compressing data into
tokens for slow online text-to-3D optimization, we introduce a data rectifier
paradigm that efficiently converts unconstrained inputs into clean, orthogonal
multi-view images in a single forward pass within seconds, simplifying the 3D
reconstruction. Central to UP2You is a pose-correlated feature aggregation
module (PCFA), that selectively fuses information from multiple reference
images w.r.t. target poses, enabling better identity preservation and nearly
constant memory footprint, with more observations. We also introduce a
perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor, removing the need for
pre-captured body templates. Extensive experiments on 4D-Dress, PuzzleIOI, and
in-the-wild captures demonstrate that UP2You consistently surpasses previous
methods in both geometric accuracy (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and
texture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress). UP2You is efficient (1.5
minutes per person), and versatile (supports arbitrary pose control, and
training-free multi-garment 3D virtual try-on), making it practical for
real-world scenarios where humans are casually captured. Both models and code
will be released to facilitate future research on this underexplored task.

### [644] [Training-Free Token Pruning via Zeroth-Order Gradient Estimation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24837)
*Youngeun Kim,Youjia Zhang,Huiling Liu,Aecheon Jung,Sunwoo Lee,Sungeun Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a training-free token pruning framework, \ours, to improve the efficiency of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs face heavy inference costs due to redundant visual tokens, and current token pruning methods are either unstable or inefficient.

Method: The proposed framework (
ours) estimates token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at the projection layer, identifying influential tokens based on lightweight forward passes.

Result: \ours significantly reduces the number of tokens (up to 94.4%) while maintaining accuracy and improving inference efficiency by up to 2.30x.

Conclusion: \ours enhances the efficiency of VLMs by effectively pruning redundant tokens, outperforming prior methods in both token reduction and computational speed.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable strong multimodal reasoning but
incur heavy inference costs from redundant visual tokens. Token pruning
alleviates this issue, yet existing approaches face limitations.
Attention-based methods rely on raw attention scores, which are often unstable
across layers and heads and can lead to redundant selections. Diversity-based
methods improve robustness by selecting tokens far apart in feature space but
risk dropping regions needed for accurate prediction. We propose \ours, a
training-free framework built on a simple intuition: tokens with higher
sensitivity are more likely to influence the model's output, and they should
also capture complementary visual cues rather than overlapping information. To
achieve this, we estimate token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at
the projection layer, a shallow and computationally light component of the
model. This approach measures how small random perturbations affect the
projection outputs, allowing us to approximate each token's influence through
lightweight forward passes without backpropagation. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLMs and benchmarks show that \ours consistently outperforms
prior methods, pruning up to 94.4\% of tokens while maintaining accuracy and
significantly improving efficiency, achieving up to 2.30x faster end-to-end
inference over the baseline.

*Bo Zhao,Dan Guo,Junzhe Cao,Yong Xu,Tao Tan,Yue Sun,Bochao Zou,Jie Zhang,Zitong Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PHASE-Net, a physics-informed model for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), offering enhanced accuracy and efficiency in non-contact physiological monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) struggles with accuracy under head motion and lighting changes. Existing deep learning solutions lack theoretical grounding, limiting robustness and interpretability.

Method: The authors derive a physics-based rPPG paradigm from Navier-Stokes equations, proposing PHASE-Net with three innovations: axial channel swapping, adaptive spatial filtering, and a gated Temporal Convolutional Network for pulse recovery.

Result: PHASE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong efficiency and accuracy in non-contact physiological monitoring.

Conclusion: The model provides a robust, theoretically grounded, and deployment-ready solution for remote pulse signal measurement.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) measurement enables non-contact
physiological monitoring but suffers from accuracy degradation under head
motion and illumination changes. Existing deep learning methods are mostly
heuristic and lack theoretical grounding, which limits robustness and
interpretability. In this work, we propose a physics-informed rPPG paradigm
derived from the Navier-Stokes equations of hemodynamics, showing that the
pulse signal follows a second-order dynamical system whose discrete solution
naturally leads to a causal convolution. This provides a theoretical
justification for using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Based on this
principle, we design PHASE-Net, a lightweight model with three key components:
(1) Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper module, which swaps or transposes a few spatial
channels to mix distant facial regions and enhance cross-region feature
interaction without breaking temporal order; (2) Adaptive Spatial Filter, which
learns a soft spatial mask per frame to highlight signal-rich areas and
suppress noise; and (3) Gated TCN, a causal dilated TCN with gating that models
long-range temporal dynamics for accurate pulse recovery. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PHASE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong
efficiency, offering a theoretically grounded and deployment-ready rPPG
solution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces ELPG-DTFS, a graph neural network model for EEG-based screening of major depressive disorder, achieving high accuracy and interpretability by utilizing neuroscience priors and adaptive features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MDD diagnosis methods are subjective, and existing EEG-based models have limitations in treating spectra as static and neglecting prior knowledge.

Method: ELPG-DTFS incorporates a channel-band attention mechanism, a dynamic functional graph through a learnable adjacency matrix, and includes neuroscience priors using a residual pathway.

Result: The model achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1 score on the MODMA dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art ACM-GNN model. Ablation studies confirm the importance of each module.

Conclusion: ELPG-DTFS provides a highly accurate and interpretable framework for EEG-based MDD diagnostics, paving the way for better diagnostic systems.

Abstract: Timely and objective screening of major depressive disorder (MDD) is vital,
yet diagnosis still relies on subjective scales. Electroencephalography (EEG)
provides a low-cost biomarker, but existing deep models treat spectra as static
images, fix inter-channel graphs, and ignore prior knowledge, limiting accuracy
and interpretability. We propose ELPG-DTFS, a prior-guided adaptive
time-frequency graph neural network that introduces: (1) channel-band attention
with cross-band mutual information, (2) a learnable adjacency matrix for
dynamic functional links, and (3) a residual knowledge-graph pathway injecting
neuroscience priors. On the 128-channel MODMA dataset (53 subjects), ELPG-DTFS
achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1, surpassing the 2025 state-of-the-art
ACM-GNN. Ablation shows that removing any module lowers F1 by up to 4.35,
confirming their complementary value. ELPG-DTFS thus offers a robust and
interpretable framework for next-generation EEG-based MDD diagnostics.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG)-based preprocessing to improve semantic segmentation robustness under challenging visual conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance robustness in semantic segmentation models under adverse visual conditions like night, fog, and snow, drawing inspiration from human visual system mechanisms.

Method: Applies Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) filters to various image channels (RGB, grayscale, opponent-color) for preprocessing, while keeping the model architecture and training unchanged.

Result: The preprocessing maintains accuracy on regular datasets and significantly improves performance in adverse imaging conditions across datasets like Cityscapes, ACDC, and Dark Zurich.

Conclusion: The lightweight, model-agnostic preprocessing can be integrated into imaging pipelines for robust semantic segmentation in safety-critical vision tasks.

Abstract: Inspired by the human visual system's mechanisms for contrast enhancement and
color-opponency, we explore biologically motivated input preprocessing for
robust semantic segmentation. By applying Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG)
filtering to RGB, grayscale, and opponent-color channels, we enhance local
contrast without modifying model architecture or training. Evaluations on
Cityscapes, ACDC, and Dark Zurich show that such preprocessing maintains
in-distribution performance while improving robustness to adverse conditions
like night, fog, and snow. As this processing is model-agnostic and
lightweight, it holds potential for integration into imaging pipelines,
enabling imaging systems to deliver task-ready, robust inputs for downstream
vision models in safety-critical environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces StreamForest, a novel architecture for streaming video understanding, focusing on efficiency and real-time analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address challenges in real-time streaming video understanding caused by storage limitations of historical data and inadequate spatiotemporal reasoning.

Method: They developed StreamForest featuring the Persistent Event Memory Forest and Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window for efficient long-term memory and real-time perception, alongside introducing new datasets: OnlineIT and ODV-Bench.

Result: StreamForest achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, maintaining high accuracy even under extreme token compression scenarios.

Conclusion: StreamForest proves to be robust, efficient, and generalizable for real-time streaming video understanding, establishing its practical applicability.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, their effectiveness in real-time
streaming scenarios remains limited due to storage constraints of historical
visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamForest, a novel architecture specifically
designed for streaming video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the
Persistent Event Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes
video frames into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided
by penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge
frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under limited
computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we introduce a
Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed short-term visual
cues to improve current scene perception. Additionally, we present OnlineIT, an
instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT
significantly boosts MLLM performance in both real-time perception and future
prediction. To evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce
ODV-Bench, a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video understanding
in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that
StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of
77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. In
particular, even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024
tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average accuracy in eight benchmarks
relative to the default setting. These results underscore the robustness,
efficiency, and generalizability of StreamForest for streaming video
understanding.

*Nikos Kostagiolas,Pantelis Georgiades,Yannis Panagakis,Mihalis A. Nicolaou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel diffusion model for generating satellite images conditioned on environmental context using text, metadata, and visual data. It addresses prior limitations such as limited context, corrupted data handling, and user intention misrepresentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to overcome limitations of existing diffusion-based generative models for remote sensing, including reliance on limited environmental context, poor handling of corrupted or missing data, and inability to reflect user intentions accurately.

Method: The proposed method incorporates environmental context as dynamic control signals (text, metadata, visual data) into the diffusion model and uses a metadata fusion strategy to handle partially corrupt or missing data.

Result: The model demonstrated superior performance over existing methods, achieving improved fidelity, accuracy, and quality across six metrics in both single-image and temporal generation tasks. It also showed robustness in handling missing metadata and stronger responsiveness to control inputs.

Conclusion: Conditioning generative models on environmental context can significantly improve satellite imagery performance and the approach is a promising candidate for downstream applications. Moreover, the paper introduces the first publicly available 3-modal dataset for environmental context.

Abstract: Diffusion-based foundation models have recently garnered much attention in
the field of generative modeling due to their ability to generate images of
high quality and fidelity. Although not straightforward, their recent
application to the field of remote sensing signaled the first successful trials
towards harnessing the large volume of publicly available datasets containing
multimodal information. Despite their success, existing methods face
considerable limitations: they rely on limited environmental context, struggle
with missing or corrupted data, and often fail to reliably reflect user
intentions in generated outputs. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion
model conditioned on environmental context, that is able to generate satellite
images by conditioning from any combination of three different control signals:
a) text, b) metadata, and c) visual data. In contrast to previous works, the
proposed method is i) to our knowledge, the first of its kind to condition
satellite image generation on dynamic environmental conditions as part of its
control signals, and ii) incorporating a metadata fusion strategy that models
attribute embedding interactions to account for partially corrupt and/or
missing observations. Our method outperforms previous methods both
qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control
inputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality of
generations measured using 6 different metrics) in the trials of single-image
and temporal generation. The reported results support our hypothesis that
conditioning on environmental context can improve the performance of foundation
models for satellite imagery, and render our model a promising candidate for
usage in downstream tasks. The collected 3-modal dataset is to our knowledge,
the first publicly-available dataset to combine data from these three different
mediums.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Severe class imbalance in vehicle recognition datasets is addressed by creating a 16-class corpus with balanced variants, benchmarking lightweight ensembles and a deep CNN. The CNN outperforms ensembles but struggles with under-represented classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance vehicle type recognition, which suffers from performance suppression on rare categories due to dataset class imbalances, particularly in public datasets.

Method: Created a 16-class corpus (~47k images) merging multiple data sources, balanced the data using SMOTE and undersampling, and compared ensemble methods (Random Forest, AdaBoost) and a ResNet-style CNN with augmentation and label smoothing.

Result: The CNN achieved superior accuracy (79.19% on the test set, 81.25% on an unseen batch), outperforming ensembles, but failed on the most under-represented class (Barge).

Conclusion: Deep models like CNN show promise for vehicle recognition but need improved strategies for handling extreme data imbalance, suggesting emphasis on expanding rare-class data and hybrid methodologies.

Abstract: Accurate vehicle type recognition underpins intelligent transportation and
logistics, but severe class imbalance in public datasets suppresses performance
on rare categories. We curate a 16-class corpus (~47k images) by merging
Kaggle, ImageNet, and web-crawled data, and create six balanced variants via
SMOTE oversampling and targeted undersampling. Lightweight ensembles, such as
Random Forest, AdaBoost, and a soft-voting combiner built on MobileNet-V2
features are benchmarked against a configurable ResNet-style CNN trained with
strong augmentation and label smoothing. The best ensemble (SMOTE-combined)
attains 74.8% test accuracy, while the CNN achieves 79.19% on the full test set
and 81.25% on an unseen inference batch, confirming the advantage of deep
models. Nonetheless, the most under-represented class (Barge) remains a failure
mode, highlighting the limits of rebalancing alone. Results suggest
prioritizing additional minority-class collection and cost-sensitive objectives
(e.g., focal loss) and exploring hybrid ensemble or CNN pipelines to combine
interpretability with representational power.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VagueGAN, an attack pipeline for generative models like GANs and diffusion models, using stealthy perturbations to manipulate outputs while maintaining or enhancing image aesthetics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explores the gap in research on adversarial attacks targeting generative pipelines, aiming to highlight vulnerabilities in image generation systems.

Method: Proposed VagueGAN uses a modular PoisonerNet combined with a Generator-Discriminator pair to craft stealthy triggers, evaluated with custom metrics for attack efficacy and perceptual measures for stealth.

Result: Finds that poisoned outputs can lead to higher visual quality, showcasing the potential for latent space poisoning to enhance aesthetics and bypass existing defenses.

Conclusion: Latent space poisoning poses a significant threat to the integrity of image generation pipelines, calling for new defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Generative models such as GANs and diffusion models are widely used to
synthesize photorealistic images and to support downstream creative and editing
tasks. While adversarial attacks on discriminative models are well studied,
attacks targeting generative pipelines where small, stealthy perturbations in
inputs lead to controlled changes in outputs are less explored. This study
introduces VagueGAN, an attack pipeline combining a modular perturbation
network PoisonerNet with a Generator Discriminator pair to craft stealthy
triggers that cause targeted changes in generated images. Attack efficacy is
evaluated using a custom proxy metric, while stealth is analyzed through
perceptual and frequency domain measures. The transferability of the method to
a modern diffusion based pipeline is further examined through ControlNet guided
editing. Interestingly, the experiments show that poisoned outputs can display
higher visual quality compared to clean counterparts, challenging the
assumption that poisoning necessarily reduces fidelity. Unlike conventional
pixel level perturbations, latent space poisoning in GANs and diffusion
pipelines can retain or even enhance output aesthetics, exposing a blind spot
in pixel level defenses. Moreover, carefully optimized perturbations can
produce consistent, stealthy effects on generator outputs while remaining
visually inconspicuous, raising concerns for the integrity of image generation
pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes DWGS, a framework to improve sparse view synthesis by enhancing 3D Gaussian Splatting with structural cues, virtual views, and occlusion reconstruction. The method achieves improved metrics while keeping real-time inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse view synthesis continues to suffer from issues like overfitting, geometric distortion, and incomplete reconstructions due to limited multi-view constraints. Current approaches like 3D Gaussian Splatting face challenges in structural consistency and artifacts.

Method: DWGS integrates three components: Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation for multi-view consistency, Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis for stronger geometric and photometric constraints, and Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction to recover hidden regions.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks show new state-of-the-art results with metrics like 21.13 dB PSNR and 0.189 LPIPS along with real-time inference capabilities.

Conclusion: DWGS provides efficient improvements in sparse view synthesis by addressing structural inconsistencies and occlusions, pushing the boundaries in both fidelity and real-time performance.

Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) from sparse views remains a core challenge in 3D
reconstruction, typically suffering from overfitting, geometric distortion, and
incomplete scene recovery due to limited multi-view constraints. Although 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time, high-fidelity rendering, it
suffers from floating artifacts and structural inconsistencies under
sparse-input settings. To address these issues, we propose DWGS, a novel
unified framework that enhances 3DGS for sparse-view synthesis by integrating
robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region
completion. Our approach introduces three principal contributions: a
Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that leverages dense matching priors with
reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints to enforce
multi-view consistency; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method
generates virtual training views to impose stronger geometric and photometric
constraints; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that utilizes
depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model to recover obscured
regions. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (LLFF, Blender, and DTU)
show that DWGS achieves a new state-of-the-art, achieving up to 21.13 dB PSNR
and 0.189 LPIPS, while retaining real-time inference capabilities.

*Xi Chen,Hongxun Yao,Zhaopan Xu,Kui Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method, DAM, to improve source-free active domain adaptation using multimodal supervision and bidirectional distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional domain adaptation methods lack effective fusion of vision-language models and manual labels in source-free setups, limiting performance.

Method: Proposes the DAM framework, utilizing vision-language models for multimodal supervision and bidirectional knowledge transfer during adaptation.

Result: DAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks and active learning strategies in source-free active domain adaptation.

Conclusion: The DAM framework successfully improves adaptation accuracy by integrating multimodal supervision and dual learning exchange mechanisms.

Abstract: Source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA) enhances knowledge transfer from
a source model to an unlabeled target domain using limited manual labels
selected via active learning. While recent domain adaptation studies have
introduced Vision-and-Language (ViL) models to improve pseudo-label quality or
feature alignment, they often treat ViL-based and data supervision as separate
sources, lacking effective fusion. To overcome this limitation, we propose Dual
Active learning with Multimodal (DAM) foundation model, a novel framework that
integrates multimodal supervision from a ViL model to complement sparse human
annotations, thereby forming a dual supervisory signal. DAM initializes stable
ViL-guided targets and employs a bidirectional distillation mechanism to foster
mutual knowledge exchange between the target model and the dual supervisions
during iterative adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAM
consistently outperforms existing methods and sets a new state-of-the-art
across multiple SFADA benchmarks and active learning strategies.

Method: The framework leverages HRNet and Swin-Transformer modules with biomechanical constraints and SVD analysis on radiographic data.

Result: Achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy, a 2.55° mean absolute error, and introduced the Vertebral Wedging Index (VWI) with prognostic correlation.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables accurate AIS severity prediction and progression monitoring, offering improvements over traditional measures.

Abstract: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common spinal deformity affecting
approximately 2.2% of boys and 4.8% of girls worldwide. The Cobb angle serves
as the gold standard for AIS severity assessment, yet traditional manual
measurements suffer from significant observer variability, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. Despite prior automation attempts, existing methods use
simplified spinal models and predetermined curve patterns that fail to address
clinical complexity. We present a novel deep learning framework for AIS
assessment that simultaneously predicts both superior and inferior endplate
angles with corresponding midpoint coordinates for each vertebra, preserving
the anatomical reality of vertebral wedging in progressive AIS. Our approach
combines an HRNet backbone with Swin-Transformer modules and biomechanically
informed constraints for enhanced feature extraction. We employ Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to analyze angle predictions directly from vertebral
morphology, enabling flexible detection of diverse scoliosis patterns without
predefined curve assumptions. Using 630 full-spine anteroposterior radiographs
from patients aged 10-18 years with rigorous dual-rater annotation, our method
achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55{\deg} mean absolute error. The
framework demonstrates exceptional generalization capability on
out-of-distribution cases. Additionally, we introduce the Vertebral Wedging
Index (VWI), a novel metric quantifying vertebral deformation. Longitudinal
analysis revealed VWI's significant prognostic correlation with curve
progression while traditional Cobb angles showed no correlation, providing
robust support for early AIS detection, personalized treatment planning, and
progression monitoring.

*Mohsen Ghafoorian,Denis Korzhenkov,Amirhossein Habibian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Attention Surgery," a framework that helps pretrained video diffusion models reduce computational costs of attention by up to 40% while retaining quality using a hybrid softmax-linear approach and lightweight adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based video diffusion models achieve excellent video generation quality but face computational difficulties with long sequences and high resolutions due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention.

Method: The framework introduces a hybrid attention mechanism mixing softmax and linear tokens, paired with lightweight distillation and fine-tuning processes that require minimal computational resources. It also incorporates a cost-aware strategy to balance efficiency and expressiveness.

Result: Applying this method to a state-of-the-art video diffusion model (Wan2.1 1.3B), Attention Surgery achieved competitive video quality benchmarks while reducing attention computational costs by up to 40%.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enables pretrained video diffusion models to achieve lower computational costs without sacrificing their generation quality.

Abstract: Transformer-based video diffusion models (VDMs) deliver state-of-the-art
video generation quality but are constrained by the quadratic cost of
self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally
expensive. While linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity, prior
attempts fail to match the expressiveness of softmax attention without costly
retraining. We introduce \textit{Attention Surgery}, an efficient framework for
\textit{linearizing} or \textit{hybridizing} attention in pretrained VDMs
without training from scratch. Inspired by recent advances in language models,
our method combines a novel hybrid attention mechanism-mixing softmax and
linear tokens-with a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline
requiring only a few GPU-days. Additionally, we incorporate a cost-aware
block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers.
Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B, a state-of-the-art DiT-based VDM, Attention Surgery
achieves the first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models,
reducing attention cost by up to 40\% in terms of FLOPs, while maintaining
generation quality as measured on the standard VBench and VBench-2.0
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OpenGPT-4o-Image, a large-scale dataset designed to address deficiencies in training data for multimodal models, significantly improving model performance on image editing and generation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current datasets for image generation and editing lack the structure and complexity needed for real-world applications.

Method: A novel hierarchical task taxonomy and automated data generation pipeline are used to create 80k high-quality instruction-image pairs across 11 domains and 51 subtasks.

Result: Fine-tuning models on this dataset led to 18% improvement on editing tasks and 13% improvement on generation tasks across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Systematic construction of diverse and comprehensive datasets is crucial for advancing multimodal AI capabilities.

Abstract: The performance of unified multimodal models for image generation and editing
is fundamentally constrained by the quality and comprehensiveness of their
training data. While existing datasets have covered basic tasks like style
transfer and simple object manipulation, they often lack the systematic
structure and challenging scenarios required for real-world applications. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce OpenGPT-4o-Image, a large-scale dataset
constructed using a novel methodology that combines hierarchical task taxonomy
with automated data generation. Our taxonomy not only includes fundamental
capabilities such as text rendering and style control but also introduces
highly practical yet challenging categories like scientific imagery for
chemistry illustrations and complex instruction editing requiring simultaneous
execution of multiple operations. Through an automated pipeline leveraging
structured resource pools and GPT-4o, we generate 80k high-quality
instruction-image pairs with controlled diversity, covering 11 major domains
and 51 subtasks. Extensive experiments show that fine-tuning leading models on
our dataset achieves significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks,
with improvements of up to 18\% on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench)
and 13% on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval). Our work demonstrates that
systematic data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SID, a self-improving learning approach for language-guided navigation, which iteratively enhances exploration and generalization. SID significantly outperforms existing techniques in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current goal-oriented language-guided navigation methods lack robust exploration priors, as they rely mostly on shortest-path trajectories, which limits their ability to train effective navigation agents.

Method: SID starts by training agents using shortest-path data and then iteratively generates exploratory trajectories through this initial agent. These new rollouts serve as improved demonstrations for further training, creating a self-improving loop.

Result: SID's iterative process enhances exploration and generalization significantly, achieving new state-of-the-art performance in REVERIE and SOON tasks. For instance, it achieved a 50.9% success rate on SOON's unseen validation splits, 13.9% better than existing methods.

Conclusion: The SID approach presents a scalable and transferable pipeline for improving navigation agents in goal-oriented tasks, elevating the performance ceiling and setting new benchmarks in the field.

Abstract: Goal-oriented language-guided navigation requires robust exploration
capabilities for agents to navigate to specified goals in unknown environments
without step-by-step instructions. Existing methods tend to exclusively utilize
shortest-path trajectories, lacking effective exploration priors for training
navigation agents. To address the above challenges, we present SID, a
goal-oriented language-guided navigation learning approach with Self-Improving
Demonstrations. Specifically, SID learns an initial agent on the shortest-path
data sampled from environments and then leverages this agent to generate novel
exploration trajectories. The novel rollouts provide demonstrations with
stronger exploration strategies to train a better agent, which in turn produces
higher-quality agent demonstrations for the next round of training. We show
that this iterative self-improving pipeline readily scales to new environments,
and the resulting demonstrations can be transferred across a variety of
language-guided navigation tasks, elevating the performance ceiling in diverse
goal-oriented navigation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SID
significantly boosts the exploration capabilities and generalization of
navigation agents. The resulting agent achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on goal-oriented language-guided navigation tasks, including
REVERIE, SOON, notably achieving a 50.9% success rate on the unseen validation
splits of SOON, surpassing the prior leading approaches by a margin of 13.9%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seg-CFT is a method for generating realistic, locally coherent, and structure-specific counterfactual images without requiring hypothetical pixel-level segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address current limitations in counterfactual image generation by providing a method that locally modifies specific structures in an image without introducing undesirable global effects.

Method: Introduce Seg-CFT, which combines scalar-valued structure-specific interventions with a novel fine-tuning approach guided by segmentors for local and effective counterfactual generation.

Result: Demonstrate the ability of Seg-CFT to produce realistic and effective counterfactual chest radiographs, with promising applications in disease modeling, particularly coronary artery disease.

Conclusion: Seg-CFT simplifies the process of generating locally-coherent counterfactuals, enhancing potential applications in medical imaging and dataset modifications.

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation is a powerful tool for augmenting training
data, de-biasing datasets, and modeling disease. Current approaches rely on
external classifiers or regressors to increase the effectiveness of
subject-level interventions (e.g., changing the patient's age). For
structure-specific interventions (e.g., changing the area of the left lung in a
chest radiograph), we show that this is insufficient, and can result in
undesirable global effects across the image domain. Previous work used
pixel-level label maps as guidance, requiring a user to provide hypothetical
segmentations which are tedious and difficult to obtain. We propose
Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT), which preserves the
simplicity of intervening on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while
producing locally coherent and effective counterfactuals. We demonstrate the
capability of generating realistic chest radiographs, and we show promising
results for modeling coronary artery disease. Code:

*Sangeek Hyun,MinKyu Lee,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores scaling principles for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by introducing transformer-based architectures and latent-space training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore scalability principles for GANs, given their limited study in comparison to other generative models.

Method: The authors propose training GANs in a Variational Autoencoder latent space combined with transformer-based generators and discriminators, addressing scalability issues with intermediate supervision and learning-rate adjustment.

Result: The proposed GAT model demonstrated reliable training across different capacities and achieved state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-256 in significantly fewer epochs.

Conclusion: Scalability enhancements and tailored solutions enable GANs to efficiently train at large scales with competitive performance.

Abstract: Scalability has driven recent advances in generative modeling, yet its
principles remain underexplored for adversarial learning. We investigate the
scalability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through two design
choices that have proven to be effective in other types of generative models:
training in a compact Variational Autoencoder latent space and adopting purely
transformer-based generators and discriminators. Training in latent space
enables efficient computation while preserving perceptual fidelity, and this
efficiency pairs naturally with plain transformers, whose performance scales
with computational budget. Building on these choices, we analyze failure modes
that emerge when naively scaling GANs. Specifically, we find issues as
underutilization of early layers in the generator and optimization instability
as the network scales. Accordingly, we provide simple and scale-friendly
solutions as lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate
adjustment. Our experiments show that GAT, a purely transformer-based and
latent-space GANs, can be easily trained reliably across a wide range of
capacities (S through XL). Moreover, GAT-XL/2 achieves state-of-the-art
single-step, class-conditional generation performance (FID of 2.96) on
ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs, 6x fewer epochs than strong baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CogniGPT, a framework using an interactive loop between Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) and Verification-Enhanced Reflection Agent (VERA) for efficient long video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of understanding temporally complex long videos with sparse task-relevant information, where existing LLM-based approaches struggle with both completeness and efficiency.

Method: CogniGPT utilizes MGPA to mimic human visual cognition for capturing information and VERA to verify key clues, mitigating hallucination and optimizing perception strategies through an interactive process.

Result: Experiments across datasets (EgoSchema, Video-MME, NExT-QA, MovieChat) show CogniGPT's superiority in accuracy and efficiency, using significantly fewer frames while achieving comparable or better performance.

Conclusion: CogniGPT provides an efficient, reliable framework for long video understanding, leveraging minimal task-relevant clues while outperforming or matching existing methods in accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Long videos, characterized by temporal complexity and sparse task-relevant
information, pose significant reasoning challenges for AI systems. Although
various Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have advanced long video
understanding, they still struggle to achieve both completeness and efficiency
in capturing task-critical information. Inspired by human progressive visual
cognition, we propose CogniGPT, a framework that leverages an interactive loop
between Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) and Verification-Enhanced
Reflection Agent (VERA) for efficient and reliable long video understanding.
Specifically, MGPA mimics human visual divergent and focused attention to
capture task-related information, while VERA verifies perceived key clues to
mitigate hallucination and optimize subsequent perception strategies. Through
this interactive process, CogniGPT explores a minimal set of informative and
reliable task-related clues. Extensive experiments on EgoSchema, Video-MME,
NExT-QA, and MovieChat datasets demonstrate CogniGPT's superiority in both
accuracy and efficiency. Notably, on EgoSchema, it surpasses existing
training-free methods using only 11.2 frames and achieves performance
comparable to Gemini 1.5-Pro.

*Ankur Chanda,Kushan Choudhury,Shubhrodeep Roy,Shubhajit Biswas,Somenath Kuiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Temperature Scaling (TS) significantly improves calibration and confidence of CNNs for noisy brain tumor classification without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable confidence estimation is crucial in medical imaging to prevent overconfident misclassifications, particularly given the life-altering consequences of errors.

Method: A custom CNN was trained on brain MRI data and subjected to real-world noise (e.g., Gaussian, Poisson, etc.). TS was applied post-hoc for calibration, and performance metrics were analyzed pre- and post-calibration.

Result: TS achieved lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Negative Log-likelihood (NLL) across all noise conditions while maintaining the classification accuracy of the CNN.

Conclusion: Temperature Scaling is a computationally efficient method that enhances confidence estimation in medical AI, making it more reliable under various noisy conditions.

Abstract: Precise confidence estimation in deep learning is vital for high-stakes
fields like medical imaging, where overconfident misclassifications can have
serious consequences. This work evaluates the effectiveness of Temperature
Scaling (TS), a post-hoc calibration technique, in improving the reliability of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for brain tumor classification. We develop
a custom CNN and train it on a merged brain MRI dataset. To simulate real-world
uncertainty, five types of image noise are introduced: Gaussian, Poisson, Salt
& Pepper, Speckle, and Uniform. Model performance is evaluated using precision,
recall, F1-score, accuracy, negative log-likelihood (NLL), and expected
calibration error (ECE), both before and after calibration. Results demonstrate
that TS significantly reduces ECE and NLL under all noise conditions without
degrading classification accuracy. This underscores TS as an effective and
computationally efficient approach to enhance decision confidence of medical AI
systems, hence making model outputs more reliable in noisy or uncertain
settings.

*Ermanno Bartoli,Dennis Rotondi,Buwei He,Patric Jensfelt,Kai O. Arras,Iolanda Leite*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Social 3D Scene Graphs, which incorporate humans and their relationships with the environment into 3D Scene Graphs, enabling improved scene understanding for social robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance robots' interaction by improving their social compliance and context awareness, addressing the gap in capturing human-environment relationships in current 3D Scene Graphs.

Method: The authors propose Social 3D Scene Graphs—a new 3D Scene Graph representation that integrates human attributes, activities, and relationships using an open-vocabulary framework. They also develop a benchmark to evaluate the system using synthetic environments with annotated human-scene relationships.

Result: The introduced representation demonstrated improved performance in predicting human activities and reasoning about their relationship with the environment.

Conclusion: Social 3D Scene Graphs enhance the understanding of human activity and interaction in 3D environments, contributing to the development of socially intelligent robots.

Abstract: Understanding how people interact with their surroundings and each other is
essential for enabling robots to act in socially compliant and context-aware
ways. While 3D Scene Graphs have emerged as a powerful semantic representation
for scene understanding, existing approaches largely ignore humans in the
scene, also due to the lack of annotated human-environment relationships.
Moreover, existing methods typically capture only open-vocabulary relations
from single image frames, which limits their ability to model long-range
interactions beyond the observed content. We introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs,
an augmented 3D Scene Graph representation that captures humans, their
attributes, activities and relationships in the environment, both local and
remote, using an open-vocabulary framework. Furthermore, we introduce a new
benchmark consisting of synthetic environments with comprehensive human-scene
relationship annotations and diverse types of queries for evaluating social
scene understanding in 3D. The experiments demonstrate that our representation
improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment
relations, paving the way toward socially intelligent robots.

*Donghwa Kang,Junho Kim,Dongwoo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of facial keypoint alignment using event cameras, presenting a framework that integrates RGB data through cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) and leverages self-supervised learning for event data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB facial keypoint alignment methods underperform on event data, and limited spatial information and lack of labeled event datasets hinder progress.

Method: A novel framework combining cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) for integrating RGB data and self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) for effective feature extraction from unlabeled event data.

Result: Experiments on real and synthetic event datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a robust solution for event-based facial keypoint alignment, leveraging cross-modal and self-supervised techniques to address existing challenges.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages for facial keypoint alignment under
challenging conditions, such as low light and rapid motion, due to their high
temporal resolution and robustness to varying illumination. However, existing
RGB facial keypoint alignment methods do not perform well on event data, and
training solely on event data often leads to suboptimal performance because of
its limited spatial information. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive labeled
event datasets further hinders progress in this area. To address these issues,
we propose a novel framework based on cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) and
self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) for event-based
facial keypoint alignment. Our framework employs CMFA to integrate
corresponding RGB data, guiding the model to extract robust facial features
from event input images. In parallel, SSMER enables effective feature learning
from unlabeled event data, overcoming spatial limitations. Extensive
experiments on our real-event E-SIE dataset and a synthetic-event version of
the public WFLW-V benchmark show that our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: The paper tackles glioma segmentation across diverse treatment timelines, utilizing on-the-fly augmentation with GANs to improve model robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create robust segmentation models for glioma scans across different stages of treatment while overcoming limitations in diverse annotated data availability.

Method: Proposed an on-the-fly augmentation strategy using pretrained generative adversarial networks (GliGANs) to dynamically insert synthetic tumors during training, evaluating three nnU-Net-based models and their ensemble.

Result: Achieved high Dice scores across multiple glioma segmentation metrics and ranked first in the BraTS Lighthouse Challenge 2025 Task 1.

Conclusion: The proposed approach allows dynamic augmentation, overcoming storage and computational challenges, and successfully enhances segmentation precision in glioma scans.

Abstract: Robust segmentation across both pre-treatment and post-treatment glioma scans
can be helpful for consistent tumor monitoring and treatment planning. BraTS
2025 Task 1 addresses this by challenging models to generalize across varying
tumor appearances throughout the treatment timeline. However, training such
generalized models requires access to diverse, high-quality annotated data,
which is often limited. While data augmentation can alleviate this, storing
large volumes of augmented 3D data is computationally expensive. To address
these challenges, we propose an on-the-fly augmentation strategy that
dynamically inserts synthetic tumors using pretrained generative adversarial
networks (GliGANs) during training. We evaluate three nnU-Net-based models and
their ensembles: (1) a baseline without external augmentation, (2) a regular
on-the-fly augmented model, and (3) a model with customized on-the-fly
augmentation. Built upon the nnU-Net framework, our pipeline leverages
pretrained GliGAN weights and tumor insertion methods from prior
challenge-winning solutions. An ensemble of the three models achieves
lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.79 (ET), 0.749 (NETC), 0.872 (RC), 0.825 (SNFH),
0.79 (TC), and 0.88 (WT) on the online BraTS 2025 validation platform. This
work ranked first in the BraTS Lighthouse Challenge 2025 Task 1- Adult Glioma

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance the visual quality of RGBA video generation, which is limited in current methods, to increase its practical usability across applications.

Method: Develops a framework involving a variational autoencoder (VAE) that integrates alpha channels into the RGB latent space along with training a diffusion transformer. Additionally, the authors construct a diverse high-quality RGBA video dataset.

Result: The proposed 'Wan-Alpha' model achieves superior performance in visual aspects like quality, motion realism, and transparency rendering, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Wan-Alpha successfully generates realistic transparent videos, offering improvements in rendering fine-grained details and semi-transparent effects, contributing to better visual realism for RGBA videos.

Abstract: RGBA video generation, which includes an alpha channel to represent
transparency, is gaining increasing attention across a wide range of
applications. However, existing methods often neglect visual quality, limiting
their practical usability. In this paper, we propose \textit{Wan-Alpha}, a new
framework that generates transparent videos by learning both RGB and alpha
channels jointly. We design an effective variational autoencoder (VAE) that
encodes the alpha channel into the RGB latent space. Then, to support the
training of our diffusion transformer, we construct a high-quality and diverse
RGBA video dataset. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our model
demonstrates superior performance in visual quality, motion realism, and
transparency rendering. Notably, our model can generate a wide variety of
semi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine-grained details such as
hair strands. The released model is available on our website:

*Shuang Liang,Jing He,Chuanmeizhi Wang,Lejun Liao,Guo Zhang,Yingcong Chen,Yuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'SDPose,' a fine-tuning framework leveraging Stable Diffusion for human pose estimation, achieving state-of-the-art results and robust cross-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underutilized potential of pre-trained diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, for structured output tasks like human pose estimation while addressing cross-domain generalization and robustness.

Method: The authors propose SDPose, which uses Stable Diffusion's U-Net to predict keypoint heatmaps directly within the latent space, coupled with a lightweight convolutional pose head. The method also includes an auxiliary RGB reconstruction branch for domain-robustness and constructs a style-transferred dataset, COCO-OOD, for evaluation.

Result: SDPose achieves parity with state-of-the-art models like Sapiens on the COCO validation set with reduced training. It sets new benchmarks on HumanArt and COCO-OOD datasets while exhibiting superior zero-shot performance in pose annotation for tasks like image and video synthesis.

Conclusion: SDPose effectively adapts diffusion priors for human pose estimation, with robust performance across domains and applications, positioning it as a strong candidate for both academic and practical tasks.

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models provide rich multi-scale latent features and are
emerging as powerful vision backbones. While recent works such as
Marigold~\citep{ke2024repurposing} and Lotus~\citep{he2024lotus} adapt
diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization,
their potential for structured outputs (e.g., human pose estimation) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SDPose}, a fine-tuning
framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion
priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention
modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint
heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original
generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps
through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the
pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance
out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction
branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate
robustness under domain shift, we further construct \textbf{COCO-OOD}, a
style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just
one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains
parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new
state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD.
Furthermore, we showcase SDPose as a zero-shot pose annotator for downstream
controllable generation tasks, including ControlNet-based image synthesis and
video generation, where it delivers qualitatively superior pose guidance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PanoWorld-X, a framework for generating high-quality and controllable 360-degree panoramic videos, overcoming limitations of earlier works in camera control and scene continuity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for generating 360-degree visuals suffer from narrow field-of-view constraints or lack sufficient camera controllability, limiting exploration and usability.

Method: The authors developed PanoWorld-X by first creating a large-scale dataset of panoramic videos paired with exploration routes using Unreal Engine. They also designed the Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer to handle the spherical geometry of panoramic data.

Result: PanoWorld-X demonstrated superior performance across metrics such as motion range, control precision, and visual quality in experiments.

Conclusion: PanoWorld-X addresses key limitations of prior work and shows promise for real-world applications involving dynamic panoramic video generation.

Abstract: Generating a complete and explorable 360-degree visual world enables a wide
range of downstream applications. While prior works have advanced the field,
they remain constrained by either narrow field-of-view limitations, which
hinder the synthesis of continuous and holistic scenes, or insufficient camera
controllability that restricts free exploration by users or autonomous agents.
To address this, we propose PanoWorld-X, a novel framework for high-fidelity
and controllable panoramic video generation with diverse camera trajectories.
Specifically, we first construct a large-scale dataset of panoramic
video-exploration route pairs by simulating camera trajectories in virtual 3D
environments via Unreal Engine. As the spherical geometry of panoramic data
misaligns with the inductive priors from conventional video diffusion, we then
introduce a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer architecture that reprojects
equirectangular features onto the spherical surface to model geometric
adjacency in latent space, significantly enhancing visual fidelity and
spatiotemporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
PanoWorld-X achieves superior performance in various aspects, including motion
range, control precision, and visual quality, underscoring its potential for
real-world applications.

Motivation: Scaling large transformer models is challenging for substantial 3D scene reconstruction due to quadratic attention complexity.

Method: Introduced LVT which processes information locally around views and employs novel positional encoding based on relative geometric transformations.

Conclusion: LVT enables efficient and scalable 3D vision and novel view synthesis for large-scale scenes in a single forward pass.

Abstract: Large transformer models are proving to be a powerful tool for 3D vision and
novel view synthesis. However, the standard Transformer's well-known quadratic
complexity makes it difficult to scale these methods to large scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose the Local View Transformer (LVT), a
large-scale scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis architecture that
circumvents the need for the quadratic attention operation. Motivated by the
insight that spatially nearby views provide more useful signal about the local
scene composition than distant views, our model processes all information in a
local neighborhood around each view. To attend to tokens in nearby views, we
leverage a novel positional encoding that conditions on the relative geometric
transformation between the query and nearby views. We decode the output of our
model into a 3D Gaussian Splat scene representation that includes both color
and opacity view-dependence. Taken together, the Local View Transformer enables
reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward
pass. See our project page for results and interactive demos

### [669] [CLASP: Adaptive Spectral Clustering for Unsupervised Per-Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25016)
*Max Curie,Paulo da Costa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CLASP, a training-free framework for unsupervised image segmentation leveraging self-supervised ViT, spectral clustering, and DenseCRF for competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of unsupervised image segmentation on large unannotated datasets, relevant to fields like digital advertising and content moderation, without relying on labeled data or finetuning.

Method: CLASP uses a self-supervised ViT encoder for feature extraction, constructs an affinity matrix, performs spectral clustering, selects segment counts automatically using eigengap silhouette search, and sharpens boundaries with DenseCRF.

Result: CLASP achieves competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy for unsupervised segmentation on COCO Stuff and ADE20K datasets.

Conclusion: CLASP is a lightweight, reproducible, and training-free baseline for unsupervised segmentation tasks over large unannotated datasets.

Abstract: We introduce CLASP (Clustering via Adaptive Spectral Processing), a
lightweight framework for unsupervised image segmentation that operates without
any labeled data or finetuning. CLASP first extracts per patch features using a
self supervised ViT encoder (DINO); then, it builds an affinity matrix and
applies spectral clustering. To avoid manual tuning, we select the segment
count automatically with a eigengap silhouette search, and we sharpen the
boundaries with a fully connected DenseCRF. Despite its simplicity and training
free nature, CLASP attains competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff
and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines. The zero training design
makes CLASP a strong, easily reproducible baseline for large unannotated
corpora especially common in digital advertising and marketing workflows such
as brand safety screening, creative asset curation, and social media content
moderation

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a post-training framework for reinforcement learning (RL) models, enhancing their reasoning capabilities and adapting them for Earth Observation (EO) tasks, achieving superior performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth Observation tasks require unique task-aware reasoning capabilities that generic RL models are not optimized for, highlighting a need for specialized adaptation.

Method: The research introduces a novel post-training framework using task-aware rewards, enabling RL models to adapt effectively to EO tasks and improve reasoning on remote sensing images.

Result: Experiments conducted across various EO benchmarks consistently show performance improvements over existing generic and specialized vision-language models.

Conclusion: The approach successfully integrates task-aware reasoning within RL models for EO tasks, enhancing optimization stability, robustness, and overall performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have delivered strong
reasoning capabilities in natural image domains, yet their potential for Earth
Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. EO tasks introduce unique
challenges, spanning referred object detection, image or region captioning,
change detection, grounding, and temporal analysis, that demand task aware
reasoning. We propose a novel post training framework that incorporates task
aware rewards to enable effective adaptation of reasoning based RL models to
diverse EO tasks. This training strategy enhances reasoning capabilities for
remote sensing images, stabilizes optimization, and improves robustness.
Extensive experiments across multiple EO benchmarks show consistent performance
gains over state of the art generic and specialized vision language models.

### [671] [STAGE: Stable and Generalizable GRPO for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25027)
*Xiaoxiao Ma,Haibo Qiu,Guohui Zhang,Zhixiong Zeng,Siqi Yang,Lin Ma,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces STAGE, a framework addressing instability and poor generalization in applying GRPO for autoregressive text-to-image generation by tackling gradient conflicts and entropy dynamics issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GRPO applications on autoregressive image generation models are unstable, leading to disrupted pretrained model performance, marginal gains, and poor generalization during training.

Method: The proposed STAGE framework uses: (1) Advantage/KL reweighting to alleviate gradient conflicts from unnecessary tokens, and (2) an entropy-based reward mechanism to stabilize policy entropy dynamics during training.

Result: STAGE improves image quality, stability, and cross-task generalization over baseline GRPO across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: By addressing gradient conflicts and entropy instability, STAGE enhances autoregressive model training, achieving better visual quality and generalization while preserving pretrained capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently been explored to improve text-to-image
generation, yet applying existing GRPO algorithms to autoregressive (AR) image
models remains challenging. The instability of the training process easily
disrupts the pretrained model capability during long runs, resulting in
marginal gains, degraded image quality, and poor generalization. In this work,
we revisit GRPO for AR image generation and identify two key issues:
contradictory gradients from unnecessary tokens and unstable policy entropy
dynamics. To address these, we introduce STAGE, a stable and generalizable
framework that leverages two targeted solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting.
Similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting updates; and 2) Entropy
reward. An entropy-based reward corresponding to reference model to stabilize
learning. With the help of alleviating conflicts between tokens and an entropy
reward for stabilizing training, we reduce disruption of the pretrained
distribution and mitigate reward hacking, which in turn improves generalization
and transfer better to other benchmarks. Experiments across multiple benchmarks
show that STAGE consistently improves visual quality, stability, and cross-task
generalization compared to baseline GRPO.

### [672] [VT-FSL: Bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25033)
*Wenhao Li,Qiangchang Wang,Xianjing Meng,Zhibin Wu,Yilong Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VT-FSL, a few-shot learning framework that enhances semantic grounding using Large Language Models (LLMs) and geometric alignment for improved cross-modal integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot learning models struggle with noisy semantics due to a lack of grounding in visual evidence, leading to poor generalization from limited labeled data.

Method: The proposed VT-FSL framework incorporates Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) to condition LLMs on both class names and support images for generating detailed class descriptions. Additionally, Cross-modal Geometric Alignment (CGA) minimizes the kernelized parallelotope volume of textual and visual representations for consistent multimodal integration.

Result: VT-FSL achieves state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse few-shot learning benchmarks, including standard, cross-domain, and fine-grained datasets.

Conclusion: VT-FSL effectively addresses semantic noise and limited support data in few-shot learning by integrating precise LLM-based textual prompts and geometry-aware alignment of multimodal representations, demonstrating its effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few
labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by
incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic
fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that
contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual
instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these
issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for
Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts
conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly
integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of
Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment
(CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support
images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single
structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic
understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of
semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act
respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level
class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited
support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support,
and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the
3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear
relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent
multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new
state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard,
cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios. Code is available

In addition, an efficient method to improve robustness against camera angle
variations is also introduced by using artificially rotated training data.

*Huaizhi Qu,Xiao Wang,Gengwei Zhang,Jie Peng,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEM, a cryo-EM framework utilizing 3D Gaussian Splatting for efficient, accurate reconstruction, achieving faster training and lower memory usage than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryo-EM datasets are massive, making existing reconstruction methods computationally expensive and memory intensive. There is a need for a scalable approach that balances efficiency and resolution.

Method: GEM uses 3D Gaussian Splatting to represent proteins with compact Gaussian models parameterized by 11 values, plus a novel gradient computation technique to improve training efficiency.

Result: GEM achieves up to 48% faster training, 12% lower memory usage, and improves local resolution by up to 38.8% compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Conclusion: GEM offers a scalable cryo-EM reconstruction paradigm that unifies speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a central tool for
high-resolution structural biology, yet the massive scale of datasets (often
exceeding 100k particle images) renders 3D reconstruction both computationally
expensive and memory intensive. Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient
but lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space
approaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur
cubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel
cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that
operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of
modeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D
Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the
training efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians
that contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory
footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to
48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These results
establish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction,
unifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy. Our code is available

TL;DR: BRIDGE is a new framework for monocular depth estimation using RL for synthetic data generation and hybrid training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations in traditional monocular depth estimation methods due to data scarcity and quality.

Method: Developed an RL-optimized depth-to-image generation framework and hybrid supervision strategy for training.

Result: BRIDGE generates 20M realistic RGB-depth pairs, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and scene detail.

Conclusion: BRIDGE improves scalability, domain diversity, and robustness in monocular depth estimation models.

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a foundational task for computer vision.
Traditional methods are limited by data scarcity and quality, hindering their
robustness. To overcome this, we propose BRIDGE, an RL-optimized depth-to-image
(D2I) generation framework that synthesizes over 20M realistic and
geometrically accurate RGB images, each intrinsically paired with its ground
truth depth, from diverse source depth maps. Then we train our depth estimation
model on this dataset, employing a hybrid supervision strategy that integrates
teacher pseudo-labels with ground truth depth for comprehensive and robust
training. This innovative data generation and training paradigm enables BRIDGE
to achieve breakthroughs in scale and domain diversity, consistently
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and in
complex scene detail capture, thereby fostering general and robust depth

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniLat3D, a unified framework for generating high-quality 3D assets directly in one stage, addressing issues like geometry-texture misalignment in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D generation models rely on two-stage pipelines which often result in geometry and texture misalignment and high computational costs.

Method: UniLat3D employs a Unified VAE to encode geometry and appearance into a single latent space, using flow-matching for direct generation of 3D assets.

Result: UniLat3D can produce high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image, achieving superior geometric and appearance fidelity using only public datasets.

Conclusion: A unified single-stage generation strategy proves effective for creating high-fidelity 3D assets, setting a new benchmark in efficiency and quality.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D asset generation is crucial for various industries. While
recent 3D pretrained models show strong capability in producing realistic
content, most are built upon diffusion models and follow a two-stage pipeline
that first generates geometry and then synthesizes appearance. Such a decoupled
design tends to produce geometry-texture misalignment and non-negligible cost.
In this paper, we propose UniLat3D, a unified framework that encodes geometry
and appearance in a single latent space, enabling direct single-stage
generation. Our key contribution is a geometry-appearance Unified VAE, which
compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation
-- UniLat. UniLat integrates structural and visual information into a dense
low-resolution latent, which can be efficiently decoded into diverse 3D
formats, e.g., 3D Gaussians and meshes. Based on this unified representation,
we train a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into
UniLat, eliminating redundant stages. Trained solely on public datasets,
UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image,
achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality. More demos \&

### [677] [MANI-Pure: Magnitude-Adaptive Noise Injection for Adversarial Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25082)
*Xiaoyi Huang,Junwei Wu,Kejia Zhang,Carl Yang,Zhiming Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MANI-Pure, a defense mechanism against adversarial attacks, using adaptive frequency-targeted noise rather than uniform noise injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial purification methods using diffusion models add uniform noise that disrupts semantic structures and weakens robustness, despite adversarial perturbations not being uniformly distributed.

Method: The proposed MANI-Pure framework leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to apply heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise that suppresses high-frequency perturbations while preserving low-frequency semantic content.

Result: MANI-Pure achieves a minimal gap of 0.59 in clean accuracy compared to the original classifier, improves robust accuracy by 2.15, and sets a new top-1 robust accuracy record on RobustBench.

Conclusion: MANI-Pure effectively enhances adversarial robustness by using adaptive noise injection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both clean and robust accuracy metrics.

Abstract: Adversarial purification with diffusion models has emerged as a promising
defense strategy, but existing methods typically rely on uniform noise
injection, which indiscriminately perturbs all frequencies, corrupting semantic
structures and undermining robustness. Our empirical study reveals that
adversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed: they are predominantly
concentrated in high-frequency regions, with heterogeneous magnitude intensity
patterns that vary across frequencies and attack types. Motivated by this
observation, we introduce MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification
framework that leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide the
purification process. Instead of injecting homogeneous noise, MANI-Pure
adaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise, effectively
suppressing adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude
bands while preserving semantically critical low-frequency content. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K validate the effectiveness of
MANI-Pure. It narrows the clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original
classifier, while boosting robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves the top-1
robust accuracy on the RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Triangle Splatting+', a method to simplify and optimize 3D scene rendering by directly using mesh-based triangle primitives, instead of Gaussian splatting, for compatibility with standard graphics pipelines and enhanced visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting produce high-quality 3D reconstruction and rendering but face usability challenges in VR and real-time applications due to inefficiencies and incompatibility with mesh-based pipelines.

Method: Triangle Splatting+ directly optimizes triangle primitives within a differentiable splatting framework. The approach parameterizes triangles to maintain connectivity through shared vertices and trains the model to prioritize opaque triangles, making the output compatible with standard graphics engines without requiring post-processing.

Result: Triangle Splatting+ achieves state-of-the-art results in mesh-based novel view synthesis. Experiments on datasets like Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples show improved visual fidelity and efficiency compared to prior splatting methods.

Conclusion: This approach advances 3D graphics by bridging high-quality reconstruction with practical applications in real-time rendering on standard graphics engines, supporting tasks such as physics simulations and interactive walkthroughs.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views has seen rapid progress
in recent years. Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that continuous volumetric
radiance fields can achieve high-quality image synthesis, but their long
training and rendering times limit practicality. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
addressed these issues by representing scenes with millions of Gaussians,
enabling real-time rendering and fast optimization. However, Gaussian
primitives are not natively compatible with the mesh-based pipelines used in VR
headsets, and real-time graphics applications. Existing solutions attempt to
convert Gaussians into meshes through post-processing or two-stage pipelines,
which increases complexity and degrades visual quality. In this work, we
introduce Triangle Splatting+, which directly optimizes triangles, the
fundamental primitive of computer graphics, within a differentiable splatting
framework. We formulate triangle parametrization to enable connectivity through
shared vertices, and we design a training strategy that enforces opaque
triangles. The final output is immediately usable in standard graphics engines
without post-processing. Experiments on the Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples
datasets show that Triangle Splatting+achieves state-of-the-art performance in
mesh-based novel view synthesis. Our method surpasses prior splatting
approaches in visual fidelity while remaining efficient and fast to training.
Moreover, the resulting semi-connected meshes support downstream applications
such as physics-based simulation or interactive walkthroughs. The project page

*Mingyuan Zhou,Yi Gu,Huangjie Zheng,Liangchen Song,Guande He,Yizhe Zhang,Wenze Hu,Yinfei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified perspective on Gaussian diffusion and flow matching and demonstrates the compatibility of Score identity Distillation (SiD) with text-to-image flow-matching models, enabling faster image generation without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models excel in image generation quality but are computationally expensive due to slow iterative sampling, and there is a need for faster, unified techniques compatible with various models.

Method: The authors derive a unification of Gaussian diffusion and flow matching using Bayes' rule and conditional expectations, and extend SiD to pretrained flow-matching models with minor adjustments, requiring no significant finetuning or architectural changes.

Result: Experiments show SiD is effective across diverse text-to-image flow-matching models, both in data-free and data-aided setups, without stability or soundness issues.

Conclusion: This work validates the broad applicability of score distillation to text-to-image flow-matching models, bridging diffusion and flow-based generators, and advancing efficient image generation methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but are limited by
slow iterative sampling. Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one-
or few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct
framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion
under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation
techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple
derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies
Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations.
Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to
pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium,
SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show
that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works
out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings,
without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides
the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to
text-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability
and soundness and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and
flow-based generators. We will make the PyTorch implementation publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs face challenges in visual-spatial reasoning. The proposed VideoAnchor module addresses these issues by strengthening visual token alignment using subspace affinities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs show limitations in consistently identifying visual cues across video frames due to language token dominance in attention mechanisms.

Method: A novel connection between sparse subspace clustering principles and transformer attention mechanisms is proposed to anchor shared visual features across frames using the VideoAnchor module.

Result: VideoAnchor demonstrates substantial performance improvements on benchmarks, such as 3.2% on VSI-Bench and 4.6% on Video-MME tasks, alongside improved visual grounding.

Conclusion: The VideoAnchor module enhances MLLM capabilities in visual-spatial reasoning without retraining, providing a significant step forward in multimodal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in
vision-language alignment, yet they remain limited in visual-spatial reasoning.
We first identify that this limitation arises from the attention mechanism:
visual tokens are overshadowed by language tokens, preventing the model from
consistently recognizing the same visual cues across frames. To address this
challenge, we draw a novel connection between the self-expressiveness property
in sparse subspace clustering and the attention mechanism in Transformers.
Building on this insight, we propose VideoAnchor, a plug-and-play module that
leverages subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames without
retraining, effectively anchoring attention to shared visual structures.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and backbone models show consistent
performance gains -- $e.g.$, 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and
Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B -- while
qualitative analyses demonstrate more coherent subspace partitions and stronger
visual grounding. Our codes will be made public available at

*Kunhao Liu,Wenbo Hu,Jiale Xu,Ying Shan,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Rolling Forcing, a video generation technique that minimizes error accumulation in streaming long videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing streaming video generation methods suffer from error accumulation, degrading video quality over long durations.

Method: The technique includes a joint denoising scheme, an attention sink mechanism, and an efficient training algorithm to suppress error propagation and enhance consistency.

Result: Experiments demonstrate real-time generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU, with improved video quality and reduced error bias.

Conclusion: Rolling Forcing achieves high-quality, temporally coherent video streaming over extended durations, addressing key challenges in this domain.

Abstract: Streaming video generation, as one fundamental component in interactive world
models and neural game engines, aims to generate high-quality, low-latency, and
temporally coherent long video streams. However, most existing work suffers
from severe error accumulation that often significantly degrades the generated
stream videos over long horizons. We design Rolling Forcing, a novel video
generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error
accumulation. Rolling Forcing comes with three novel designs. First, instead of
iteratively sampling individual frames, which accelerates error propagation, we
design a joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames
with progressively increasing noise levels. This design relaxes the strict
causality across adjacent frames, effectively suppressing error growth. Second,
we introduce the attention sink mechanism into the long-horizon stream video
generation task, which allows the model to keep key value states of initial
frames as a global context anchor and thereby enhances long-term global
consistency. Third, we design an efficient training algorithm that enables
few-step distillation over largely extended denoising windows. This algorithm
operates on non-overlapping windows and mitigates exposure bias conditioned on
self-generated histories. Extensive experiments show that Rolling Forcing
enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU,
with substantially reduced error accumulation.

*Bowei Chen,Sai Bi,Hao Tan,He Zhang,Tianyuan Zhang,Zhengqi Li,Yuanjun Xiong,Jianming Zhang,Kai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to use pretrained visual encoders as semantically rich tokenizers for diffusion models in image generation, improving generation quality and accelerating training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of training variational autoencoders from scratch, which focus on low-level details but overlook semantic richness. By leveraging pretrained visual encoders, the method aims to integrate detailed semantics into latent diffusion models.

Method: The proposed method involves a three-stage alignment strategy: (1) Freeze the encoder and train an adapter and decoder to establish a semantic latent space; (2) Jointly optimize all components with a semantic preservation loss to capture perceptual details while retaining high-level semantics; (3) Refine the decoder to enhance reconstruction quality.

Result: The proposed tokenizer demonstrated significant advantages: on ImageNet 256x256, diffusion models achieved a gFID of 1.90 in just 64 epochs, and the method outperformed FLUX VAE when scaled to larger datasets. It improved generation quality with or without classifier-free guidance.

Conclusion: This method provides a simple, scalable, and semantically rich paradigm for tokenizer design in diffusion models, enhancing efficiency and semantic quality in image generation tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we propose aligning pretrained visual encoders to serve as
tokenizers for latent diffusion models in image generation. Unlike training a
variational autoencoder (VAE) from scratch, which primarily emphasizes
low-level details, our approach leverages the rich semantic structure of
foundation encoders. We introduce a three-stage alignment strategy: (1) freeze
the encoder and train an adapter and a decoder to establish a semantic latent
space; (2) jointly optimize all components with an additional semantic
preservation loss, enabling the encoder to capture perceptual details while
retaining high-level semantics; and (3) refine the decoder for improved
reconstruction quality. This alignment yields semantically rich image
tokenizers that benefit diffusion models. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, our
tokenizer accelerates the convergence of diffusion models, reaching a gFID of
1.90 within just 64 epochs, and improves generation both with and without
classifier-free guidance. Scaling to LAION, a 2B-parameter text-to-image model
trained with our tokenizer consistently outperforms FLUX VAE under the same
training steps. Overall, our method is simple, scalable, and establishes a
semantically grounded paradigm for continuous tokenizer design.

*Yuxin Jiang,Yuchao Gu,Yiren Song,Ivor Tsang,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PICO, a framework repurposing diffusion transformers for flexible and efficient visual personalization without retraining, surpassing existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision models excel at predefined tasks but face challenges with personalized, user-defined objectives at test time, requiring more flexible and efficient solutions.

Method: The authors developed PICO, a four-panel framework using diffusion transformers for visual in-context learning. PICO leverages a single annotated example to infer transformations, combined with the diverse VisRel dataset and an attention-guided seed scorer for robust generalization.

Result: PICO demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional fine-tuning and synthetic-data-based methods, effectively adapting to novel user-defined tasks and generalizing across recognition and generation tasks.

Conclusion: PICO represents a scalable, flexible approach to visual personalization, enabling efficient adaptation to diverse tasks using in-context learning techniques.

Abstract: Modern vision models, trained on large-scale annotated datasets, excel at
predefined tasks but struggle with personalized vision -- tasks defined at test
time by users with customized objects or novel objectives. Existing
personalization approaches rely on costly fine-tuning or synthetic data
pipelines, which are inflexible and restricted to fixed task formats. Visual
in-context learning (ICL) offers a promising alternative, yet prior methods
confine to narrow, in-domain tasks and fail to generalize to open-ended
personalization. We introduce Personalized In-Context Operator (PICO), a simple
four-panel framework that repurposes diffusion transformers as visual
in-context learners. Given a single annotated exemplar, PICO infers the
underlying transformation and applies it to new inputs without retraining. To
enable this, we construct VisRel, a compact yet diverse tuning dataset, showing
that task diversity, rather than scale, drives robust generalization. We
further propose an attention-guided seed scorer that improves reliability via
efficient inference scaling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PICO (i)
surpasses fine-tuning and synthetic-data baselines, (ii) flexibly adapts to
novel user-defined tasks, and (iii) generalizes across both recognition and
generation.

### [685] [Mitigating Hallucination in Multimodal LLMs with Layer Contrastive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25177)
*Bingkui Tong,Jiaer Xia,Kaiyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Layer Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD), a method to reduce hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by leveraging contrast between shallow and deep visual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often produce hallucinated outputs, creating challenges in maintaining accuracy and consistency when reasoning based on visual input.

Method: Layer Contrastive Decoding contrasts outputs derived from shallow and deep layers of a vision encoder to filter out hallucinations from MLLMs.

Result: LayerCD demonstrated significant improvements in performance over current state-of-the-art methods across two hallucination benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed LayerCD method effectively mitigates hallucination issues in MLLMs, enabling better reasoning and perception capabilities. The implementation code is publicly available.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive perception and
reasoning capabilities, yet they often suffer from hallucinations -- generating
outputs that are linguistically coherent but inconsistent with the context of
the input image, including inaccuracies in objects, attributes, and relations.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple approach called Layer
Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD). Our design is motivated by the observation that
shallow visual features are much more likely than deep visual features to cause
an MLLM to hallucinate as they only capture biased, low-level information that
is insufficient for high-level reasoning. Therefore, LayerCD aims to filter out
hallucinations by contrasting the output distributions generated from visual
features of different levels, specifically those from the shallow and deep
layers of the vision encoder, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on
two hallucination benchmarks and show that LayerCD significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art. The code for LayerCD is available at
https://github.com/maifoundations/LayerCD .

### [686] [GHOST: Hallucination-Inducing Image Generation for Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25178)
*Aryan Yazdan Parast,Parsa Hosseini,Hesam Asadollahzadeh,Arshia Soltani Moakhar,Basim Azam,Soheil Feizi,Naveed Akhtar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents GHOST, a method to stress-test and analyze hallucination vulnerabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by generating images that intentionally cause object hallucination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models are vulnerable to object hallucination, where models perceive objects not present in an image. Current benchmarks, relying on static datasets, fail to reveal model-specific or unforeseen hallucination issues. There's a need for a more dynamic diagnostic tool.

Method: The authors developed GHOST, an automatic method that optimizes image embeddings to generate natural yet subtly misleading images via a diffusion model. These images are designed to trick MLLMs into hallucinating while ensuring the images remain visually realistic and object-free.

Result: GHOST achieved a hallucination success rate of over 28%, significantly outperforming prior methods (∼1%). It uncovered transferable vulnerabilities, such as images optimized for one model inducing hallucinations in another (e.g., 66.5% success rate for Qwen2.5-VL to GPT-4o). Human and quantitative evaluations confirmed image quality and object absence.

Conclusion: GHOST effectively diagnoses hallucination vulnerabilities in MLLMs and offers a corrective avenue by fine-tuning models on the generated deceptive images, making it a promising tool for advancing reliable multimodal systems.

Abstract: Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a
persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the
image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with
fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering
model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce
GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method
designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce
hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or
prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to
mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a
diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking
images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original
input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to
hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including
reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success
rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery
methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and
object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST
uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce
hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on
our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and
corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.

### [687] [DC-Gen: Post-Training Diffusion Acceleration with Deeply Compressed Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25180)
*Wenkun He,Yuchao Gu,Junyu Chen,Dongyun Zou,Yujun Lin,Zhekai Zhang,Haocheng Xi,Muyang Li,Ligeng Zhu,Jincheng Yu,Junsong Chen,Enze Xie,Song Han,Han Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents DC-Gen, a method to accelerate text-to-image diffusion models using compressed latent spaces with minimal fine-tuning, achieving major speedups in generating 4K images without loss of quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image diffusion models are efficient at generating high-quality images but are computationally expensive when scaled to high resolutions like 4K. Current acceleration methods do not address redundancy in latent spaces, creating inefficiencies.

Method: DC-Gen employs a deeply compressed latent space with a post-training pipeline to optimize existing diffusion models. It tackles latent space redundancy using lightweight embedding alignment training and minimal LoRA fine-tuning to maintain generation quality.

Result: DC-Gen achieves significant performance improvements, including a 53x speedup on generating 4K images using an NVIDIA H100 GPU and a 138x latency reduction with NVFP4 SVDQuant. It preserves the image quality of the base models while drastically improving efficiency.

Conclusion: DC-Gen provides a practical and efficient solution to the computational challenges of high-resolution image generation in diffusion models, showcasing significant speedups and maintained quality without requiring extensive retraining.

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality
images, but face significant efficiency challenges when scaled to high
resolutions, like 4K image generation. While previous research accelerates
diffusion models in various aspects, it seldom handles the inherent redundancy
within the latent space. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a
general framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging
a deeply compressed latent space. Rather than a costly training-from-scratch
approach, DC-Gen uses an efficient post-training pipeline to preserve the
quality of the base model. A key challenge in this paradigm is the
representation gap between the base model's latent space and a deeply
compressed latent space, which can lead to instability during direct
fine-tuning. To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with
a lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are
aligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base
model's inherent generation quality. We verify DC-Gen's effectiveness on SANA
and FLUX.1-Krea. The resulting DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX models achieve
quality comparable to their base models but with a significant speedup.
Specifically, DC-Gen-FLUX reduces the latency of 4K image generation by 53x on
the NVIDIA H100 GPU. When combined with NVFP4 SVDQuant, DC-Gen-FLUX generates a
4K image in just 3.5 seconds on a single NVIDIA 5090 GPU, achieving a total
latency reduction of 138x compared to the base FLUX.1-Krea model. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC-VideoGen offers a framework for post-training acceleration of video diffusion models, achieving significant latency reduction without sacrificing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in video generation using pre-trained video diffusion models, aiming for faster inference while maintaining high-quality reconstruction.

Method: DC-VideoGen utilizes a Deep Compression Video Autoencoder and an adaptation strategy called AE-Adapt-V to transfer pre-trained models into highly compressed latent spaces.

Result: DC-VideoGen allows up to 14.8x faster inference latency and supports high-resolution 2160x3840 video generation on a single GPU.

Conclusion: DC-VideoGen is a practical and efficient tool for enhancing video generation workflows, making faster, high-quality video generation accessible with less computational demand.

Abstract: We introduce DC-VideoGen, a post-training acceleration framework for
efficient video generation. DC-VideoGen can be applied to any pre-trained video
diffusion model, improving efficiency by adapting it to a deep compression
latent space with lightweight fine-tuning. The framework builds on two key
innovations: (i) a Deep Compression Video Autoencoder with a novel chunk-causal
temporal design that achieves 32x/64x spatial and 4x temporal compression while
preserving reconstruction quality and generalization to longer videos; and (ii)
AE-Adapt-V, a robust adaptation strategy that enables rapid and stable transfer
of pre-trained models into the new latent space. Adapting the pre-trained
Wan-2.1-14B model with DC-VideoGen requires only 10 GPU days on the NVIDIA H100
GPU. The accelerated models achieve up to 14.8x lower inference latency than
their base counterparts without compromising quality, and further enable
2160x3840 video generation on a single GPU. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAD3R provides a method to reconstruct deformable 3D objects from unposed monocular videos through personalized pose estimation and 3D Gaussian representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address challenges in reconstructing 3D objects under conditions such as significant deformation, extensive camera movements, and limited viewing coverage in monocular video sequences.

Method: PAD3R utilizes a personalized pose estimator supervised by pre-trained image-to-3D models, combined with deformable 3D Gaussian representation and long-term 2D point tracking, aided by generative priors and differentiable rendering.

Result: PAD3R demonstrates robust capabilities in reconstructing articulated and high-fidelity 3D representations in complex scenarios, generalizing well across challenging use cases.

Conclusion: PAD3R advances dynamic scene understanding and 3D content creation by enabling effective modeling of deformable objects under monocular video constraints.

Abstract: We present PAD3R, a method for reconstructing deformable 3D objects from
casually captured, unposed monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches, PAD3R
handles long video sequences featuring substantial object deformation,
large-scale camera movement, and limited view coverage that typically challenge
conventional systems. At its core, our approach trains a personalized,
object-centric pose estimator, supervised by a pre-trained image-to-3D model.
This guides the optimization of deformable 3D Gaussian representation. The
optimization is further regularized by long-term 2D point tracking over the
entire input video. By combining generative priors and differentiable
rendering, PAD3R reconstructs high-fidelity, articulated 3D representations of
objects in a category-agnostic way. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
results show that PAD3R is robust and generalizes well across challenging
scenarios, highlighting its potential for dynamic scene understanding and 3D
content creation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelCraft introduces a multi-agent system to improve multimodal large language models’ performance on structured images using high-fidelity image processing and dynamic visual reasoning workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of perceptual errors in multimodal large language models processing structured images, and enable flexible visual reasoning beyond linear, rigid patterns.

Method: PixelCraft employs a multi-agent system including visual tools, a high-quality corpus for fine-tuning, pixel-level localizations, traditional CV algorithms, and a dynamic reasoning workflow involving tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism.

Result: Experiments show PixelCraft significantly enhances visual reasoning performance on complex structured-image tasks such as charts and geometry benchmarks, setting a new standard.

Conclusion: PixelCraft’s approach enables advanced multimodal models to better handle structured images through adaptive and high-fidelity reasoning processes, offering improved accuracy and flexibility.

Abstract: Structured images (e.g., charts and geometric diagrams) remain challenging
for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as perceptual slips can cascade
into erroneous conclusions. Intermediate visual cues can steer reasoning;
however, existing cue-based methods are constrained with low-fidelity image
processing and linear, rigid reasoning patterns, limiting their effectiveness
on complex structured-image tasks. In this paper, we propose PixelCraft, a
novel multi-agent system for high-fidelity image processing and flexible visual
reasoning on structured images. The system comprises a dispatcher, a planner, a
reasoner, critics, and a set of visual tool agents. To achieve high-fidelity
processing, we construct a high-quality corpus and fine-tune an MLLM into a
grounding model, whose pixel-level localizations are integrated with
traditional computer vision (CV) algorithms in tool agents. Building on this
foundation, PixelCraft facilitates flexible visual reasoning through a dynamic
three-stage workflow of tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism.
Moreover, unlike prior linear reasoning patterns that simply append historical
images, PixelCraft maintains an image memory to allow the planner to adaptively
revisit earlier visual steps, explore alternative reasoning branches, and
dynamically adjust the reasoning trajectory during discussion. Extensive
experiments on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks demonstrate that
PixelCraft significantly improves visual reasoning performance for advanced
MLLMs, setting a new standard for structured image reasoning. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/microsoft/PixelCraft.

*Yunyang Ge,Xinhua Cheng,Chengshu Zhao,Xianyi He,Shenghai Yuan,Bin Lin,Bin Zhu,Li Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FlashI2V, a novel Image-to-Video generation method that prevents conditional image leakage and achieves superior performance and generalization for out-of-domain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues like conditional image leakage in existing Image-to-Video methods, which lead to performance degradation, slow motion, and color inconsistencies.

Method: The proposed FlashI2V method combines two strategies: Latent Shifting to subtract conditional image information from noisy latents, and Fourier Guidance to accelerate convergence using high-frequency features.

Result: FlashI2V achieves state-of-the-art performance in out-of-domain scenarios with a dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V, outperforming larger models using only 1.3B parameters.

Conclusion: FlashI2V resolves conditional image leakage and establishes itself as a leading I2V paradigm for both fidelity and generalization by generating high-quality videos efficiently.

Abstract: In Image-to-Video (I2V) generation, a video is created using an input image
as the first-frame condition. Existing I2V methods concatenate the full
information of the conditional image with noisy latents to achieve high
fidelity. However, the denoisers in these methods tend to shortcut the
conditional image, which is known as conditional image leakage, leading to
performance degradation issues such as slow motion and color inconsistency. In
this work, we further clarify that conditional image leakage leads to
overfitting to in-domain data and decreases the performance in out-of-domain
scenarios. Moreover, we introduce Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting I2V, named
FlashI2V, to prevent conditional image leakage. Concretely, FlashI2V consists
of: (1) Latent Shifting. We modify the source and target distributions of flow
matching by subtracting the conditional image information from the noisy
latents, thereby incorporating the condition implicitly. (2) Fourier Guidance.
We use high-frequency magnitude features obtained by the Fourier Transform to
accelerate convergence and enable the adjustment of detail levels in the
generated video. Experimental results show that our method effectively
overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves the best generalization and
performance on out-of-domain data among various I2V paradigms. With only 1.3B
parameters, FlashI2V achieves a dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V,
surpassing CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P. Github page:

### [692] [Visual Jigsaw Post-Training Improves MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25190)
*Penghao Wu,Yushan Zhang,Haiwen Diao,Bo Li,Lewei Lu,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes "Visual Jigsaw," a self-supervised, vision-centric post-training framework for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), enhancing visual understanding by solving partitioned, shuffled visual inputs without requiring additional generative components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although reinforcement learning-based post-training has improved reasoning and alignment in MLLMs, current methods focus heavily on text-centric paradigms while underutilizing dense visual cues. There is a need for vision-centric post-training methods that do not rely on text as an intermediate step.

Method: The authors introduced a self-supervised task called "Visual Jigsaw," where visual inputs (images, videos, or 3D data) are partitioned and shuffled, requiring the MLLM to reconstruct the correct order of these inputs in natural language. This task is aligned with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) and does not require annotations or additional visual generative designs.

Result: Through extensive experiments, "Visual Jigsaw" demonstrated considerable improvement in the MLLMs' ability to handle fine-grained perception, temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding across images, videos, and 3D data.

Conclusion: The study reveals that vision-centric self-supervised tasks, such as "Visual Jigsaw," can significantly enhance visual reasoning in MLLMs. It advocates for more research into vision-centric pretext designs for improved performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training has recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing the alignment and reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). While vision-centric post-training is crucial
for enhancing MLLMs' intrinsic understanding of visual signals, current
post-training paradigms are predominantly text-centric, where dense visual
inputs are only leveraged to extract sparse cues for text-based reasoning.
There exist a few approaches in this direction, however, they often still rely
on text as an intermediate mediator or introduce additional visual generative
designs. In this work, we introduce Visual Jigsaw, a generic self-supervised
post-training framework designed to strengthen visual understanding in MLLMs.
Visual Jigsaw is formulated as a general ordering task: visual inputs are
partitioned, shuffled, and the model must reconstruct the visual information by
producing the correct permutation in natural language. This naturally aligns
with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), requires no
additional visual generative components, and derives its supervisory signal
automatically without any annotations. We instantiate Visual Jigsaw across
three visual modalities, including images, videos, and 3D data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in fine-grained perception,
temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding. Our findings highlight the
potential of self-supervised vision-centric tasks in post-training MLLMs and
aim to inspire further research on vision-centric pretext designs. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VGGT-X to address scalability and data fidelity challenges in dense Novel View Synthesis using 3D Foundation Models (3DFMs), significantly improving performance without relying on traditional COLMAP initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of current Novel View Synthesis approaches that depend on slow and fragile methods like Structure-from-Motion (SfM), particularly under low-texture environments. The authors aim to overcome scalability and fidelity issues in dense NVS applications of 3DFMs.

Method: The approach combines a memory-efficient VGGT implementation capable of handling over 1,000 images, adaptive global alignment for enhancing VGGT outputs, and robust training practices for 3D graphics synthesis. These measures optimize the use of 3DFMs for dense view synthesis.

Result: The proposed VGGT-X significantly closes the fidelity gap with COLMAP-initialized pipelines and achieves state-of-the-art results in dense Novel View Synthesis and pose estimation without conventional SfM dependencies.

Conclusion: VGGT-X demonstrates the feasibility of scaling 3DFMs for dense NVS applications. While closing significant performance gaps, it provides insights for further improvements in 3DFM-based techniques and alternatives to COLMAP-based pipelines.

Abstract: We study the problem of applying 3D Foundation Models (3DFMs) to dense Novel
View Synthesis (NVS). Despite significant progress in Novel View Synthesis
powered by NeRF and 3DGS, current approaches remain reliant on accurate 3D
attributes (e.g., camera poses and point clouds) acquired from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), which is often slow and fragile in low-texture or
low-overlap captures. Recent 3DFMs showcase orders of magnitude speedup over
the traditional pipeline and great potential for online NVS. But most of the
validation and conclusions are confined to sparse-view settings. Our study
reveals that naively scaling 3DFMs to dense views encounters two fundamental
barriers: dramatically increasing VRAM burden and imperfect outputs that
degrade initialization-sensitive 3D training. To address these barriers, we
introduce VGGT-X, incorporating a memory-efficient VGGT implementation that
scales to 1,000+ images, an adaptive global alignment for VGGT output
enhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices. Extensive experiments show
that these measures substantially close the fidelity gap with
COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art results in dense
COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation. Additionally, we analyze the causes of
remaining gaps with COLMAP-initialized rendering, providing insights for the
future development of 3D foundation models and dense NVS. Our project page is

TL;DR: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are critical for privacy-focused computations; this paper explores their bottlenecks and scalability on GPUs, especially focusing on underutilized components like Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic performance analysis for Zero-Knowledge Proofs on GPUs and identify bottlenecks impeding efficient GPU utilization.

Method: Conduct a comprehensive performance study of ZKP computational kernels like Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT) and Multi-Scalar Multiplication (MSM) on GPUs, utilizing runtime tuning and architectural optimizations.

Result: It reveals that under-optimized NTT implementations account for up to 90% of ZKP latency on GPUs, and GPU integer pipelines remain a key limiting factor due to limited instruction-level parallelism.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights and optimization strategies to improve ZKP performance on GPUs, including runtime parameter tuning and better compute resource utilization.

Abstract: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) are protocols which construct cryptographic
proofs to demonstrate knowledge of a secret input in a computation without
revealing any information about the secret. ZKPs enable novel applications in
private and verifiable computing such as anonymized cryptocurrencies and
blockchain scaling and have seen adoption in several real-world systems. Prior
work has accelerated ZKPs on GPUs by leveraging the inherent parallelism in
core computation kernels like Multi-Scalar Multiplication (MSM). However, we
find that a systematic characterization of execution bottlenecks in ZKPs, as
well as their scalability on modern GPU architectures, is missing in the
literature. This paper presents ZKProphet, a comprehensive performance study of
Zero-Knowledge Proofs on GPUs. Following massive speedups of MSM, we find that
ZKPs are bottlenecked by kernels like Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT), as they
account for up to 90% of the proof generation latency on GPUs when paired with
optimized MSM implementations. Available NTT implementations under-utilize GPU
compute resources and often do not employ architectural features like
asynchronous compute and memory operations. We observe that the arithmetic
operations underlying ZKPs execute exclusively on the GPU's 32-bit integer
pipeline and exhibit limited instruction-level parallelism due to data
dependencies. Their performance is thus limited by the available integer
compute units. While one way to scale the performance of ZKPs is adding more
compute units, we discuss how runtime parameter tuning for optimizations like
precomputed inputs and alternative data representations can extract additional
speedup. With this work, we provide the ZKP community a roadmap to scale
performance on GPUs and construct definitive GPU-accelerated ZKPs for their
application requirements and available hardware resources.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the growing energy costs and carbon footprint associated with the increasing demand for high-performance computing.

Method: The authors analyze the full lifecycle of large-scale systems, introducing the energy mix and employing a predictive model to estimate HPC's impact over the next five years.

Result: A predictive model was developed for estimating the carbon footprint and energy trends of high-performance systems over a five-year trajectory.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the environmental impact of HPC systems, helping to understand their future trends and trajectory toward 2030.

Abstract: The demand in computing power has never stopped growing over the years.
Today, the performance of the most powerful systems exceeds the exascale.
Unfortunately, this growth also comes with ever-increasing energy costs,
leading to a high carbon footprint. This paper investigates the evolution of
high performance systems in terms of carbon emissions. A lot of studies focus
on Top500 (and Green500) as the tip of an iceberg to identify trends in the
domain in terms of computing performance. We propose here to go further in
considering the whole span life of several large scale systems and to link the
evolution with trajectory toward 2030. More precisely, we introduce the energy
mix in the analysis of Top500 systems and we derive a predictive model for

### [696] [FLAME: A Serving System Optimized for Large-Scale Generative Recommendation with Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22681)
*Xianwen Guo,Bin Huang,Xiaomeng Wu,Guanlin Wu,Fangjian Li,Shijia Wang,Qiang Xiao,Chuanjiang Luo,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces FLAME, an efficient system for large-scale deployment of Generative Recommendation (GR) models using CPU-GPU optimization and memory management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GR models provide better scaling than traditional recommendation models but are hindered by their computational demands, making online deployment at scale challenging for practical use.

Method: The authors propose FLAME, which uses CPU-GPU hardware for feature pre-processing and model computation, a Proximal Data Accelerator (PDA) for memory optimization, a Fused Kernel Engine (FKE) for computation efficiency, and a Dynamic Stream Orchestrator (DSO) to handle concurrent requests.

Result: FLAME achieved up to 6.1x speedup in model computation, a 6.3x throughput gain, 1.7x latency reduction, and improvements in handling non-uniform workloads across various scenarios.

Conclusion: FLAME effectively addresses the computational challenges of deploying GR models at scale, demonstrating substantial performance gains in throughput, speed, and efficiency.

Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) models possess greater scaling power compared
to traditional deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs), yet they also
impose a tremendous increase in computational burden. Measured in FLOPs, a
typical GR model's workload sits in $10^9 \sim 10^{11}$ range, roughly four
orders of magnitude higher than traditional DLRMs. Delivering accurate results
in a few tens of milliseconds while processing billions of such requests per
day puts extreme demands on the performance of the online serving system.
Therefore, for industry practitioners, the alluring gains of GR models are
tempered by the formidable challenge of online deployment at scale in
production services. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive solution of
online serving system tailored For Large-scale GenerAtive RecoMmendation with
Efficiency (FLAME). Specifically, we leveraging CPU-GPU heterogeneous hardware
to decouple feature pre-processing and model computation. We encapsulated
several memory optimization features as the Proximal Data Accelerator (PDA)
module to make full use of limited bandwidth and storage resources, which
achieves a 1.9x throughput gain and a 1.7x latency reduction. We implement the
Fused Kernel Engine (FKE) module based on the functionality and interface of
NVIDIA TensorRT to boost model computation, delivering a speedup ratio of
4.6x-6.1x, throughput gain ratio of 4.7x-6.3x one step further. In addition, we
design the Dynamic Stream Orchestrator (DSO) module to coordinate concurrent
requests, enhancing the system throughput performance with 1.3x improvement in
throughput and 2.3x speed-up under non-uniform distribution of upstream
candidates. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our FLAME effectively
supports large-scale online deployment of GR models and achieves remarkable
improvements in system performance.

*Lukas Breitwieser,Ahmad Hesam,Abdullah Giray Yağlıkçı,Mohammad Sadrosadati,Fons Rademakers,Onur Mutlu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces TeraAgent, a distributed agent-based simulation engine overcoming scalability challenges faced by shared-memory-based platforms, enabling extreme-scale simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address scalability limitations in simulating complex systems with billions of agents using shared-memory-based platforms like BioDynaMo, which cannot scale across multiple servers.

Method: The paper proposes a distributed simulation engine, TeraAgent, solving performance bottlenecks using tailored serialization and delta encoding techniques to efficiently transfer agent information between servers.

Result: TeraAgent achieved extreme-scale simulations with approximately 500 billion agents (84x improvement), accelerated computation with additional nodes, enhanced interoperability with third-party tools, and provided hardware flexibility.

Conclusion: TeraAgent successfully overcomes scalability issues, enabling efficient and flexible large-scale agent-based simulations across distributed systems.

Abstract: Agent-based simulation is an indispensable paradigm for studying complex
systems. These systems can comprise billions of agents, requiring the computing
resources of multiple servers to simulate. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art
platform, BioDynaMo, does not scale out across servers due to its
shared-memory-based implementation.
  To overcome this key limitation, we introduce TeraAgent, a distributed
agent-based simulation engine. A critical challenge in distributed execution is
the exchange of agent information across servers, which we identify as a major
performance bottleneck. We propose two solutions: 1) a tailored serialization
mechanism that allows agents to be accessed and mutated directly from the
receive buffer, and 2) leveraging the iterative nature of agent-based
simulations to reduce data transfer with delta encoding.
  Built on our solutions, TeraAgent enables extreme-scale simulations with half
a trillion agents (an 84x improvement), reduces time-to-result with additional
compute nodes, improves interoperability with third-party tools, and provides
users with more hardware flexibility.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes strategies for dynamic task allocation in cloud computing to maintain system stability and reduce costs while providing analytical tools and simulation results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently allocating tasks in massive cloud computing systems to avoid overloading nodes while keeping costs low.

Method: The research introduced a taxonomy of schedulers, developed an abstract model for resource utilization, experimented with virtual machine migration, created a cloud workload simulator, and examined two approaches (centralized and decentralized) for resource management.

Result: The experiments, conducted on a high-performance computing cluster, produced promising results and insights regarding load balancing strategies and resource optimization.

Conclusion: Dynamic task allocation strategies and analytical tools can enhance resource usage, maintain system stability, and reduce costs in cloud computing systems.

Abstract: Cloud computing is an established technology allowing users to share
resources on a large scale, never before seen in IT history. A cloud system
connects multiple individual servers in order to process related tasks in
several environments at the same time. Clouds are typically more cost-effective
than single computers of comparable computing performance. The sheer physical
size of the system itself means that thousands of machines may be involved. The
focus of this research was to design a strategy to dynamically allocate tasks
without overloading Cloud nodes which would result in system stability being
maintained at minimum cost. This research has added the following new
contributions to the state of knowledge: (i) a novel taxonomy and
categorisation of three classes of schedulers, namely OS-level, Cluster and Big
Data, which highlight their unique evolution and underline their different
objectives; (ii) an abstract model of cloud resources utilisation is specified,
including multiple types of resources and consideration of task migration
costs; (iii) a virtual machine live migration was experimented with in order to
create a formula which estimates the network traffic generated by this process;
(iv) a high-fidelity Cloud workload simulator, based on a month-long workload
traces from Google's computing cells, was created; (v) two possible approaches
to resource management were proposed and examined in the practical part of the
manuscript: the centralised metaheuristic load balancer and the decentralised
agent-based system. The project involved extensive experiments run on the
University of Westminster HPC cluster, and the promising results are presented
together with detailed discussions and a conclusion.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: MetaDVFS enhances Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) using a metadata-guided multi-task reinforcement learning framework, significantly improving energy efficiency, performance, and adaptation speed in heterogeneous mobile platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional heuristic-based and reinforcement learning governors struggle to manage the complexity of heterogeneous System-on-Chip designs and diverse application workloads, leading to poor generalization or high retraining costs.

Method: The authors propose a framework, MetaDVFS, that formulates DVFS as a multi-task reinforcement learning problem and utilizes metadata to uncover shared knowledge across tasks, enabling the creation of generalizable DVFS models.

Result: MetaDVFS demonstrated up to 17% improvement in Performance-Power Ratio, 26% improvement in Quality of Experience, 70.8% faster adaptation, and up to 27.6% higher performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MetaDVFS is validated as an effective and scalable solution for DVFS deployment in heterogeneous mobile systems, addressing challenges of generalization, efficiency, and deployment costs.

Abstract: Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling is essential for enhancing energy
efficiency in mobile platforms. However, traditional heuristic-based governors
are increasingly inadequate for managing the complexity of heterogeneous
System-on-Chip designs and diverse application workloads. Although
reinforcement learning approaches offer improved performance, their poor
generalization capability and reliance on extensive retraining for each
hardware and application combination leads to significant deployment costs. In
this work, we observe that device and application metadata inherently
encapsulate valuable knowledge for DVFS, presenting an opportunity to overcome
these limitations. We formulate DVFS for heterogeneous devices and applications
as a multi-task reinforcement learning problem. We introduce MetaDVFS, which is
a metadata-guided framework that systematically leverages metadata to discover
and transfer shared knowledge across DVFS tasks. MetaDVFS can output a set of
DVFS models with significant generalization capability for various applications
of heterogeneous devices. Evaluations on five Google Pixel devices running six
applications show that MetaDVFS achieves up to 17% improvement in
Performance-Power Ratio and up to 26% improvement in Quality of Experience.
Compared to state-of-the-art methods, MetaDVFS delivers 70.8% faster adaptation
and 5.8-27.6% higher performance over standalone device-application specific
training, while avoiding negative transfer effects. These results establish
MetaDVFS as an effective and scalable solution for DVFS deployment in
heterogeneous mobile environments.

*Biyao Zhang,Mingkai Zheng,Debargha Ganguly,Xuecen Zhang,Vikash Singh,Vipin Chaudhary,Zhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for predicting end-to-end training time of large language models distributed across GPUs, achieving low error rates and enabling quick iterations using only CPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models is computationally expensive and challenging due to the complexity of parallelization strategies and hardware interactions.

Method: The approach involves decomposing LLMs into computational primitives, using operator-level analysis, hardware-aware prediction models, lightweight sampling, and integrating these into an end-to-end prediction system tested on real-world HPC systems.

Result: The framework achieves prediction errors of 4.98% on Perlmutter (A100) and 9.38% on Vista (GH200) for models up to 20 billion parameters across 128 GPUs.

Conclusion: The methodology provides accurate predictions and facilitates rapid iteration on CPU-based systems, avoiding costly on-cluster experimentation.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models(LLMs) is one of the most compute-intensive
tasks in high-performance computing. Predicting end-to-end training time for
multi-billion parameter models distributed across hundreds of GPUs remains
challenging due to complex interactions between transformer components,
parallelism strategies(data, model, pipeline, tensor), and multi-tier
communication. Learned models require costly sampling, while analytical models
often struggle with real-world network and hardware complexities. We address
this by decomposing LLMs into core computational primitives and modeling them
with: (1) operator-level decomposition for fine-grained analysis; (2)
lightweight sampling based hardware-aware prediction models for key operations;
(3) an end-to-end prediction system integrating these components across complex
parallelization strategies. Crucially, our methodology has been validated on
two large-scale HPC systems. Our framework achieves low average prediction
errors-4.98\% on Perlmutter(A100) and 9.38\% on Vista(GH200)-for models up to
20B parameters across 128 GPUs. Importantly, it runs entirely on CPUs, enabling
rapid iteration over hardware configurations and training strategies without
costly on-cluster experimentation.

TL;DR: OptimES improves federated GNN training using strategies like remote neighborhood pruning, reducing large communication costs, with up to 3.5x faster convergence on dense graphs compared to EmbC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficient training and high communication costs in federated GNNs for decentralized data while preserving privacy.

Method: Implemented OptimES using remote neighborhood pruning, overlapping embeddings push, and dynamic pulling strategies to reduce network costs and enhance efficiency.

Result: OptimES speeds up convergence by up to 3.5x for dense graphs and 11x for sparser graphs compared to EmbC, with modest or better accuracy improvements observed.

Conclusion: OptimES achieves faster and efficient federated GNN training while maintaining or improving accuracy, highlighting its scalability for real-world decentralized graph data.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have experienced rapid advancements in recent
years due to their ability to learn meaningful representations from graph data
structures. However, in most real-world settings, such as financial transaction
networks and healthcare networks, this data is localized to different data
owners and cannot be aggregated due to privacy concerns. Federated Learning
(FL) has emerged as a viable machine learning approach for training a shared
model that iteratively aggregates local models trained on decentralized data.
This addresses privacy concerns while leveraging parallelism. State-of-the-art
methods enhance the privacy-respecting convergence accuracy of federated GNN
training by sharing remote embeddings of boundary vertices through a server
(EmbC). However, they are limited by diminished performance due to large
communication costs. In this article, we propose OptimES, an optimized
federated GNN training framework that employs remote neighbourhood pruning,
overlapping the push of embeddings to the server with local training, and
dynamic pulling of embeddings to reduce network costs and training time. We
perform a rigorous evaluation of these strategies for four common graph
datasets with up to $111M$ vertices and $1.8B$ edges. We see that a modest drop
in per-round accuracy due to the preemptive push of embeddings is out-stripped
by the reduction in per-round training time for large and dense graphs like
Reddit and Products, converging up to $\approx 3.5\times$ faster than EmbC and
giving up to $\approx16\%$ better accuracy than the default federated GNN
learning. While accuracy improvements over default federated GNNs are modest
for sparser graphs like Arxiv and Papers, they achieve the target accuracy
about $\approx11\times$ faster than EmbC.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper evaluates AWS and Azure FaaS workflow platforms, offering insights into their scaling, performance, and cost behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of rigorous study on FaaS workflow platforms and provide insights for developers and researchers.

Method: Conducted extensive evaluations on three FaaS platforms using 25 workflows over 132k executions.

Result: Unveiled both conventional wisdom and unique insights on execution, orchestration, scaling, and cost behaviors.

Conclusion: Guides developers on platform configurations and highlights research gaps for enhancing FaaS workflow platforms.

Abstract: Function-as-a-service (FaaS) is a popular serverless computing paradigm for
developing event-driven functions that elastically scale on public clouds. FaaS
workflows, such as AWS Step Functions and Azure Durable Functions, are composed
from FaaS functions, like AWS Lambda and Azure Functions, to build practical
applications. But, the complex interactions between functions in the workflow
and the limited visibility into the internals of proprietary FaaS platforms are
major impediments to gaining a deeper understanding of FaaS workflow platforms.
While several works characterize FaaS platforms to derive such insights, there
is a lack of a principled and rigorous study for FaaS workflow platforms, which
have unique scaling, performance and costing behavior influenced by the
platform design, dataflow and workloads. In this article, we perform extensive
evaluations of three popular FaaS workflow platforms from AWS and Azure,
running 25 micro-benchmark and application workflows over 132k invocations. Our
detailed analysis confirms some conventional wisdom but also uncovers unique
insights on the function execution, workflow orchestration, inter-function
interactions, cold-start scaling and monetary costs. Our observations help
developers better configure and program these platforms, set performance and
scalability expectations, and identify research gaps on enhancing the
platforms.

*Ankita Dutta,Nabendu Chaki,Rajat K. De*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces two pipeline parallelism frameworks, V-TiMePReSt and I-TiMePReSt, to improve DNN training across GPUs with resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the high resource requirements and inefficiencies in Deep Neural Network training across multiple GPUs, specifically the issues related to staleness and memory consumption.

Method: The study develops two interconnected frameworks: V-TiMePReSt, a staleness-free solution leveraging latest updated weights; and I-TiMePReSt, a staleness-aware method that computes intermediate weights for efficiency while reducing memory usage without relying solely on stale or latest weights.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that V-TiMePReSt excels in minimizing staleness and optimizing GPU memory, while I-TiMePReSt effectively balances GPU memory consumption and convergence speed without sacrificing weight stashing.

Conclusion: Both frameworks improve DNN training efficiency: V-TiMePReSt is ideal for staleness-free training, and I-TiMePReSt offers a balanced trade-off between memory usage and convergence speed, highlighting the significance of stale weight contributions.

Abstract: High resource requirement for Deep Neural Network (DNN) training across
multiple GPUs necessitates development of various parallelism techniques. In
this paper, we introduce two interconnected DNN training frameworks, namely,
V-TiMePReSt and I-TiMePReSt, based on pipeline parallelism, a variant of model
parallelism. V-TiMePReSt is a completely staleness-free system which enables
the DNNs to be trained on the latest updated weights in each stage of all
forward and backward passes. Developing staleness-aware systems at the expense
of weight stashing reduces GPU-memory consumption, however, increases the
number of epochs to converge. Thus, we introduce I-TiMePReSt, which is also a
staleness-aware system, but not at the expense of weight stashing. It does not
rely solely on the stale weights or the latest updated weights. I-TiMePReSt
computes an intermediate weight towards the latter and performs backward pass
on it. Additionally, we formulate the significance of the stale weights
mathematically depending on the degree of staleness. In contrast to
V-TiMePReSt, I-TiMePReSt works based on the assumption that stale weights have
a significant contribution in training, which can be quantified mathematically
based on the degree of staleness, although there are other contributory factors
which should not be ignored. Experimental results show that V-TiMePReSt is
advantageous over existing models in terms of $1)$ the extent of staleness of
the weight parameter values and $2)$ GPU memory efficiency, while I-TiMePReSt
is superior in terms of $1)$ removing staleness of the weight parameters
without removing weight stashing and $2)$ maintaining the trade-off between GPU
memory consumption and convergence speed (number of epochs).

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper presents techniques to optimize the performance of smaller Large Language Models (LLMs) on mobile Neural Processing Units (NPUs) by utilizing underused computational resources, leading to enhanced efficiency and cost-performance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying LLMs on mobile devices is challenging due to insufficient performance in smaller models and excessive resource use by larger ones. This paper aims to address the underutilization of computational resources in mobile NPUs for LLM inference.

Method: The paper introduces hardware-aware tile quantization for efficient memory access and LUT-based replacements for complex operations, designing an inference system optimized for Qualcomm Snapdragon NPUs.

Result: The method achieves significant speedups in key operations (up to 19.0 in mixed-precision GEMM and 2.2 in Softmax). Smaller models using test-time scaling exhibit accuracy matching or surpassing larger models, creating a new performance-cost frontier.

Conclusion: Optimizing mobile NPU computational capabilities enables smaller LLMs to perform effectively with reduced resources, balancing accuracy and cost for mobile platforms.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on mobile devices faces the challenge
of insufficient performance in smaller models and excessive resource
consumption in larger ones. This paper highlights that mobile Neural Processing
Units (NPUs) have underutilized computational resources, particularly their
matrix multiplication units, during typical LLM inference. To leverage this
wasted compute capacity, we propose applying parallel test-time scaling
techniques on mobile NPUs to enhance the performance of smaller LLMs. However,
this approach confronts inherent NPU challenges, including inadequate hardware
support for fine-grained quantization and low efficiency in general-purpose
computations. To overcome these, we introduce two key techniques: a
hardware-aware tile quantization scheme that aligns group quantization with NPU
memory access patterns, and efficient LUT-based replacements for complex
operations such as Softmax and dequantization. We design and implement an
end-to-end inference system that leverages the NPU's compute capability to
support test-time scaling on Qualcomm Snapdragon platforms. Experiments show
our approach brings significant speedups: up to 19.0 for mixed-precision GEMM
and 2.2 for Softmax. More importantly, we demonstrate that smaller models using
test-time scaling can match or exceed the accuracy of larger models, achieving
a new performance-cost Pareto frontier.

*Yue Zhang,Yuansheng Chen,Xuan Mo,Alex Xi,Jialun Li,WeiGang Wu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: In LLM inference serving, a two-tier architecture suffers inefficiencies due to information gaps in routing and scheduling. SynergySched introduces predictive orchestration for better SLO adherence and throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current two-tier architecture in LLM inference serving faces inefficiencies due to outdated and heuristic-based decisions, causing SLO violations and resource waste, especially in heterogeneous cloud setups.

Method: The paper introduces SynergySched, a cross-layer framework with a predictive online performance model, combining LENS for adaptive batch scheduling at the engine-layer and PRISM for state-driven routing at the cluster-layer.

Result: SynergySched achieves a 43% average improvement in SLO attainment and up to 3x throughput speedup in complex scenarios, validated in production environments like FlowGPT's clusters.

Conclusion: SynergySched significantly enhances efficiency and scalability in LLM inference serving by addressing systemic inefficiencies via predictive cross-layer coordination.

Abstract: LLM inference serving typically scales out with a two-tier architecture: a
cluster router distributes requests to multiple inference engines, each of
which then in turn performs its own internal scheduling. However, this commonly
used paradigm suffers from critical, systemic inefficiency caused by the
information gaps across two layers. At the cluster-layer, the router mainly
relies on lagging, coarse-grained metrics, such as average latency and queue
length to make decisions, resulting in "decision lag" that leads to suboptimal
request routing. At the engine-layer, static heuristic scheduling policies
cannot effectively handle the dynamic workloads, leading a poor balance between
latency and throughput. Besides, these gaps may cause SLO violations and
resource waste, especially in heterogeneous cloud environments.
  To bridge such gaps, we propose SynergySched, a cross-layer framework that
shifts LLM serving system from reactive load balancing to predictive
orchestration. The core of SynergySched lies in a structurally-informed online
performance model that provides accurate, forward-looking per-step latency and
capacity estimations. This model empowers two key components. At the
engine-layer, LENS performs SLO-aware, adaptive scheduling, dynamically
optimizing batching to meet SLOs under real-time loads. At the cluster-layer,
PRISM uses predictive signals to perform state-driven routing, maximizing
cluster-wide performance and SLO attainment. Performance evaluations show that
SynergySched improves SLO attainment by 43% on average and achieves up to 3x
throughput speedup in long-context and heterogeneous scenarios. Besides, we
also deploy SynergySched on FlowGPT's clusters to demonstrate its advantages in
production environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve communication efficiency in Federated Learning, a method that addresses data privacy concerns, especially in resource-constrained wireless networks.

Method: A three-fold strategy: 1) Adaptive Feature-Elimination Strategy to drop less important features, 2) Gradient Innovation Quantization and Error Sensitivity-Based adjustments for gradient compression, and 3) Communication Frequency Optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed methods ensure high communication efficiency while retaining model accuracy and reliable convergence.

Conclusion: The proposed strategies effectively address the communication bottleneck in Federated Learning, making it more feasible for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables participant devices to collaboratively train
deep learning models without sharing their data with the server or other
devices, effectively addressing data privacy and computational concerns.
However, FL faces a major bottleneck due to high communication overhead from
frequent model updates between devices and the server, limiting deployment in
resource-constrained wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a three-fold
strategy. Firstly, an Adaptive Feature-Elimination Strategy to drop less
important features while retaining high-value ones; secondly, Adaptive Gradient
Innovation and Error Sensitivity-Based Quantization, which dynamically adjusts
the quantization level for innovative gradient compression; and thirdly,
Communication Frequency Optimization to enhance communication efficiency. We
evaluated our proposed model's performance through extensive experiments,
assessing accuracy, loss, and convergence compared to baseline techniques. The
results show that our model achieves high communication efficiency in the
framework while maintaining accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing blockchain systems face scalability challenges due to the requirement for global execution of smart contracts, creating bottlenecks in memory access and limiting the development of novel applications.

Method: The paper proposes three innovations: Fate-Constrained Ordering (FCO) for decoupled consensus and execution, Direct Memory Architecture (DMA) for persistent virtual memory, and Universal Procedure Call (UPC) for off-chain coordination, integrated via a unified programming model.

Result: Lyquor achieves selective hosting of smart contracts while preserving global composability, eliminates state access bottlenecks, and enables scalable, fault-tolerant coordination in distributed applications.

Conclusion: Lyquor provides scalable and decentralized computation while maintaining compatibility with Ethereum APIs, addressing limitations of existing systems to advance blockchain infrastructure.

Abstract: This paper introduces Lyquor, a decentralized platform that reimagines
blockchain infrastructure through a service-centric model where nodes
selectively host smart contracts (called Lyquids) while preserving global
composability. We present three key innovations: (1) Fate-Constrained Ordering
(FCO), which decouples consensus from execution to enable selective hosting
without sacrificing Layer-1 grade composability; (2) Direct Memory Architecture
(DMA), which eliminates state access bottlenecks by providing each contract
with persistent, byte-addressable virtual memory; and (3) Universal Procedure
Call (UPC), which enables fault-tolerant, programmable coordination across
distributed off-chain computation. Together, these components are powered by a
Rust-macroed unified programming model where on-chain and off-chain logic
coexist seamlessly, supporting both traditional smart contract patterns and
novel distributed applications. Lyquor addresses critical limitations in
existing systems while maintaining compatibility with Ethereum APIs, offering a
path toward truly scalable decentralized computation.

*Bogdan-Ioan Popa,Adrian-Marius Dumitran,Livia Magureanu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper focuses on parallelizing algorithms for the One Sided Crossing Minimization (OSCM) problem to minimize edge crossings in graphs, achieving near-linear speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of exploration in parallelizing exact and fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms for OSCM, which has significant applications in areas like network visualization and VLSI design.

Method: The authors implement and analyze existing exact and FPT algorithms for OSCM in both sequential and parallel setups, evaluating their performance.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that these algorithms achieve close to linear speedup under parallelization, with a maximum speedup of nearly 19 on a 16-core, 32-thread machine.

Conclusion: Parallelization of OSCM algorithms holds significant promise, though challenges like synchronization and memory management must be addressed to achieve optimal performance.

Abstract: The One Sided Crossing Minimization (OSCM) problem is an optimization problem
in graph drawing that aims to minimize the number of edge crossings in
bipartite graph layouts. It has practical applications in areas such as network
visualization and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design, where reducing
edge crossings improves the arrangement of circuit components and their
interconnections. Despite the rise of multi-core systems, the parallelization
of exact and fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms for OSCM remains
largely unexplored. Parallel variants offer significant potential for scaling
to larger graphs but require careful handling of synchronization and memory
management. In this paper, we explore various previously studied exact and FPT
algorithms for OSCM, implementing and analyzing them in both sequential and
parallel forms. Our main contribution lies in empirically proving that these
algorithms can achieve close to linear speedup under parallelization. In
particular, our best result achieves a speedup of nearly 19 on a 16-core,
32-thread machine. We further investigate and discuss the reasons why linear
speedup is not always attained.

*Jihu Guo,Tenghui Ma,Wei Gao,Peng Sun,Jiaxing Li,Xun Chen,Yuyang Jin,Dahua Lin*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdaPtis, a system for adaptive pipeline parallelism to improve training efficiency in large language models by addressing pipeline bubbles and optimizing multiple factors jointly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies caused by pipeline bubbles in training large language models, especially with increasingly heterogeneous architectures.

Method: AdaPtis combines a pipeline performance model to predict training throughput with optimized model partitioning, placement, and workload scheduling, coupled with a unified executor for diverse strategies.

Result: AdaPtis achieves significant speedup, with a reported average of 1.42x and a maximum of 2.14x over existing methods like Megatron-LM I-1F1B across various architectures.

Conclusion: AdaPtis improves training throughput and efficiency for large language models, outperforming existing solutions through adaptive pipeline innovations.

Abstract: Pipeline parallelism is widely used to train large language models (LLMs).
However, increasing heterogeneity in model architectures exacerbates pipeline
bubbles, thereby reducing training efficiency. Existing approaches overlook the
co-optimization of model partition, model placement, and workload scheduling,
resulting in limited efficiency improvement or even performance degradation. To
respond, we propose AdaPtis, an LLM training system that supports adaptive
pipeline parallelism. First, we develop a pipeline performance model to
accurately estimate training throughput. Second, AdaPtis jointly optimizes
model partition, model placement, and workload scheduling policies guided by
this performance model. Third, we design a unified pipeline executor that
efficiently supports the execution of diverse pipeline strategies. Extensive
experiments show that AdaPtis achieves an average speedup of 1.42x (up to
2.14x) over Megatron-LM I-1F1B across various LLM architectures and scales.

*Anjus George,Michael Brim,Christopher Zimmer,David Rogers,Sarp Oral,Zach Mayes*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This study explores three data streaming architectures (Direct Streaming, Proxied Streaming, and Managed Service Streaming) implemented using the DS2HPC framework on OLCF infrastructure, evaluating their effectiveness for scientific workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the data communication needs in AI-HPC workflows by evaluating streaming solutions to balance throughput, latency, scalability, and overhead.

Method: The paper evaluates three architectures using synthetic workloads on the DS2HPC framework and SciStream toolkit through simulations on production-grade ACE infrastructure.

Result: Direct Streaming achieves the best performance in terms of throughput and latency; Managed Service Streaming offers scalability but with significant overhead, while Proxied Streaming performs well and matches Direct Streaming in many cases.

Conclusion: Direct Streaming is optimal for efficiency, Managed Service Streaming suits multi-user scalability, and Proxied Streaming offers a middle ground with competitive performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate three cross-facility data streaming
architectures, Direct Streaming (DTS), Proxied Streaming (PRS), and Managed
Service Streaming (MSS). We examine their architectural variations in data flow
paths and deployment feasibility, and detail their implementation using the
Data Streaming to HPC (DS2HPC) architectural framework and the SciStream
memory-to-memory streaming toolkit on the production-grade Advanced Computing
Ecosystem (ACE) infrastructure at Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility
(OLCF). We present a workflow-specific evaluation of these architectures using
three synthetic workloads derived from the streaming characteristics of
scientific workflows. Through simulated experiments, we measure streaming
throughput, round-trip time, and overhead under work sharing, work sharing with
feedback, and broadcast and gather messaging patterns commonly found in AI-HPC
communication motifs. Our study shows that DTS offers a minimal-hop path,
resulting in higher throughput and lower latency, whereas MSS provides greater
deployment feasibility and scalability across multiple users but incurs
significant overhead. PRS lies in between, offering a scalable architecture
whose performance matches DTS in most cases.

### [712] [RServe: Overlapping Encoding and Prefill for Efficient LMM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24381)
*Tianyu Guo,Tianming Xu,Xianjie Chen,Junru Chen,Nong Xiao,Xianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents REDServe, a new system for large multimodal model (LMM) inference that reduces latency and boosts throughput by efficiently orchestrating intra- and inter-request pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently serving large multimodal models (LMMs) is challenging due to complex inference pipelines. Traditional methods result in resource interference and fail to optimize parallelism effectively, necessitating a more efficient approach.

Method: REDServe introduces a disaggregated encoding-language model architecture with fine-grained scheduling to overlap multimodal encoding and language model computations within a single request. It also optimizes inter-request scheduling with schedulable tokens, token budgets, and chunked prefill to enhance parallelism and resource usage.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that REDServe reduces latency by up to 66% and improves throughput by up to 109%, outperforming existing LMM serving approaches.

Conclusion: REDServe significantly enhances the efficiency of LMM inference systems through advanced scheduling techniques, enabling both lower latency and higher throughput.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) typically employ an encoding module to
transform multimodal data inputs into embeddings, which are then fed to
language models for further processing. However, efficiently serving LMMs
remains highly challenging due to the inherent complexity of their inference
pipelines. Traditional serving engines co-locate the encoding module and the
language model, leading to significant resource interference and tight data
dependency. Recent studies have alleviated this issue by disaggregating the
encoding module from the model, following a design style of prefill-decode
disaggregation. Nevertheless, these approaches fail to fully exploit
parallelism both within individual requests (intra-request) and across multiple
requests (inter-request).
  To overcome the limitation, we propose REDServe, an LMM inference system that
efficiently orchestrates intra- and inter-request pipelines. REDServe is
designed to reduce low latency and maximize parallelism at both intra- and
inter-request granularities. Built on the disaggregated architecture of the
encoding module and language model, REDServe adopts a fine-grained scheduling
method that overlaps multimodal encoding with the forward computation of the
language model within a single request. For inter-request pipeline, REDServe
leverages schedulable tokens and token budgets to balance computational loads
across micro-batches. Combined with chunked prefill, this enables a novel
scheduling strategy that coordinates the execution of intra- and inter-request
pipelines. Experimental evaluations on representative LMMs show that REDServe
achieves substantial latency reduction of up to 66% while improving throughput
by up to 109%, significantly outperforming existing serving approaches.

### [713] [SparseServe: Unlocking Parallelism for Dynamic Sparse Attention in Long-Context LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24626)
*Qihui Zhou,Peiqi Yin,Pengfei Zuo,James Cheng*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces SparseServe, a system that optimizes long-context LLM serving by addressing HBM capacity bottlenecks through hierarchical HBM-DRAM management, achieving significant speed and throughput gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-context LLMs are computationally expensive due to the high demands of attention mechanisms. Dynamic sparse attention (DSA) reduces these demands, but it introduces a bottleneck in HBM capacity, limiting scalability. The paper aims to tackle this issue to enhance throughput and performance.

Method: SparseServe proposes three main innovations: (1) Fragmentation-aware KV cache transfer using efficient data movement techniques. (2) Working-set-aware batch size control to reduce HBM cache conflicts. (3) Layer-segmented prefill to manage HBM usage during initialization.

Result: Experimental results show that SparseServe offers up to 9.26x improvement in latency and up to 3.14x higher token generation throughput compared to existing systems.

Conclusion: SparseServe enables scalable and efficient serving of long-context LLMs by mitigating HBM capacity challenges through innovative hierarchical HBM-DRAM management strategies.

Abstract: Serving long-context LLMs is costly because attention computation grows
linearly with context length. Dynamic sparse attention algorithms (DSAs)
mitigate this by attending only to the key-value (KV) cache of critical tokens.
However, with DSAs, the main performance bottleneck shifts from HBM bandwidth
to HBM capacity: KV caches for unselected tokens must remain in HBM for
low-latency decoding, constraining parallel batch size and stalling further
throughput gains. Offloading these underutilized KV caches to DRAM could free
HBM capacity, allowing larger parallel batch sizes. Yet, achieving such
hierarchical HBM-DRAM storage raises new challenges, including fragmented KV
cache access, HBM cache contention, and high HBM demands of hybrid batching,
that remain unresolved in prior work.
  This paper proposes SparseServe, an LLM serving system that unlocks the
parallel potential of DSAs through efficient hierarchical HBM-DRAM management.
SparseServe introduces three key innovations to address the challenges
mentioned above: (1) fragmentation-aware KV cache transfer, which accelerates
HBM-DRAM data movement through GPU-direct loading (FlashH2D) and CPU-assisted
saving (FlashD2H); (2) working-set-aware batch size control that adjusts batch
sizes based on real-time working set estimation to minimize HBM cache
thrashing; (3) layer-segmented prefill that bounds HBM use during prefill to a
single layer, enabling efficient execution even for long prompts. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that SparseServe achieves up to 9.26x lower
mean time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency and up to 3.14x higher token generation
throughput compared to state-of-the-art LLM serving systems.

*Antian Liang,Zhigang Zhao,Kai Zhang,Xuri Shi,Chuantao Li,Chunxiao Wang,Zhenying He,Yinan Jing,X. Sean Wang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hapt, a framework tailored for efficient distributed training in heterogeneous GPU clusters, enhancing resource utilization, load balancing, and mitigating communication overheads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing heterogeneity in GPU architecture makes resource utilization during model training challenging, particularly with existing frameworks designed primarily for homogeneous clusters.

Method: Hapt employs a fine-grained planner for inter-operator parallel strategies, and a heterogeneity-aware 1F1B scheduler for better computation-communication overlap and adaptive execution timing.

Result: Hapt outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, achieving 1.3x-1.6x higher performance in heterogeneous cluster environments.

Conclusion: Hapt significantly improves distributed training in heterogeneous environments by optimizing resource usage, reducing communication overheads, and balancing loads effectively.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of GPU architectures, the heterogeneity of model
training infrastructures is steadily increasing. In such environments,
effectively utilizing all available heterogeneous accelerators becomes critical
for distributed model training. However, existing frameworks, which are
primarily designed for homogeneous clusters, often exhibit significant resource
underutilization when deployed on heterogeneous accelerators and networks. In
this paper, we present Hapt, an automated parallel training framework designed
specifically for heterogeneous clusters. Hapt introduces a fine-grained planner
that efficiently searches a wide space for the inter-operator parallel
strategy, enabling Hapt to alleviate communication overheads while maintaining
balanced loads across heterogeneous accelerators. In addition, Hapt implements
a heterogeneity-aware 1F1B scheduler that adaptively adjusts the execution
timing and ordering of microbatches based on network characteristics,
maximizing computation-communication overlap under cross-cluster interconnects
while incurring only minimal memory overhead. Our evaluation results show that
Hapt can deliver 1.3x-1.6x higher performance on heterogeneous clusters than
state-of-the-art training frameworks.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes Fed-Span, a new federated learning framework for low Earth orbit satellite networks, leveraging graph-theory and optimization for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in distributed learning for dynamic satellite networks, such as intermittent connectivity, varying computational capabilities, and changing datasets.

Method: Fed-Span employs minimum spanning tree/forest topologies for model aggregation, uses continuous constraint representations for optimization, and transforms the optimization problem into a solvable geometric programming formulation.

Result: Fed-Span achieves faster model convergence, improved energy efficiency, and reduced latency compared to existing methods, demonstrated through real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Fed-Span is an effective and novel approach for optimizing distributed learning in satellite networks, showing significant performance improvements and practical feasibility.

Abstract: We introduce Fed-Span, a novel federated/distributed learning framework
designed for low Earth orbit satellite constellations. By leveraging
graph-theoretic principles, Fed-Span addresses critical challenges inherent to
distributed learning in dynamic satellite networks, including intermittent
satellite connectivity, heterogeneous computational capabilities of satellites,
and time-varying satellites' datasets. At its core, Fed-Span builds upon
minimum spanning tree (MST) and minimum spanning forest (MSF) topologies,
enabling spanning model aggregation and dispatching processes for distributed
learning. To formalize Fed-Span, we offer a fresh perspective on MST/MSF
topologies by formulating them through a set of continuous constraint
representations (CCRs), thereby devising graph-theoretical abstractions into an
optimizable framework for satellite networks. Using these CCRs, we obtain the
energy consumption and latency of operations in Fed-Span. Moreover, we derive
novel convergence bounds for non-convex machine learning loss functions,
accommodating the key system characteristics and degrees of freedom of
Fed-Span. Finally, we propose a comprehensive optimization problem that jointly
minimizes model prediction loss, energy consumption, and latency of Fed-Span.
We unveil that this problem is NP-hard and develop a systematic approach to
transform it into a geometric programming formulation, solved via successive
convex optimization with performance guarantees. Through evaluations on
real-world datasets, we demonstrate that Fed-Span outperforms existing methods,
with faster model convergence, greater energy efficiency, and reduced latency.
These results highlight Fed-Span as a novel solution for efficient distributed
learning in satellite networks.

*Yu Han,Lehan Pan,Jie Peng,Ziyang Tao,Wuyang Zhang,Yanyong Zhang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRACE-MoE, a framework addressing communication overhead and load imbalance in Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) inference for large language models, achieving up to 3.79x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse Mixture of Experts enables scalable computation in large language models but suffers from communication and load imbalance during distributed inference.

Method: The GRACE-MoE framework consists of two phases: Grouping & Replication to manage load and reduce communication, and Locality-Aware Routing to minimize communication overhead while tackling computational load imbalance.

Result: Experiments show GRACE-MoE delivers up to 3.79x faster inference compared to current state-of-the-art systems in multi-node, multi-GPU environments.

Conclusion: GRACE-MoE provides an effective solution for improving the efficiency of SMoE inference by optimizing resource utilization and reducing latency, and its code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) performs conditional computation by
selectively activating a subset of experts, thereby enabling scalable parameter
growth in large language models (LLMs). However, the expanded parameter scale
exceeds the memory capacity of a single device, necessitating distributed
deployment for inference. This setup introduces two critical challenges: (1)
Communication Issue: Transferring features to devices with activated experts
leads to significant communication overhead. (2) Computational Load Issue:
Skewed expert activation overloads certain GPUs, resulting in load imbalance
across devices. Among these, communication overhead is identified as the main
bottleneck in SMoE inference. Nevertheless, reducing communication between
devices may exacerbate computational load imbalance, leading to device idleness
and resource waste. Therefore, we present GRACE-MoE, short for Grouping and
Replication with Locality-Aware Routing for SMoE inference. GRACE-MoE is a
co-optimization framework that jointly reduces communication overhead and
alleviates computational load imbalance. Specifically, the framework comprises
two key phases: (1) Grouping & Replication: This phase groups experts based on
their affinity to reduce cross-device communication. Additionally, dynamic
replication is applied to address load skew, improving computational load
balance across GPUs. (2) Routing: This phase employs a locality-aware routing
strategy with load prediction. It prioritizes local replicas to minimize
communication overhead and balances requests across remote replicas when
necessary. Experiments on diverse models and multi-node, multi-GPU environments
demonstrate that GRACE-MoE efficiently reduces end-to-end inference latency,
achieving up to 3.79x speedup over state-of-the-art systems. Code for GRACE-MoE
will be released upon acceptance.

*Anvitha Ramachandran,Dhruv Parikh,Viktor Prasanna*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces an FPGA accelerator to enhance the computational efficiency of Dynamic Image Graph Construction (DIGC) in Vision Graph Neural Networks by addressing memory and latency challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DIGC, a key component in Vision Graph Neural Networks, is resource-intensive and becomes a computational bottleneck, especially for high-resolution images.

Method: A streaming and deeply pipelined FPGA accelerator is proposed, featuring on-chip buffers, localized computation, efficient parallel sorting, and scalable modular architecture for DIGC across various resolutions and model variants.

Result: The FPGA accelerator achieves up to 16.6x and 6.8x speedups compared to optimized CPU and GPU DIGC baselines while supporting diverse vision backbones without compromising accuracy or flexibility.

Conclusion: The proposed FPGA-based solution significantly reduces latency for DIGC in ViGs, making high-resolution and dynamic graph construction more efficient and scalable without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (Vision GNNs, or ViGs) represent images as
unstructured graphs, achieving state of the art performance in computer vision
tasks such as image classification, object detection, and instance
segmentation. Dynamic Image Graph Construction (DIGC) builds image graphs by
connecting patches (nodes) based on feature similarity, and is dynamically
repeated in each ViG layer following GNN based patch (node) feature updates.
However, DIGC constitutes over 50% of end to end ViG inference latency, rising
to 95% at high image resolutions, making it the dominant computational
bottleneck. While hardware acceleration holds promise, prior works primarily
optimize graph construction algorithmically, often compromising DIGC
flexibility, accuracy, or generality. To address these limitations, we propose
a streaming, deeply pipelined FPGA accelerator for DIGC, featuring on chip
buffers that process input features in small, uniform blocks. Our design
minimizes external memory traffic via localized computation and performs
efficient parallel sorting with local merge sort and global k way merging
directly on streaming input blocks via heap insertion. This modular
architecture scales seamlessly across image resolutions, ViG layer types, and
model sizes and variants, and supports DIGC across diverse ViG based vision
backbones. The design achieves high clock frequencies post place and route due
to the statically configured parallelism minimizing critical path delay and
delivers up to 16.6x and 6.8x speedups over optimized CPU and GPU DIGC
baselines.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the performance of quadratic and sub-quadratic attention mechanisms on NPUs for long-context AI inference, highlighting their bottlenecks and suggesting optimization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demand for deploying large language models on edge devices with limited resources has increased, requiring efficient long-context inference methods.

Method: The authors conduct a performance analysis by benchmarking standard quadratic attention and several sub-quadratic alternatives (structured state-space and linear attention models) on NPUs.

Result: Quadratic attention is memory-bound, facing inefficiencies such as pipeline stalls, while sub-quadratic methods are compute-bound on vector cores, leading to distinct bottlenecks.

Conclusion: Hardware-aware model co-design and tailored optimization strategies are essential for enabling effective AI inference on NPUs with long-context processes.

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has driven demand for long
context inference on resource constrained edge devices. However, deploying
these models on Neural Processing Units (NPUs) presents significant challenges
due to the architectural mismatch: quadratic complexity of standard attention
mechanisms conflicts with memory and compute patterns of edge accelerators.
This paper presents a comprehensive performance analysis of various causal
inference operators on a modern NPU. We benchmark standard quadratic attention
against several sub-quadratic alternatives, including structured state-space
and linear attention models. Our analysis reveals that while sub-quadratic
methods offer superior scalability, they introduce distinct computational
bottlenecks on the NPU's specialized execution units. We identify that
quadratic attention becomes severely memory-bound, suffering from cache
inefficiency and pipeline stalls exceeding 95% at long contexts. In contrast,
sub-quadratic models can become compute-bound on programmable vector cores.
These findings provide critical insights for the co-design of hardware-aware
models and optimization strategies to enable on-device AI inference with
long-contexts.

*Pavan Reddy,Aditya Sanjay Gujral*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores localized adversarial attacks in machine learning, which manipulate specific regions of input data rather than global perturbations, and analyzes their performance, imperceptibility, and computational costs compared to standard global attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the study is the underexplored potential of localized adversarial noise in machine learning, as most adversarial research focuses on global input perturbations.

Method: The paper evaluates popular adversarial attack methods (FGSM, PGD, C&W) by introducing a binary mask to localize perturbations, analyzing metrics like pixel perturbations, PSNR, SSIM, and Attack Success Rate (ASR).

Result: Localized attacks show improved imperceptibility (higher PSNR, SSIM) and reduced pixel perturbations but require more computation and slightly lower ASR compared to global attacks. Iterative methods (PGD, C&W) outperform single-step methods (FGSM) under localization constraints.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that localized adversarial attacks provide a trade-off between effectiveness and computational cost, with iterative methods being more suitable in maintaining robustness and imperceptibility. It emphasizes their potential for advancing defensive strategies and attack methods.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in machine learning traditionally focus on global
perturbations to input data, yet the potential of localized adversarial noise
remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates localized
adversarial attacks across widely-used methods, including FGSM, PGD, and C&W,
to quantify their effectiveness, imperceptibility, and computational
efficiency. By introducing a binary mask to constrain noise to specific
regions, localized attacks achieve significantly lower mean pixel
perturbations, higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNR), and improved
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) compared to global attacks. However, these
benefits come at the cost of increased computational effort and a modest
reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results highlight that iterative
methods, such as PGD and C&W, are more robust to localization constraints than
single-step methods like FGSM, maintaining higher ASR and imperceptibility
metrics. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of localized adversarial
attacks, offering practical insights for advancing attack strategies and
designing robust defensive systems.

*Liuwang Kang,Fan Wang,Shaoshan Liu,Hung-Chyun Chou,Chuan Lin,Ning Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies in-context continual learning (ICCL), where large language models apply task scheduling and prompt rearrangement to improve multitask retention and cross-task knowledge accumulation over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional continual learning paradigms face challenges like catastrophic forgetting and the stability-plasticity dilemma. Investigating ICCL in LLMs aims to explore their adaptability for long-term retention inspired by human memory models.

Method: The study leverages Markov-Chain benchmarks alongside task scheduling and prompt rearrangement to simulate ICCL in large language models. It also uses a novel human-retention similarity metric to analyze retention dynamics.

Result: ICCL improves retention through distributed practice, revealing a 'spacing sweet spot' similar to human memory retention. Linear-attention models show human-like retention patterns but perform slightly worse than Transformer-based LLMs in retention.

Conclusion: ICCL provides a cognitively inspired, inference-only continual learning paradigm showing practical advantages for mitigating catastrophic forgetting and resolving stability-plasticity in traditional methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can adapt to new tasks via in-context learning
(ICL) without parameter updates, making them powerful learning engines for fast
adaptation. While extensive research has examined ICL as a few-shot learner,
whether it can achieve long-term retention and cross-task knowledge
accumulation when multitasks arrive sequentially remains underexplored.
Motivated by human memory studies, we investigate the retention characteristics
of ICL in multitask settings and extend it to in-context continual learning
(ICCL), where continual learning ability emerges through task scheduling and
prompt rearrangement. Experiments on Markov-Chain benchmarks demonstrate that,
for specific large-language models, ICCL benefits from distributed practice
(DP) in a manner analogous to humans, consistently revealing a spacing "sweet
spot" for retention. Beyond retention performance, we propose a human-retention
similarity metric to quantify how closely a continual-learning (CL) method
aligns with human retention dynamics. Using this metric, we show that
linear-attention models such as MAMBA and RWKV exhibit particularly human-like
retention patterns, despite their retention performance lagging behind that of
Transformer-based LLMs. Overall, our results establish ICCL as both cognitively
plausible and practically effective, providing an inference-only CL paradigm
that mitigates catastrophic forgetting and addresses the stability-plasticity
dilemma in conventional CL methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure communication efficiency, interoperability, and privacy in collaborative learning across varied model architectures.

Method: Introduced a framework requiring clients to use a common fusion-layer dimension, enabling partitioning into a personalized base block and a generalized modular block. Only fusion-layer outputs are shared.

Result: Test results showed improved communication efficiency and stable training performance compared to federated and split learning baselines.

Conclusion: The framework effectively handles model heterogeneity, ensuring privacy and achieving better communication efficiency while preserving training stability.

Abstract: Collaborative learning across heterogeneous model architectures presents
significant challenges in ensuring interoperability and preserving privacy. We
propose a communication-efficient distributed learning framework that supports
model heterogeneity and enables modular composition during inference. To
facilitate interoperability, all clients adopt a common fusion-layer output
dimension, which permits each model to be partitioned into a personalized base
block and a generalized modular block. Clients share their fusion-layer
outputs, keeping model parameters and architectures private. Experimental
results demonstrate that the framework achieves superior communication
efficiency compared to federated learning (FL) and federated split learning
(FSL) baselines, while ensuring stable training performance across
heterogeneous architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PATCH introduces a hybrid sparsity framework enabling adjustable sparsity ratios between 0%-50% for efficient LLMs deployment, achieving better accuracy and speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model pruning approaches struggle between accuracy preservation and hardware efficiency, highlighting the need for a balance between structured and unstructured sparsity.

Method: PATCH partitions weight matrices into tiles and applies a learnable mask selection mechanism to combine dense tiles with hardware-friendly 2:4 sparsity configurations.

Result: PATCH delivers 1.18x-1.38x speedups and accuracy improvements of 0.37%-2.96% on LLaMA-2 7B model compared to existing pruning methods.

Conclusion: PATCH successfully provides a flexible sparsity framework, enabling high-quality model pruning with significant speedups without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive performance but incur
prohibitive memory and compute costs at deployment. Model pruning is an
effective way to reduce these overheads, yet existing approaches face
challenges: unstructured sparsity, where nonzeros can appear anywhere,
preserves accuracy but yields irregular access patterns that prevent GPU
acceleration, while semi-structured 2:4 sparsity is hardware-friendly but
enforces a rigid 50% pattern that degrades model quality. To bridge this gap,
we introduce PATCH, a hybrid sparsity framework that enables a continuous
sparsity ratio between 0% and 50%. PATCH partitions weight matrices into tiles,
assigning each tile to be either dense or 2:4 sparse via a learnable mask
selection mechanism. This design provides fine-grained control over
accuracy-acceleration tradeoffs and supports non-uniform sparsity across
layers, leading to superior overall quality. Across models from 0.5B to 8B
parameters, PATCH consistently narrows the gap to dense accuracy while
delivering practical speedups. For instance, on LLaMA-2 7B with an A6000 GPU,
PATCH achieves 1.18x-1.38x end-to-end speedup over dense baselines while
improving accuracy by 0.37%-2.96% compared to the state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning
method, MaskLLM.

### [723] [On the Capacity of Self-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22840)
*Micah Adler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces formal scaling laws governing self-attention's ability to recover relations in tokens using the Relational Graph Recognition framework. It emphasizes how multi-head attention improves this capacity efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors wanted to understand the quantitative limits and design principles of self-attention mechanisms, focusing on how efficiently they can recover relationships between tokens.

Method: The authors derived analytical scaling laws for self-attention using the Relational Graph Recognition (RGR) framework, validated the theory through experiments, and studied the role of embedding compression and multi-head attention.

Result: The study confirmed that multi-head attention mitigates interference caused by compressed embeddings, increasing recoverable relations and aligning with the theoretical capacity scaling law.

Conclusion: The paper provides a scaling law for the capacity of self-attention layers and offers guidelines for optimizing key-query dimensions across multiple heads to maximize relational recovery.

Abstract: While self-attention is known to learn relations among tokens, we lack a
formal understanding of its capacity: how many distinct relations can a single
layer reliably recover for a given budget?
  To formalize this, we introduce Relational Graph Recognition (RGR), where the
key-query channel represents a graph on $m$ items with $m'$ directed edges,
and, given a context of items, must recover the neighbors of each item. We
measure resources by the total key dimension $D_K = h\,d_k$. Within this
framework, we analytically derive a capacity scaling law and validate it
empirically. We show that $D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ is both
necessary (information-theoretic lower bound) and sufficient (explicit
construction) in a broad class of graphs to recover $m'$ relations. This
scaling law directly leads to a new, capacity-based rationale for multi-head
attention that applies even when each item only attends to a single target.
When embeddings are uncompressed ($m = d_{\text{model}}$) and the graph is a
permutation, a single head suffices. However, compression ($m >
d_{\text{model}}$) forces relations into overlapping subspaces, creating
interference that a single large head cannot disentangle. Our analysis shows
that allocating a fixed $D_K$ across many small heads mitigates this
interference, increasing the number of recoverable relations. Controlled
single-layer experiments mirror the theory, revealing a sharp performance
threshold that matches the predicted capacity scaling and confirms the benefit
of distributing $D_K$ across multiple heads.
  Altogether, these results provide a concrete scaling law for self-attention
capacity and a principled design rule for allocating key-query budget across
heads.

*Roie Kazoom,Yuval Ratzabi,Etamar Rothstein,Ofer Hadar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a highly effective adversarial attack specifically designed for tabular data, achieving over 90% success across various models with minimal query requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial robustness in structured tabular data is less studied compared to other domains like computer vision and language, necessitating new approaches to reveal vulnerabilities.

Method: A novel black-box adversarial attack combining gradient-free direction estimation with iterative boundary search enables efficient navigation of feature spaces in tabular data.

Result: Experiments show that the attack compromises nearly the entire test set with success rates consistently above 90% across a variety of models, including classical classifiers and LLM-based systems.

Conclusion: The findings stress the urgent need for stronger defenses in tabular models used in real-world decision-making systems due to their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in structured data remains an underexplored frontier
compared to vision and language domains. In this work, we introduce a novel
black-box, decision-based adversarial attack tailored for tabular data. Our
approach combines gradient-free direction estimation with an iterative boundary
search, enabling efficient navigation of discrete and continuous feature spaces
under minimal oracle access. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
successfully compromises nearly the entire test set across diverse models,
ranging from classical machine learning classifiers to large language model
(LLM)-based pipelines. Remarkably, the attack achieves success rates
consistently above 90%, while requiring only a small number of queries per
instance. These results highlight the critical vulnerability of tabular models
to adversarial perturbations, underscoring the urgent need for stronger
defenses in real-world decision-making systems.

### [725] [Adaptive Margin RLHF via Preference over Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22851)
*Yaswanth Chittepu,Prasann Singhal,Greg Durrett,Scott Niekum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses adaptive margins in reward model learning from preferences, proposing a method called DPO-PoP leveraging preferences-over-preferences to improve classification and generative performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reward model learning often fail to consider varying strengths of preferences or rely on noisy margin data, limiting generalization and alignment fidelity. Accurate preference scores are also challenging for humans to reliably provide.

Method: The authors introduce DPO-PoP, an extension to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which uses preferences-over-preferences (ordinal signals) to infer adaptive margins on a per-datapoint basis.

Result: DPO-PoP outperforms standard DPO, DPO with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback dataset. A tradeoff is observed between improving test classification accuracy and generative quality.

Conclusion: Modeling adaptive margins via preferences-over-preferences enables better generalization but comes at a tradeoff between discriminative and generative performance. Sampling strategies are proposed to balance these aspects.

Abstract: Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and
robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning
from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF),
existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that
are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations
often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for
example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses,
or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that
modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more
faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive
margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for
humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences
over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences
reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive
margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from
preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and
generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO
with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback
dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative
and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy,
particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of
stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this
tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather
preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and
one favoring generative performance.

*Sameep Chattopadhyay,Nikhil Karamchandani,Sharayu Mohair*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework and strategies to attack online learning to rank (OLTR) algorithms, demonstrating their vulnerabilities to adversarial manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore vulnerabilities in OLTR algorithms against coordinated adversarial attacks.

Method: Designing a framework and proposing two novel attack strategies (CascadeOFA and PBMOFA) for specific OLTR algorithms, supported by theoretical and empirical analysis.

Result: Both attack strategies achieved promotion of targeted items using minimal manipulation, validated by theoretical guarantees and tests on real-world data.

Conclusion: OLTR algorithms are susceptible to adversarial attacks that can promote target items effectively, emphasizing the need for improved defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Online learning to rank (OLTR) plays a critical role in information retrieval
and machine learning systems, with a wide range of applications in search
engines and content recommenders. However, despite their extensive adoption,
the susceptibility of OLTR algorithms to coordinated adversarial attacks
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a novel framework for
attacking some of the widely used OLTR algorithms. Our framework is designed to
promote a set of target items so that they appear in the list of top-K
recommendations for T - o(T) rounds, while simultaneously inducing linear
regret in the learning algorithm. We propose two novel attack strategies:
CascadeOFA for CascadeUCB1 and PBMOFA for PBM-UCB . We provide theoretical
guarantees showing that both strategies require only O(log T) manipulations to
succeed. Additionally, we supplement our theoretical analysis with empirical
results on real-world data.

### [727] [Neighborhood Sampling Does Not Learn the Same Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22868)
*Zehao Niu,Mihai Anitescu,Jie Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores neighborhood sampling in graph neural networks, analyzing its behavior theoretically through neural tangent kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neighborhood sampling in GNNs helps control memory and computational overhead but lacks systemic understanding.

Method: Theoretical analysis using neural tangent kernels to study sampling approaches and their impact on Gaussian process-based training dynamics.

Result: Found convergence to the same posterior GP with large samples across sampling methods, but differing covariances with limited samples, showing no single sampling method dominates.

Conclusion: Different sampling methods exhibit unique properties, but no universally preferable method exists across all situations.

Abstract: Neighborhood sampling is an important ingredient in the training of
large-scale graph neural networks. It suppresses the exponential growth of the
neighborhood size across network layers and maintains feasible memory
consumption and time costs. While it becomes a standard implementation in
practice, its systemic behaviors are less understood. We conduct a theoretical
analysis by using the tool of neural tangent kernels, which characterize the
(analogous) training dynamics of neural networks based on their infinitely wide
counterparts -- Gaussian processes (GPs). We study several established
neighborhood sampling approaches and the corresponding posterior GP. With
limited samples, the posteriors are all different, although they converge to
the same one as the sample size increases. Moreover, the posterior covariance,
which lower-bounds the mean squared prediction error, is uncomparable, aligning
with observations that no sampling approach dominates.

*Karim Khamaisi,Nicolas Keller,Stefan Krummenacher,Valentin Huber,Bernhard Fässler,Bruno Rodrigues*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the effectiveness of acoustic anomaly detection methods for predictive maintenance in hydropower plants, comparing three machine learning models using real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unplanned outages in hydropower plants are expensive and challenging to address, yet existing studies rarely focus on such plants due to limited dataset availability.

Method: The paper implements preprocessing under noisy conditions, extracts time- and frequency-domain features, and benchmarks machine learning models (LSTM AE, K-Means, OC-SVM) on datasets from Rodundwerk II hydropower plant in Austria.

Result: The One-Class SVM provided the best trade-off between accuracy (ROC AUC 0.966-0.998) and training time, while the LSTM AE showed strong detection performance (ROC AUC 0.889-0.997) but required higher computational effort.

Conclusion: Predictive maintenance in hydropower plants can benefit significantly from acoustic anomaly detection, with One-Class SVM emerging as the most efficient model for practical implementation.

Abstract: In the context of industrial factories and energy producers, unplanned
outages are highly costly and difficult to service. However, existing
acoustic-anomaly detection studies largely rely on generic industrial or
synthetic datasets, with few focused on hydropower plants due to limited
access. This paper presents a comparative analysis of acoustic-based anomaly
detection methods, as a way to improve predictive maintenance in hydropower
plants. We address key challenges in the acoustic preprocessing under highly
noisy conditions before extracting time- and frequency-domain features. Then,
we benchmark three machine learning models: LSTM AE, K-Means, and OC-SVM, which
are tested on two real-world datasets from the Rodundwerk II pumped-storage
plant in Austria, one with induced anomalies and one with real-world
conditions. The One-Class SVM achieved the best trade-off of accuracy (ROC AUC
0.966-0.998) and minimal training time, while the LSTM autoencoder delivered
strong detection (ROC AUC 0.889-0.997) at the expense of higher computational
cost.

*Anutam Srinivasan,Aditya T. Vadlamani,Amin Meghrazi,Srinivasan Parthasarathy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends Conformal Fairness (CF) to the Federated Learning setting, enabling fairness auditing across demographic groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness-related gaps in Federated Learning models by integrating fairness-aware Conformal Prediction techniques.

Method: Authors extend CF and implement auditing mechanisms to evaluate fairness gaps across sensitive attributes in federated models, validating it empirically across diverse datasets.

Result: Experiments highlight fairness-related gaps across demographic groups and show how the extended CF framework can be applied effectively to federated models.

Conclusion: The extended CF framework in Federated Learning provides a method to audit and address fairness gaps, ensuring conditional coverage guarantees across subgroups.

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a widely used technique for quantifying
uncertainty in machine learning models. In its standard form, CP offers
probabilistic guarantees on the coverage of the true label, but it is agnostic
to sensitive attributes in the dataset. Several recent works have sought to
incorporate fairness into CP by ensuring conditional coverage guarantees across
different subgroups. One such method is Conformal Fairness (CF). In this work,
we extend the CF framework to the Federated Learning setting and discuss how we
can audit a federated model for fairness by analyzing the fairness-related gaps
for different demographic groups. We empirically validate our framework by
conducting experiments on several datasets spanning multiple domains, fully
leveraging the exchangeability assumption.

*Victoria Bosch,Daniel Anthes,Adrien Doerig,Sushrut Thorat,Peter König,Tim Christian Kietzmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CorText is a novel framework integrating human neural activity with large language models (LLMs) for interactive natural language processing, achieving image captioning, detailed question answering, and generalization beyond training categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to break the limitation of static and non-interactive neural decoding methods and enable dynamic and generative interaction with brain activity using LLMs.

Method: CorText integrates neural activity, specifically fMRI data, into the latent space of an LLM to allow open-ended interaction with brain data. Training involved learning patterns from fMRI data recorded during natural scene viewing.

Result: The framework generates accurate image captions and answers detailed questions using only neural data, demonstrating zero-shot generalization beyond training categories. In addition, it emulates cortical microstimulation in-silico through counterfactual analysis.

Conclusion: CorText represents a significant step from traditional non-interactive decoding methods to generative and flexible brain-data language interfaces, enhancing possibilities for human-LLM interaction.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized human-machine interaction,
and have been extended by embedding diverse modalities such as images into a
shared language space. Yet, neural decoding has remained constrained by static,
non-interactive methods. We introduce CorText, a framework that integrates
neural activity directly into the latent space of an LLM, enabling open-ended,
natural language interaction with brain data. Trained on fMRI data recorded
during viewing of natural scenes, CorText generates accurate image captions and
can answer more detailed questions better than controls, while having access to
neural data only. We showcase that CorText achieves zero-shot generalization
beyond semantic categories seen during training. Furthermore, we present a
counterfactual analysis that emulates in-silico cortical microstimulation.
These advances mark a shift from passive decoding toward generative, flexible
interfaces between brain activity and language.

*Jake S. Rhodes,Adam G. Rustad,Marshall S. Nielsen,Morgan Chase McClellan,Dallan Gardner,Dawson Hedges*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The proposed method enhances manifold alignment (MA) to work with out-of-sample data through a geometry-regularized twin autoencoder, improving cross-domain generalization and applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MA methods often fail to handle out-of-sample data, limiting their real-world application. This paper aims to overcome this limitation by improving MA techniques to generalize across domains.

Method: The authors developed a geometry-regularized twin autoencoder, combined with a multitask learning formulation and pre-trained alignment models, to enhance cross-domain generalization and maintain alignment fidelity.

Result: The proposed method showed improvements in embedding consistency, information retention, and cross-domain transfer when evaluated against multiple MA methods. It was also successfully applied to multi-modal Alzheimer's disease data, enhancing predictive accuracy with single-domain constraints.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the proposed framework improves MA's ability to generalize to unseen data and has practical utility in real-world problems, like Alzheimer's diagnosis, by leveraging multi-modal data effectively.

Abstract: Manifold alignment (MA) involves a set of techniques for learning shared
representations across domains, yet many traditional MA methods are incapable
of performing out-of-sample extension, limiting their real-world applicability.
We propose a guided representation learning framework leveraging a
geometry-regularized twin autoencoder (AE) architecture to enhance MA while
enabling generalization to unseen data. Our method enforces structured
cross-modal mappings to maintain geometric fidelity in learned embeddings. By
incorporating a pre-trained alignment model and a multitask learning
formulation, we improve cross-domain generalization and representation
robustness while maintaining alignment fidelity. We evaluate our approach using
several MA methods, showing improvements in embedding consistency, information
preservation, and cross-domain transfer. Additionally, we apply our framework
to Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, demonstrating its ability to integrate
multi-modal patient data and enhance predictive accuracy in cases limited to a
single domain by leveraging insights from the multi-modal problem.

*Jingtao Zhang,Yi Liu,Qi Shen,Changhong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces BiHDTrans, a neurosymbolic binary hyperdimensional transformer that combines HD computing with Transformer's strengths to achieve state-of-the-art efficiency and accuracy in multivariate time series classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the increasing need for efficient and accurate processing of large multivariate time series data in resource-limited edge environments, where current methods like HD computing and Transformers fall short in either temporal modeling or computational efficiency.

Method: BiHDTrans combines self-attention mechanisms from Transformers with the representational efficiency of HD computing in a neurosymbolic framework. Hardware acceleration on FPGA is used, and a binarization approach in high-dimensional space minimizes information distortion.

Result: BiHDTrans outperforms top models by 14.47% in accuracy over HD computing models and achieves better hardware performance with 39.4x lower latency than binary Transformers. It is also competitive with reduced dimensionality (64% smaller model) while maintaining high accuracy and reducing latency by 49.8%.

Conclusion: BiHDTrans effectively bridges the gap between efficient HD computing and expressive Transformers, offering a scalable, accurate, and low-latency solution for MTS classification, particularly suited for edge environments.

Abstract: The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has led to an
unprecedented volume of multivariate time series (MTS) data, requiring
efficient and accurate processing for timely decision-making in
resource-constrained edge environments. Hyperdimensional (HD) computing, with
its inherent efficiency and parallelizability, has shown promise in
classification tasks but struggles to capture complex temporal patterns, while
Transformers excel at sequence modeling but incur high computational and memory
overhead. We introduce BiHDTrans, an efficient neurosymbolic binary
hyperdimensional Transformer that integrates self-attention into the HD
computing paradigm, unifying the representational efficiency of HD computing
with the temporal modeling power of Transformers. Empirically, BiHDTrans
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) HD computing models by at least 14.47% and
achieves 6.67% higher accuracy on average than SOTA binary Transformers. With
hardware acceleration on FPGA, our pipelined implementation leverages the
independent and identically distributed properties of high-dimensional
representations, delivering 39.4 times lower inference latency than SOTA binary
Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that binarizing in holographic
high-dimensional space incurs significantly less information distortion than
directly binarizing neural networks, explaining BiHDTrans's superior accuracy.
Furthermore, dimensionality experiments confirm that BiHDTrans remains
competitive even with a 64% reduction in hyperspace dimensionality, surpassing
SOTA binary Transformers by 1-2% in accuracy with 4.4 times less model size, as
well as further reducing the latency by 49.8% compare to the full-dimensional
baseline. Together, these contributions bridge the gap between the
expressiveness of Transformers and the efficiency of HD computing, enabling
accurate, scalable, and low-latency MTS classification.

*Matthieu Zimmer,Xiaotong Ji,Tu Nguyen,Haitham Bou Ammar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to improve large language model (LLM) distillation using constrained reinforcement learning, balancing task-specific rewards and fidelity to the teacher model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditionally, LLM distillation relies on heuristics to integrate task-specific rewards, leading to suboptimal methods. Addressing this gap, the authors aim to design a disciplined framework for effective distillation within constraints.

Method: The method defines LLM distillation as a constrained reinforcement learning problem with a modified reward function to ensure constraint satisfaction. Importantly, it avoids computationally intensive approaches like dual Lagrangian methods and teacher access during deployment.

Result: Experiments show better constraint satisfaction rates and reasoning capabilities compared to traditional methods, with competitive task performance on mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a theoretically sound and computationally efficient solution for task-specific, resource-constrained LLM distillation.

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to large language model (LLM) distillation by
formulating it as a constrained reinforcement learning problem. While recent
work has begun exploring the integration of task-specific rewards into
distillation processes, existing methods typically rely on ad-hoc reward
weighting. We propose a principled optimization framework that maximizes
task-specific rewards while constraining the divergence from the teacher model
to remain below a specified threshold. Our approach adapts constrained state
augmented reinforcement learning to the distillation setting, introducing a
modified reward function that maintains theoretical guarantees of constraint
satisfaction without requiring state augmentation or teacher model access
during deployment and without the computational overhead of the dual Lagrangian
methods. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we
demonstrate that our method achieves better constraint satisfaction rates and
better reasoning compared to the soft Lagrangian relaxation baselines while
maintaining competitive task performance. Our framework provides a
theoretically grounded and practically efficient solution for reward-aware
distillation in resource-constrained settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MonoCon, a simple framework for learning robust, disentangled, and compact embeddings through monotonic functional constraints in deep metric learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the representation quality in AI by focusing on robust, efficient, and disentangled embeddings, addressing pivotal challenges in deep metric learning.

Method: The proposed MonoCon attaches a small monotonic MLP head to a pre-trained encoder, optimizing both with contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints.

Result: MonoCon generates embeddings that are 9x more compact and 1.5x more robust on CIFAR-100, with 99% classification accuracy of the baseline. On SNLI, it achieves a 3.4x compactness and 1.4x robustness improvement.

Conclusion: Functional constraints in MonoCon effectively produce highly compact and robust representations, offering broad applicability across various domains, including edge computing and retrieval systems.

Abstract: Learning high-quality, robust, efficient, and disentangled representations is
a central challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Deep metric learning
frameworks tackle this challenge primarily using architectural and optimization
constraints. Here, we introduce a third approach that instead relies on
$\textit{functional}$ constraints. Specifically, we present MonoCon, a simple
framework that uses a small monotonic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head
attached to any pre-trained encoder. Due to co-adaptation between encoder and
head guided by contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints, MonoCon learns
robust, disentangled, and highly compact embeddings at a practically negligible
performance cost. On the CIFAR-100 image classification task, MonoCon yields
representations that are nearly 9x more compact and 1.5x more robust than the
fine-tuned encoder baseline, while retaining 99\% of the baseline's 5-NN
classification accuracy. We also report a 3.4x more compact and 1.4x more
robust representation on an SNLI sentence similarity task for a marginal
reduction in the STSb score, establishing MonoCon as a general domain-agnostic
framework. Crucially, these robust, ultra-compact representations learned via
functional constraints offer a unified solution to critical challenges in
disparate contexts ranging from edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates optimal compute allocation for quantization-aware training (QAT), challenges prior findings, introduces a scaling law for predicting QAT ratios and performance, and proposes methods to save compute while enhancing accuracy of quantized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize quantization-aware training (QAT) phases for neural network accuracy and compute efficiency, addressing unclear allocation of compute between full-precision (FP) and QAT phases.

Method: Extensive experiments on various compute budgets, QAT bit widths, and model sizes. Introduced a loss scaling law and a cooldown/QAT fusion approach for efficient training strategies.

Result: Contrary to previous findings, the paper reveals that the optimal ratio of QAT to FP training increases with compute. It validates predictions using tokens-per-parameter-byte statistics and experimentally proves proposed scaling law and training methods.

Conclusion: Insights from the paper enable efficient QAT planning, predict performance and optimal ratios, and allow training higher-quality quantized models within the same compute budget, contributing to practical advancements in neural network training.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is a leading technique for improving the
accuracy of quantized neural networks. Previous work has shown that decomposing
training into a full-precision (FP) phase followed by a QAT phase yields
superior accuracy compared to QAT alone. However, the optimal allocation of
compute between the FP and QAT phases remains unclear. We conduct extensive
experiments with various compute budgets, QAT bit widths, and model sizes from
86.0M to 2.2B to investigate how different QAT durations impact final
performance. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, the
loss-optimal ratio of QAT to FP training increases with the total amount of
compute. Moreover, the optimal fraction can be accurately predicted for a wide
range of model sizes and quantization widths using the
tokens-per-parameter-byte statistic. From experimental data, we derive a loss
scaling law that predicts both optimal QAT ratios and final model performance
across different QAT/FP compute allocation strategies and QAT bit widths. We
use the scaling law to make further predictions, which we verify
experimentally, including which QAT bit width is optimal under a given memory
constraint and how QAT accuracy with different bit widths compares to
full-precision model accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel cooldown and
QAT fusion approach that performs learning rate decay jointly with
quantization-aware training, eliminating redundant full-precision model updates
and achieving significant compute savings. These findings provide practical
insights into efficient QAT planning and enable the training of higher-quality
quantized models with the same compute budget.

*Xin Qiu,Yulu Gan,Conor F. Hayes,Qiyao Liang,Elliot Meyerson,Babak Hodjat,Risto Miikkulainen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the scalability and effectiveness of evolution strategies (ES) in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), outperforming reinforcement learning (RL) in key aspects like sample efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors sought to address the underutilization of evolution strategies (ES) for fine-tuning LLMs, as it was previously considered unsuitable for larger-scale models compared to RL.

Method: They successfully scaled ES to fine-tune billions of LLM parameters and compared its efficiency and performance to RL on various metrics.

Result: ES outperformed RL in sample efficiency, robustness, resistance to reward hacking, tolerance for long-horizon rewards, and performance stability across runs.

Conclusion: The findings establish ES as a viable and superior alternative to RL for LLM fine-tuning, opening up new research opportunities in this domain.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for down-stream tasks is
a critical step in the AI deployment pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) is
arguably the most prominent fine-tuning method, contributing to the birth of
many state-of-the-art LLMs. In contrast, evolution strategies (ES), which once
showed comparable performance to RL on models with a few million parameters,
was neglected due to the pessimistic perception of its scalability to larger
models. In this work, we report the first successful attempt to scale up ES for
fine-tuning the full parameters of LLMs, showing the surprising fact that ES
can search efficiently over billions of parameters and outperform existing RL
fine-tuning methods in multiple respects, including sample efficiency,
tolerance to long-horizon rewards, robustness to different base LLMs, less
tendency to reward hacking, and more stable performance across runs. It
therefore serves as a basis to unlock a new direction in LLM fine-tuning beyond
what current RL techniques provide. The source codes are provided at:

TL;DR: The paper examines the SOAP algorithm for neural network training, comparing it with Adam and Shampoo. It demonstrates theoretical equivalency under certain conditions and finds no empirical advantage of SOAP over Adam and Shampoo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the performance and theoretical foundation of the recently introduced SOAP optimizer, and how it compares to established methods like Adam and Shampoo in neural network training.

Method: Analyzed the preconditioners of Adam, Shampoo, and SOAP from a gradient whitening perspective and established theoretical equivalence between SOAP and Shampoo under specific assumptions. Conducted empirical experiments using nanoGPT and image colorization tasks.

Result: SOAP demonstrated a similar convergence rate to Shampoo and no notable advantage over Adam and Shampoo in terms of final loss, supporting the theoretical equivalence findings.

Conclusion: The study indicates that SOAP, despite theoretical novelty, does not empirically outperform existing optimizers like Adam and Shampoo, retaining similar effectiveness in practice.

Abstract: Shampoo with Adam in the Preconditioner's eigenbasis (SOAP) has recently
emerged as a promising optimization algorithm for neural network training,
achieving superior training efficiency over both Adam and Shampoo in language
modeling tasks. In this work, we analyze Adam, Shampoo, and SOAP from the
perspective of gradient whitening, interpreting their preconditioners as
approximations to the whitening matrix, which captures second-order curvature
information. We further establish a theoretical equivalence between idealized
versions of SOAP and Shampoo under the Kronecker product assumption. To
empirically evaluate these insights, we reproduce the language modeling
experiments using nanoGPT and grayscale image colorization. Our results show
that SOAP exhibits similar convergence rate as Shampoo, and no significant
advantage over both Adam and Shampoo in the final loss achieved, which aligns
with their equivalence in theory.

*Yingshi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an evolutionary framework to train large language models efficiently by dividing models into experts, training one at a time, and using evolutionary operators for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address memory inefficiency and computational limitations when training large language models.

Method: The framework divides models into multiple experts (sub-networks) and trains one expert at a time. It employs evolutionary operations (crossover, PSO, mutation) to optimize tensor weights, leveraging the experience of the best expert for faster loss reduction.

Result: The best expert achieves accuracy comparable to the full model, reduces model size for inference, and increases training throughput over tenfold.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances training efficiency and reduces computational requirements, making it suitable for PCs and edge devices.

Abstract: This paper presents an evolutionary framework for the training of large
language models(LLM). The models are divided into several
experts(sub-networks), which have the same structure but different parameter
values. Only one expert is trained at each step. After the classical AdamW
optimization, some evolutionary operators(crossover, PSO, and mutation) act on
the tensor weights between the current expert and the best expert. So current
expert would learn the experience of best expert. The direction of best expert
would help current expert's loss decrease faster. Finally, only save the weight
of the best expert. Experiments show that best expert would achieve nearly the
same accuracy as the full model. This would greatly reduce the size of the
model for inference. Since only one expert is trained at each step, the
training needs much less memory and has much higher throughput. Experiments
show that the throughput would accelerate more than ten times! Our source code
is available. It's a pure c++/cu framework, which is suitable for easy

### [739] [SINQ: Sinkhorn-Normalized Quantization for Calibration-Free Low-Precision LLM Weights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22944)
*Lorenz K. Müller,Philippe Bich,Jiawei Zhuang,Ahmet Çelik,Luca Benfenati,Lukas Cavigelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SINQ, a novel post-training quantization method that mitigates issues in calibration-free uniform quantization, especially for low precision bit-widths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address degradation in model perplexity at low bit-widths due to precision issues caused by outliers in parameters sharing scales.

Method: Develop SINQ, adding a second-axis scale factor and employing a Sinkhorn-Knopp-style algorithm to normalize per-row and per-column variances, minimizing matrix imbalance.

Result: SINQ shows significant improvements in WikiText2 and C4 perplexity compared to existing quantization baselines on Qwen3 and DeepSeek-V2.5 models.

Conclusion: SINQ enhances post-training quantization, provides scalability to diverse architectures, and is effective in dealing with outliers. Its results are reproducible with open-source code.

Abstract: Post-training quantization has emerged as the most widely used strategy for
deploying large language models at low precision. Still, current methods show
perplexity degradation at bit-widths less than or equal to 4, partly because
representing outliers causes precision issues in parameters that share the same
scales as these outliers. This problem is especially pronounced for
calibration-free, uniform quantization methods. We introduce SINQ to augment
existing post-training quantizers with an additional second-axis scale factor
and a fast Sinkhorn-Knopp-style algorithm that finds scales to normalize
per-row and per-column variances, thereby minimizing a novel per-matrix proxy
target for quantization: the matrix imbalance. Our method has no interactions
between layers and can be trivially applied to new architectures to quantize
any linear layers. We evaluate our method on the Qwen3 model family and
DeepSeek-V2.5. SINQ improves WikiText2 and C4 perplexity significantly against
uncalibrated uniform quantization baselines and can be further enhanced by
combining it with calibration and non-uniform quantization levels. Code to
reproduce the results of this work and to easily quantize models using SINQ is
available at https://github.com/huawei-csl/SINQ.

*Hamidreza Moazzami,Asma Jamali,Nicholas Kevlahan,Rodrigo A. Vargas-Hernández*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a meta-learning framework using the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to improve data assimilation in PDE problems, specifically optimizing computational efficiency during Hessian computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dependence on costly variational DA methods in oceanic and atmospheric predictions due to computational complexity, especially involving Hessian information.

Method: Implementation of the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to approximate the inverse Hessian operator in DA problems and integrate it with the conjugate gradient (CG) method.

Result: The FNO-CG approach demonstrated a 62% reduction in average relative error and a 17% decrease in the number of iterations compared to standard CG methods, particularly excelling in ill-conditioned scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach showcases improved performance in DA problems, confirming its robustness and efficiency, notably in computationally challenging cases.

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is crucial for enhancing solutions to partial
differential equations (PDEs), such as those in numerical weather prediction,
by optimizing initial conditions using observational data. Variational DA
methods are widely used in oceanic and atmospheric forecasting, but become
computationally expensive, especially when Hessian information is involved. To
address this challenge, we propose a meta-learning framework that employs the
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to approximate the inverse Hessian operator
across a family of DA problems, thereby providing an effective initialization
for the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Numerical experiments on a linear
advection equation demonstrate that the resulting FNO-CG approach reduces the
average relative error by $62\%$ and the number of iterations by $17\%$
compared to the standard CG. These improvements are most pronounced in
ill-conditioned scenarios, highlighting the robustness and efficiency of FNO-CG
for challenging DA problems.

### [742] [GDR-learners: Orthogonal Learning of Generative Models for Potential Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22953)
*Valentyn Melnychuk,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces generative Neyman-orthogonal learners (GDR-learners) with double-robust properties to estimate conditional potential outcomes distributions, outperforming existing approaches in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep generative models for potential outcomes lack theoretical properties like Neyman-orthogonality, quasi-oracle efficiency, and double robustness.

Method: The authors propose GDR-learners that incorporate state-of-the-art generative models such as conditional normalizing flows, GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models, achieving double robustness and quasi-oracle efficiency.

Result: Experiments confirm GDR-learners outperform existing methods in estimating the conditional distributions of potential outcomes.

Conclusion: The developed GDR-learners are theoretically favorable, asymptotically optimal, and practically effective for observational data modeling.

Abstract: Various deep generative models have been proposed to estimate potential
outcomes distributions from observational data. However, none of them have the
favorable theoretical property of general Neyman-orthogonality and, associated
with it, quasi-oracle efficiency and double robustness. In this paper, we
introduce a general suite of generative Neyman-orthogonal (doubly-robust)
learners that estimate the conditional distributions of potential outcomes. Our
proposed GDR-learners are flexible and can be instantiated with many
state-of-the-art deep generative models. In particular, we develop GDR-learners
based on (a) conditional normalizing flows (which we call GDR-CNFs), (b)
conditional generative adversarial networks (GDR-CGANs), (c) conditional
variational autoencoders (GDR-CVAEs), and (d) conditional diffusion models
(GDR-CDMs). Unlike the existing methods, our GDR-learners possess the
properties of quasi-oracle efficiency and rate double robustness, and are thus
asymptotically optimal. In a series of (semi-)synthetic experiments, we
demonstrate that our GDR-learners are very effective and outperform the
existing methods in estimating the conditional distributions of potential
outcomes.

*Luke Guerdan,Justin Whitehouse,Kimberly Truong,Kenneth Holstein,Zhiwei Steven Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to estimate the quality of Generative AI systems by addressing evaluation biases using a combination of human ratings and persona-based LLM ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in the validity of Generative AI evaluations between lab settings and real-world conditions, stemming from differences in the source and target distributions of human raters and associated biases.

Method: The paper proposes a doubly-robust estimation framework that uses persona ratings—simulated by prompting LLMs to behave as raters with specific sociodemographic traits—and combines these ratings with biased human ratings to correct the bias.

Result: The framework is shown to produce statistically valid system quality estimates under certain conditions, supported by theoretical validation and a simulated test environment (Persona Simulation Framework).

Conclusion: The authors present a solid approach to mitigating evaluation biases, offering a reliable way to integrate imperfect but informative persona-based LLM ratings with biased human ratings to generate valid quality measures for GenAI systems.

Abstract: As Generative AI (GenAI) systems see growing adoption, a key concern involves
the external validity of evaluations, or the extent to which they generalize
from lab-based to real-world deployment conditions. Threats to the external
validity of GenAI evaluations arise when the source sample of human raters and
system outputs used to obtain a system quality estimate differs from the target
distribution at deployment time. In this work, we propose a doubly-robust
estimation framework designed to address this evaluation sampling bias. Key to
our approach is the use of "persona" ratings produced by prompting an LLM
evaluator (i.e., an LLM-as-a-judge) to behave as a human rater with specific
sociodemographic characteristics. Our doubly-robust framework combines these
informative yet imperfect persona ratings with human ratings obtained under
evaluation sampling bias to produce statistically valid system quality
estimates. In particular, we show that our approach yields valid system quality
estimates when either (i) a model trained to predict human ratings using
persona ratings and source data observed under sampling bias, or (ii) a
reweighting model that corrects for sampling bias is of sufficient quality. We
validate our framework theoretically and via a novel Persona Simulation
Framework (PSF) designed to systematically manipulate persona quality and the
degree of evaluation sampling bias present in source data. Our work provides a
principled foundation for combining imperfect persona ratings with human
ratings observed under sampling bias to obtain valid system quality estimates.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using discrete diffusion models to address scalability issues in reinforcement learning for large action spaces and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning struggles with large, combinatorial action spaces, limiting effectiveness in real-world applications.

Method: The paper introduces a framework to train discrete diffusion models as policies, using policy mirror descent to define regularized target policy distributions and employing distributional matching for stable and efficient learning.

Result: Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results, improved sample efficiency, and superior performance across diverse combinatorial benchmarks.

Conclusion: The diffusion-based policy framework stabilizes learning and enhances performance, providing a powerful solution for complex reinforcement learning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) struggles to scale to large, combinatorial action
spaces common in many real-world problems. This paper introduces a novel
framework for training discrete diffusion models as highly effective policies
in these complex settings. Our key innovation is an efficient online training
process that ensures stable and effective policy improvement. By leveraging
policy mirror descent (PMD) to define an ideal, regularized target policy
distribution, we frame the policy update as a distributional matching problem,
training the expressive diffusion model to replicate this stable target. This
decoupled approach stabilizes learning and significantly enhances training
performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results and superior sample
efficiency across a diverse set of challenging combinatorial benchmarks,
including DNA sequence generation, RL with macro-actions, and multi-agent
systems. Experiments demonstrate that our diffusion policies attain superior
performance compared to other baselines.

### [745] [Functional Critic Modeling for Provably Convergent Off-Policy Actor-Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22964)
*Qinxun Bai,Yuxuan Han,Wei Xu,Zhengyuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel actor-critic (AC) framework for off-policy reinforcement learning that addresses challenges like instability and inefficiency using functional critic modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Off-policy RL with actor-critic methods faces challenges such as instability from the 'deadly triad,' moving target issues, and inefficient actor learning, which stem from difficulties in policy evaluation and gradient estimation.

Method: The authors propose a functional critic modeling approach, supported by a neural network architecture, to stabilize and improve actor-critic learning. They also provide theoretical convergence analysis under linear function settings.

Result: The proposed framework achieves provable convergence in linear settings and shows promising performance in preliminary experiments on DeepMind Control Benchmark RL tasks.

Conclusion: The novel AC framework with functional critic modeling effectively addresses core challenges in off-policy RL, achieving theoretical convergence and practical efficacy.

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation offers an
effective way to improve sample efficiency by reusing past experience. Within
this setting, the actor-critic (AC) framework has achieved strong empirical
success. However, both the critic and actor learning is challenging for the
off-policy AC methods: first of all, in addition to the classic "deadly triad"
instability of off-policy evaluation, it also suffers from a "moving target"
problem, where the policy being evaluated changes continually; secondly, actor
learning becomes less efficient due to the difficulty of estimating the exact
off-policy policy gradient. The first challenge essentially reduces the problem
to repeatedly performing off-policy evaluation for changing policies. For the
second challenge, the off-policy policy gradient theorem requires a complex and
often impractical algorithm to estimate an additional emphasis critic, which is
typically neglected in practice, thereby reducing to the on-policy policy
gradient as an approximation. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of
functional critic modeling, which leads to a new AC framework that addresses
both challenges for actor-critic learning under the deadly triad setting. We
provide a theoretical analysis in the linear function setting, establishing the
provable convergence of our framework, which, to the best of our knowledge, is
the first convergent off-policy target-based AC algorithm. From a practical
perspective, we further propose a carefully designed neural network
architecture for the functional critic modeling and demonstrate its
effectiveness through preliminary experiments on widely used RL tasks from the
DeepMind Control Benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of clustering multi-dimensional functional data, which involves capturing complex nonlinear relationships and handling phase variations.

Method: Develop a universal-approximator encoder-decoder framework with regularization strategies and a clustering loss integrated into the training objective.

Result: Experimental validation indicates effective clustering and reconstruction of both Euclidean and manifold-valued functional data.

Conclusion: FAEclust is a robust pipeline with universal approximation properties, offering improved stability and clustering-resistant phase variations for functional data.

Abstract: We introduce FAEclust, a novel functional autoencoder framework for cluster
analysis of multi-dimensional functional data, data that are random
realizations of vector-valued random functions. Our framework features a
universal-approximator encoder that captures complex nonlinear
interdependencies among component functions, and a universal-approximator
decoder capable of accurately reconstructing both Euclidean and manifold-valued
functional data. Stability and robustness are enhanced through innovative
regularization strategies applied to functional weights and biases.
Additionally, we incorporate a clustering loss into the network's training
objective, promoting the learning of latent representations that are conducive
to effective clustering. A key innovation is our shape-informed clustering
objective, ensuring that the clustering results are resistant to phase
variations in the functions. We establish the universal approximation property
of our non-linear decoder and validate the effectiveness of our model through
extensive experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving large language models' ability to convert natural language into optimization models, specifically in mixed-integer linear programming, by integrating domain expertise and refining data and strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the high barrier posed by mathematical programming, which is skill-intensive and requires expert knowledge. Automating this process can help make optimization more accessible and efficient across domains.

Method: The authors clean training data using error analysis, categorize optimization mistakes into classes, and implement multi-turn inference strategies. They guide LLMs with class-specific feedback and iterative refinement using solver feedback.

Result: Their method improves formulation accuracy by 14 percentage points on average across multiple base LLMs.

Conclusion: Integrating domain expertise and refining training data significantly enhance the capability of LLMs for mathematical programming tasks and pave the way for robust automation in optimization formulation.

Abstract: Mathematical programming -- the task of expressing operations and
decision-making problems in precise mathematical language -- is fundamental
across domains, yet remains a skill-intensive process requiring operations
research expertise. Recent advances in large language models for complex
reasoning have spurred interest in automating this task, translating natural
language into executable optimization models. Current approaches, however,
achieve limited accuracy, hindered by scarce and noisy training data without
leveraging domain knowledge. In this work, we systematically integrate
optimization expertise to improve formulation accuracy for mixed-integer linear
programming, a key family of mathematical programs. Our approach first cleans
training data through class-based error analysis to explicitly prevent common
mistakes within each optimization class. We then develop multi-turn inference
strategies that guide LLMs with class-specific error summaries and solver
feedback, enabling iterative refinement. Experiments across multiple base LLMs
demonstrate that combining cleaned data with domain-informed prompting and
feedback improves formulation accuracy by 14 percentage points on average,
enabling further progress toward robust LLM-assisted optimization formulation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for expressive modeling capabilities in multi-stage stochastic programs, particularly in structured MDPs with continuous spaces and decision-dependent uncertainties.

Result: The authors demonstrate the expressiveness of their modeling approach through diverse, increasingly complex examples and present novel solution methods for practical application.

Conclusion: The paper advances the field by enhancing the modeling and solving of complex stochastic programs, making them more applicable to real-world problems with continuous state-action spaces and uncertainties.

Abstract: We study a class of multi-stage stochastic programs, which incorporate
modeling features from Markov decision processes (MDPs). This class includes
structured MDPs with continuous state and action spaces. We extend policy
graphs to include decision-dependent uncertainty for one-step transition
probabilities as well as a limited form of statistical learning. We focus on
the expressiveness of our modeling approach, illustrating ideas with a series
of examples of increasing complexity. As a solution method, we develop new

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T-Tamer introduces a general framework for optimizing performance in multi-model serving, revealing that recall (revisiting earlier models) is crucial for achieving provable accuracy-latency trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning serving scenarios face complex trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and resource usage, which are particularly challenging in multi-model systems.

Method: The study models multi-model serving as a multi-stage decision process and proves the necessity of recall-based strategies for optimal trade-offs with theoretical guarantees.

Result: Experiments on synthetic datasets and benchmarks in vision and NLP demonstrate that recall-based strategies outperform heuristic methods in managing accuracy-latency trade-offs.

Conclusion: Recall-based approaches provide foundational principles and performance guarantees for designing multi-model systems, addressing current limitations in heuristics.

Abstract: As machine learning models continue to grow in size and complexity, efficient
serving faces increasingly broad trade-offs spanning accuracy, latency,
resource usage, and other objectives. Multi-model serving further complicates
these trade-offs; for example, in cascaded models, each early-exit decision
balances latency reduction against potential accuracy loss. Despite the
pervasiveness and importance of such trade-offs, current strategies remain
largely heuristic and case-specific, limiting both their theoretical guarantees
and general applicability.
  We present a general framework, T-Tamer, which formalizes this setting as a
multi-stage decision process, where the objective is to determine both when to
exit and which model to consult. Our main result shows that recall (i.e., the
ability to revisit earlier models) is both necessary and sufficient for
achieving provable performance guarantees. In particular, we prove that
strategies without recall cannot obtain any constant-factor approximation to
the optimal trade-off, whereas recall-based strategies provably attain the
optimal trade-off in polynomial time.
  We validate our analysis through experiments on synthetic datasets and
early-exit workloads for vision and NLP benchmarks. The results show that
recall-based strategies consistently yield efficient accuracy-latency
trade-offs. We hope this work provides a principled foundation for bridging
heuristic practice with theoretical guarantees in the design of early-exit and
cascaded models.

*Zachary Baker,Yuxiao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces variational Sparse Autoencoders (vSAE) to improve feature organization and interpretability in neural network representations but finds that these methods underperform compared to standard Sparse Autoencoders (SAE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether integrating variational methods into Sparse Autoencoders can enhance feature organization and interpretability of neural network activations.

Method: The authors developed vSAE by replacing deterministic ReLU gating with stochastic sampling from Gaussian posteriors and adding KL divergence regularization. They evaluated vSAE against standard SAE using benchmarks like SAE Bench, feature analysis, and t-SNE visualization.

Result: vSAE underperforms standard SAE in core metrics but performs better in feature independence and ablation analysis. However, excessive KL divergence regularization leads to many non-functional ("dead") features.

Conclusion: Naively applying variational methods to Sparse Autoencoders does not enhance feature organization or interpretability; excessive regularization compromises performance.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for
interpreting neural network representations by learning sparse,
human-interpretable features from dense activations. We investigate whether
incorporating variational methods into SAE architectures can improve feature
organization and interpretability. We introduce the variational Sparse
Autoencoder (vSAE), which replaces deterministic ReLU gating with stochastic
sampling from learned Gaussian posteriors and incorporates KL divergence
regularization toward a standard normal prior. Our hypothesis is that this
probabilistic sampling creates dispersive pressure, causing features to
organize more coherently in the latent space while avoiding overlap. We
evaluate a Topk vSAE against a standard TopK SAE on Pythia-70M transformer
residual steam activations using comprehensive benchmarks including SAE Bench,
individual feature interpretability analysis, and global latent space
visualization through t-SNE. The vSAE underperforms standard SAE across core
evaluation metrics, though excels at feature independence and ablation metrics.
The KL divergence term creates excessive regularization pressure that
substantially reduces the fraction of living features, leading to observed
performance degradation. While vSAE features demonstrate improved robustness,
they exhibit many more dead features than baseline. Our findings suggest that
naive application of variational methods to SAEs does not improve feature
organization or interpretability.

*Zijian Wang,Xiaofei Zhang,Xin Zhang,Yukun Liu,Qiong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evolves federated learning (FL) by enabling the central server to not only build global models but also guide new tasks to suitable clients using an empirical likelihood-based framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of statistical heterogeneity in FL systems, particularly in domains like healthcare, where data privacy and client functionalities require smart allocation and guidance of resources.

Method: It introduces a novel FL paradigm where the central server guides the allocation of tasks by using an empirical likelihood-based framework aimed at simultaneously learning local models and matching queries to ideal clients.

Result: Empirical results prove the proposed framework's ability to improve model accuracy and guide client-task allocation better than existing FL algorithms.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundation for intelligent FL systems that view client heterogeneity as a strength, opening doors for resource-efficient and domain-optimized applications, especially in healthcare.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is increasingly adopted in domains like healthcare,
where data privacy is paramount. A fundamental challenge in these systems is
statistical heterogeneity-the fact that data distributions vary significantly
across clients (e.g., different hospitals may treat distinct patient
demographics). While current FL algorithms focus on aggregating model updates
from these heterogeneous clients, the potential of the central server remains
under-explored. This paper is motivated by a healthcare scenario: could a
central server not only build a model but also guide a new patient to the
hospital best equipped for their specific condition? We generalize this idea to
propose a novel paradigm for FL systems where the server actively guides the
allocation of new tasks or queries to the most appropriate client in the
network. To enable this, we introduce an empirical likelihood-based framework
that simultaneously addresses two goals: (1) learning effective local models on
each client, and (2) finding the best matching client for a new query.
Empirical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on benchmark
datasets, showing improvements in both model accuracy and the precision of
client guidance compared to standard FL approaches. This work opens a new
direction for building more intelligent and resource-efficient federated
systems that leverage heterogeneity as a feature, not just a bug. Code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new definition of calibration error for multiclass predictors, enabling calibration with polynomial samples for most cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of calibrating multiclass predictors due to the complex nature of prediction values.

Method: Proposed a novel interpolation definition of calibration error and applied adaptive data analysis techniques to improve sample efficiency.

Result: Achieved calibration for predictors across a range of interpolation with polynomial sample complexity, and optimized error parameter dependence at one endpoint.

Conclusion: The approach improves calibration methods for multiclass predictors, minimizing sample complexity and enhancing performance compared to prior work.

Abstract: Calibrating a multiclass predictor, that outputs a distribution over labels,
is particularly challenging due to the exponential number of possible
prediction values. In this work, we propose a new definition of calibration
error that interpolates between two established calibration error notions, one
with known exponential sample complexity and one with polynomial sample
complexity for calibrating a given predictor. Our algorithm can calibrate any
given predictor for the entire range of interpolation, except for one endpoint,
using only a polynomial number of samples. At the other endpoint, we achieve
nearly optimal dependence on the error parameter, improving upon previous work.
A key technical contribution is a novel application of adaptive data analysis
with high adaptivity but only logarithmic overhead in the sample complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in detecting illicit activities in blockchain networks while ensuring models are effective against noise, imbalance, and adversarial behavior.

Method: The method involves a soft voting ensemble of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN), enhanced by quantum-ready design hooks for future adaptability.

Result: The ensemble framework achieves high recall of illicit transactions with a false positive rate below 1%, outperforming individual models and baseline methods using the Elliptic dataset.

Conclusion: Ensemble GNNs provide immediate utility for anti-money laundering (AML) enforcement and create a foundation for quantum-enhanced financial security applications.

Abstract: Blockchain Business applications and cryptocurrencies such as enable secure,
decentralized value transfer, yet their pseudonymous nature creates
opportunities for illicit activity, challenging regulators and exchanges in
anti money laundering (AML) enforcement. Detecting fraudulent transactions in
blockchain networks requires models that can capture both structural and
temporal dependencies while remaining resilient to noise, imbalance, and
adversarial behavior. In this work, we propose an ensemble framework that
integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) to enhance blockchain fraud detection.
Using the real-world Elliptic dataset, our tuned soft voting ensemble achieves
high recall of illicit transactions while maintaining a false positive rate
below 1%, beating individual GNN models and baseline methods. The modular
architecture incorporates quantum-ready design hooks, allowing seamless future
integration of quantum feature mappings and hybrid quantum classical graph
neural networks. This ensures scalability, robustness, and long-term
adaptability as quantum computing technologies mature. Our findings highlight
ensemble GNNs as a practical and forward-looking solution for real-time
cryptocurrency monitoring, providing both immediate AML utility and a pathway
toward quantum-enhanced financial security analytics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN), a neural network model capable of learning the dynamics of multiple systems without prior knowledge of system configurations, leveraging physical principles for better interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural network models for physical systems are typically limited to single systems with fixed parameters and require prior knowledge of system configuration space. The paper aims to overcome these limitations by developing a model that can generalize to multiple systems and unknown configurations.

Method: The SPS-GAN combines a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module with a conditional GAN backbone to model physical dynamics. It includes a novel optimization term encouraging sparse representation to discover system configuration space from arbitrary data types.

Result: SPS-GAN successfully predicts trajectories, generates videos, and discovers symmetries, achieving results comparable to supervised models tailored for single systems.

Conclusion: SPS-GAN expands the applicability of neural networks in modeling physical systems, allowing for generalization across different systems and configurations without requiring prior configuration knowledge. The method leverages physical laws for accurate and interpretable predictions.

Abstract: From metronomes to celestial bodies, mechanics underpins how the world
evolves in time and space. With consideration of this, a number of recent
neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to
encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical.
However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a
single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of
a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space
GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and
generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not
require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can
discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary
measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve
physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds
a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To
discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional

encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate
the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry
discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on
par with supervised models designed for single systems.

### [755] [MoE-PHDS: One MoE checkpoint for flexible runtime sparsity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23012)
*Lauren. A Hannah,Soheil Zibakhsh,Kumari Nishu,Arnav Kundu,Mohammad Samragh Razlighi,Mehrdad Farajtabar,Minsik Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoE-PHDS, a method enabling pretrained sparse Mixtures of Experts (MoEs) to adjust sparsity levels post hoc, simplifying runtime deployment and eliminating the need for multiple models for different efficiency targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training multiple MoE models for various efficiency targets increases complexity, cost, and limits operational flexibility in different latency and energy requirements.

Method: MoE-PHDS employs post hoc declared sparsity, leveraging mixed sparsity-level training and a short curriculum at high sparsity without altering model architecture.

Result: Experiments show PHDS matches or outperforms oracle models, enhances cross-sparsity agreement by up to 22%, and provides predictable accuracy/latency tradeoffs from one model.

Conclusion: PHDS enables practitioners to adjust sparsity at inference time, streamlining deployment and offering flexible control over model efficiency without needing separate models.

Abstract: Sparse Mixtures of Experts (MoEs) are typically trained to operate at a fixed
sparsity level, e.g. $k$ in a top-$k$ gating function. This global sparsity
level determines an operating point on the accuracy/latency curve; currently,
meeting multiple efficiency targets means training and maintaining multiple
models. This practice complicates serving, increases training and maintenance
costs, and limits flexibility in meeting diverse latency, efficiency, and
energy requirements. We show that pretrained MoEs are more robust to runtime
sparsity shifts than commonly assumed, and introduce MoE-PHDS ({\bf P}ost {\bf
H}oc {\bf D}eclared {\bf S}parsity), a lightweight SFT method that turns a
single checkpoint into a global sparsity control surface. PHDS mixes training
across sparsity levels and anchors with a short curriculum at high sparsity,
requiring no architectural changes. The result is predictable accuracy/latency
tradeoffs from one model: practitioners can ``dial $k$'' at inference time
without swapping checkpoints, changing architecture, or relying on token-level
heuristics. Experiments on OLMoE-1B-7B-0125, Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, and proprietary
models fit on multiple operating points show that PHDS matches or exceeds
well-specified oracle models, improves cross-sparsity agreement by up to 22\%
vs. well-specified oracle models, and enables simplified, flexible runtime MoE
deployment by making global sparsity a first-class serving primitive.

### [756] [On the Sheafification of Higher-Order Message Passing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23020)
*Jacob Hume,Pietro Liò*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how sheaf theory can generalize graph learning's message-passing to higher-order relational structures using the sheaf Laplacian, extending prior work in Topological Deep Learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitation of the Hodge Laplacian's opaque and potentially degenerate biases in correlating data features and topological features at higher dimensions in Topological Deep Learning.

Method: The authors use sheaf theory to formalize and extend higher-order message passing by leveraging the sheaf Laplacian, which introduces a data-aware inductive bias through dimension-$k$ sheaf cohomology.

Result: The paper extends prior theory of sheaf diffusion in graph learning ($k=0$) to higher dimensions ($k>0$) and addresses the limitations of previous formulations in this context.

Conclusion: Sheaf theory provides a principled and expressive formalism for advancing higher-order message passing in Topological Deep Learning, overcoming the limitations of the Hodge Laplacian in higher dimensions.

Abstract: Recent work in Topological Deep Learning (TDL) seeks to generalize graph
learning's preeminent $message \ passing$ paradigm to more complex relational
structures: simplicial complexes, cell complexes, hypergraphs, and combinations
thereof. Many approaches to such ${higher\text{-}order \ message \ passing}$
(HOMP) admit formulation in terms of nonlinear diffusion with the Hodge
(combinatorial) Laplacian, a graded operator which carries an inductive bias
that dimension-$k$ data features correlate with dimension-$k$ topological
features encoded in the (singular) cohomology of the underlying domain. For
$k=0$ this recovers the graph Laplacian and its well-studied homophily bias. In
higher gradings, however, the Hodge Laplacian's bias is more opaque and
potentially even degenerate. In this essay, we position sheaf theory as a
natural and principled formalism for modifying the Hodge Laplacian's
diffusion-mediated interface between local and global descriptors toward more
expressive message passing. The sheaf Laplacian's inductive bias correlates
dimension-$k$ data features with dimension-$k$ $sheaf$ cohomology, a data-aware
generalization of singular cohomology. We will contextualize and novelly extend
prior theory on sheaf diffusion in graph learning ($k=0$) in such a light --
and explore how it fails to generalize to $k>0$ -- before developing novel
theory and practice for the higher-order setting. Our exposition is accompanied
by a self-contained introduction shepherding sheaves from the abstract to the
applied.

### [757] [FedAgentBench: Towards Automating Real-world Federated Medical Image Analysis with Server-Client LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23803)
*Pramit Saha,Joshua Strong,Divyanshu Mishra,Cheng Ouyang,J. Alison Noble*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of running federated learning (FL) systems in real-world healthcare by introducing an agent-driven framework. It evaluates the ability of large language model (LLM) agents to automate FL processes across various healthcare modalities and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the operational challenges in deploying federated learning systems in healthcare scenarios, such as client selection, data preprocessing, and algorithm selection, which currently require substantial human effort.

Method: The authors introduce an agent-driven FL framework, FedAgentBench, and evaluate it against 201 datasets covering multiple healthcare modalities. They use 14 open-source and 10 proprietary LLMs to automate FL setup and pipeline stages. The framework integrates 40 FL algorithms tailored to specific tasks.

Result: The evaluation reveals that while some LLM agents like GPT-4.1 can automate basic FL stages, more complex interdependent tasks remain challenging, even for advanced models.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential and limitations of agentic LLMs in automating federated learning workflows for healthcare, demonstrating progress but underlining the need for further advancement in handling complex tasks.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative model training across healthcare
sites without sharing sensitive patient data. However, real-world FL deployment
is often hindered by complex operational challenges that demand substantial
human efforts. This includes: (a) selecting appropriate clients (hospitals),
(b) coordinating between the central server and clients, (c) client-level data
pre-processing, (d) harmonizing non-standardized data and labels across
clients, and (e) selecting FL algorithms based on user instructions and
cross-client data characteristics. However, the existing FL works overlook
these practical orchestration challenges. These operational bottlenecks
motivate the need for autonomous, agent-driven FL systems, where intelligent
agents at each hospital client and the central server agent collaboratively
manage FL setup and model training with minimal human intervention. To this
end, we first introduce an agent-driven FL framework that captures key phases
of real-world FL workflows from client selection to training completion and a
benchmark dubbed FedAgentBench that evaluates the ability of LLM agents to
autonomously coordinate healthcare FL. Our framework incorporates 40 FL
algorithms, each tailored to address diverse task-specific requirements and
cross-client characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a diverse set of
complex tasks across 201 carefully curated datasets, simulating 6
modality-specific real-world healthcare environments, viz., Dermatoscopy,
Ultrasound, Fundus, Histopathology, MRI, and X-Ray. We assess the agentic
performance of 14 open-source and 10 proprietary LLMs spanning small, medium,
and large model scales. While some agent cores such as GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3
can automate various stages of the FL pipeline, our results reveal that more
complex, interdependent tasks based on implicit goals remain challenging for
even the strongest models.

*Melody Zixuan Li,Kumar Krishna Agrawal,Arna Ghosh,Komal Kumar Teru,Adam Santoro,Guillaume Lajoie,Blake A. Richards*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how large language models' learned representations evolve geometrically during training and post-training using spectral metrics. They identify three distinct phases with implications for model performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the emergence of complex capabilities in large language models and explain it using representational geometry, as traditional training metrics like loss fail to capture this.

Method: The authors analyze the geometry of learned representations during training and post-training using spectral metrics such as effective rank (RankMe) and eigenspectrum decay (α-ReQ) in autoregressive pretraining settings.

Result: They identify three consistent geometric phases: 'warmup,' 'entropy-seeking,' and 'compression-seeking,' each associated with specific representational and performance characteristics. Post-training methods induce further geometric changes impacting in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance.

Conclusion: The study links the geometry of learned representations to the training process and post-training modifications, revealing fundamental patterns in optimization dynamics and their implications for various performance metrics.

Abstract: Standard training metrics like loss fail to explain the emergence of complex
capabilities in large language models. We take a spectral approach to
investigate the geometry of learned representations across pretraining and
post-training, measuring effective rank (RankMe) and eigenspectrum decay
($\alpha$-ReQ). With OLMo (1B-7B) and Pythia (160M-12B) models, we uncover a
consistent non-monotonic sequence of three geometric phases during
autoregressive pretraining. The initial "warmup" phase exhibits rapid
representational collapse. This is followed by an "entropy-seeking" phase,
where the manifold's dimensionality expands substantially, coinciding with peak
n-gram memorization. Subsequently, a "compression-seeking" phase imposes
anisotropic consolidation, selectively preserving variance along dominant
eigendirections while contracting others, a transition marked with significant
improvement in downstream task performance. We show these phases can emerge
from a fundamental interplay of cross-entropy optimization under skewed token
frequencies and representational bottlenecks ($d \ll |V|$). Post-training
further transforms geometry: SFT and DPO drive "entropy-seeking" dynamics to
integrate specific instructional or preferential data, improving
in-distribution performance while degrading out-of-distribution robustness.
Conversely, RLVR induces "compression-seeking", enhancing reward alignment but
reducing generation diversity.

*Yuke Li,Yujia Zheng,Tianyi Xiong,Zhenyi Wang,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses catastrophic forgetting in machine learning by proposing a novel framework that formulates the problem as an identification issue. It aims to quantify forgetting and mitigate interference through shared latent representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of catastrophic interference in machine learning, which disrupts the performance of models on previously learned tasks when adapting to new ones.

Method: The method involves a two-stage training strategy with maximum likelihood estimation for latent representation learning and KL divergence optimization to identify shared latent variables between different setups.

Result: The results demonstrate theoretical guarantees and empirical improvements in mitigating catastrophic forgetting across synthetic and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The study concludes that learning shared latent representations using the proposed approach effectively reduces catastrophic interference, offering consistent theoretical and practical benefits.

Abstract: Catastrophic interference, also known as catastrophic forgetting, is a
fundamental challenge in machine learning, where a trained learning model
progressively loses performance on previously learned tasks when adapting to
new ones. In this paper, we aim to better understand and model the catastrophic
interference problem from a latent representation learning point of view, and
propose a novel theoretical framework that formulates catastrophic interference
as an identification problem. Our analysis demonstrates that the forgetting
phenomenon can be quantified by the distance between partial-task aware (PTA)
and all-task aware (ATA) setups. Building upon recent advances in
identifiability theory, we prove that this distance can be minimized through
identification of shared latent variables between these setups. When learning,
we propose our method \ourmeos with two-stage training strategy: First, we
employ maximum likelihood estimation to learn the latent representations from
both PTA and ATA configurations. Subsequently, we optimize the KL divergence to
identify and learn the shared latent variables. Through theoretical guarantee
and empirical validations, we establish that identifying and learning these
shared representations can effectively mitigate catastrophic interference in
machine learning systems. Our approach provides both theoretical guarantees and
practical performance improvements across both synthetic and benchmark
datasets.

*Alexander Tyurin,Andrei Spiridonov,Varvara Rudenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two new asynchronous distributed RL algorithms (Rennala NIGT and Malenia NIGT) addressing computational and communication inefficiencies in heterogeneous and homogeneous settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve distributed reinforcement learning techniques, especially under asynchronous computations and heterogeneous environments which are underexplored and hinder efficiency.

Method: The authors propose two algorithms—Rennala NIGT for homogeneous setups and Malenia NIGT for heterogeneous setups—focusing on asynchronous policy gradient aggregation and demonstrating theoretical improvements.

Result: Both methods show enhanced computational and communication efficiency, surpassing previous benchmarks under varying conditions, backed by experimental evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms advance distributed RL by handling asynchronous and heterogeneous system intricacies, offering better efficiency and performance.

Abstract: We study distributed reinforcement learning (RL) with policy gradient methods
under asynchronous and parallel computations and communications. While
non-distributed methods are well understood theoretically and have achieved
remarkable empirical success, their distributed counterparts remain less
explored, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous asynchronous
computations and communication bottlenecks. We introduce two new algorithms,
Rennala NIGT and Malenia NIGT, which implement asynchronous policy gradient
aggregation and achieve state-of-the-art efficiency. In the homogeneous
setting, Rennala NIGT provably improves the total computational and
communication complexity while supporting the AllReduce operation. In the
heterogeneous setting, Malenia NIGT simultaneously handles asynchronous
computations and heterogeneous environments with strictly better theoretical
guarantees. Our results are further corroborated by experiments, showing that
our methods significantly outperform prior approaches.

*Yang Lv,Jin Cao,Ben Niu,Zhe Sun,Fengwei Wang,Fenghua Li,Hui Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel federated learning (FL) framework that integrates personalized differential privacy (DP) and adaptive neural architecture search (NAS) to address data sensitivity and heterogeneity challenges in edge intelligence for 6G networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle two major challenges in federated learning for edge devices in the context of 6G networks: (1) the risk of data reconstruction from parameter sharing and (2) difficulty in adapting a unified global model to diverse local data distributions.

Method: The framework employs sample-level representations for knowledge sharing and a personalized DP strategy to protect training data while resisting reconstruction attacks. Additionally, a privacy-aware NAS algorithm is developed to create locally optimized model architectures and hyperparameters under privacy constraints.

Result: Through experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, the proposed framework achieved a 6.82% increase in accuracy compared to the PerFedRLNAS method, reduced model size to one-tenth, and decreased communication cost to one-twentieth.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a privacy-preserving and efficient solution for federated learning in heterogeneous edge environments, with strong privacy guarantees and significant improvements in model performance and resource efficiency.

Abstract: The Sixth-Generation (6G) network envisions pervasive artificial intelligence
(AI) as a core goal, enabled by edge intelligence through on-device data
utilization. To realize this vision, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a
key paradigm for collaborative training across edge devices. However, the
sensitivity and heterogeneity of edge data pose key challenges to FL: parameter
sharing risks data reconstruction, and a unified global model struggles to
adapt to diverse local distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel
federated learning framework that integrates personalized differential privacy
(DP) and adaptive model design. To protect training data, we leverage
sample-level representations for knowledge sharing and apply a personalized DP
strategy to resist reconstruction attacks. To ensure distribution-aware
adaptation under privacy constraints, we develop a privacy-aware neural
architecture search (NAS) algorithm that generates locally customized
architectures and hyperparameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first personalized DP solution tailored for representation-based FL with
theoretical convergence guarantees. Our scheme achieves strong privacy
guarantees for training data while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
methods in model performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our scheme improves accuracy by 6.82\%
over the federated NAS method PerFedRLNAS, while reducing model size to 1/10
and communication cost to 1/20.

*Javad Forough,Mohammad Maheri,Hamed Haddadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GuardNet, a hierarchical filtering framework designed to detect and mitigate jailbreak attacks on large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jailbreak attacks on LLMs can bypass alignment constraints and lead to harmful behaviors, posing risks in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. Current defenses are insufficient, necessitating more robust solutions.

Method: GuardNet uses structured graphs combining sequential links, syntactic dependencies, and token relations. It employs graph neural networks for both prompt-level and token-level filtering to detect and address adversarial prompts.

Result: GuardNet shows significant improvements, achieving nearly perfect F$_1$ scores (up to 99.8%) in detecting jailbreak prompts on key datasets and substantial gains in token-level analysis with IoU increases up to +28%.

Conclusion: GuardNet outperforms prior defenses, maintains acceptable latency, and shows strong generalization across domains, making it a practical solution for mitigating jailbreak threats in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly susceptible to jailbreak
attacks, which are adversarial prompts that bypass alignment constraints and
induce unauthorized or harmful behaviors. These vulnerabilities undermine the
safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of LLM outputs, posing critical risks
in domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal compliance. In this paper, we
propose GuardNet, a hierarchical filtering framework that detects and filters
jailbreak prompts prior to inference. GuardNet constructs structured graphs
that combine sequential links, syntactic dependencies, and attention-derived
token relations to capture both linguistic structure and contextual patterns
indicative of jailbreak behavior. It then applies graph neural networks at two
levels: (i) a prompt-level filter that detects global adversarial prompts, and
(ii) a token-level filter that pinpoints fine-grained adversarial spans.
Extensive experiments across three datasets and multiple attack settings show
that GuardNet substantially outperforms prior defenses. It raises prompt-level
F$_1$ scores from 66.4\% to 99.8\% on LLM-Fuzzer, and from 67-79\% to over 94\%
on PLeak datasets. At the token level, GuardNet improves F$_1$ from 48-75\% to
74-91\%, with IoU gains up to +28\%. Despite its structural complexity,
GuardNet maintains acceptable latency and generalizes well in cross-domain
evaluations, making it a practical and robust defense against jailbreak threats
in real-world LLM deployments.

*Saleh Bunaiyan,Corentin Delacour,Shuvro Chowdhury,Kyle Lee,Kerem Y. Camsari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces IsingFormer, a Transformer-based model that generates uncorrelated global proposals for spin configurations, accelerating sampling and optimization processes in Monte Carlo methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) struggles with slow mixing near critical points and in rugged landscapes, limiting its efficiency in both sampling and optimization.

Method: IsingFormer generates global spin configurations resembling target distributions using a Transformer trained on equilibrium samples, integrating these as Metropolis step proposals in Parallel Tempering (PT).

Result: IsingFormer effectively reduces equilibration time in 2D Ising models, finds lower-energy states in 3D spin glasses, and improves success rates in integer factorization tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various instances.

Conclusion: The work shows the potential of neural proposals, like IsingFormer, to accelerate Monte Carlo methods by capturing global structure, enhancing both sampling speed and optimization performance across families of problems.

Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and
combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough
landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across
temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its
configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium
samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the
target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for
global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual
single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces
magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures,
including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces
equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses
(optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy
states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes.
Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems,
IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to
unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution.
Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize
across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move
beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer
demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by
neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and
stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.

*Lin Long,Changdae Oh,Seongheon Park,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how large vision-language models (LVLMs) balance text-based patterns with visual evidence, revealing a critical layer for visual integration and proposing a metric to evaluate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how visual information influences large vision-language models (LVLMs) is crucial to addressing their tendency to rely excessively on language prior (LP) while underutilizing visual evidence.

Method: The study examines the layer-wise representation dynamics within LVLMs through chain-of-embedding. It identifies a Visual Integration Point (VIP) and proposes the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator to measure the effect of visual queries.

Result: The analysis spans 9 LVLMs and 6 benchmark datasets, showing consistent emergence of VIP and reliability of TVI in predicting LP strength.

Conclusion: The findings provide a systematic framework for diagnosing and understanding language prior in LVLMs, contributing to improved multimodal model performance.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal
tasks, yet they often default to their language prior (LP) -- memorized textual
patterns from pre-training while under-utilizing visual evidence. Prior
analyses of LP mostly rely on input-output probing, which fails to reveal the
internal mechanisms governing when and how vision influences model behavior. To
address this gap, we present the first systematic analysis of language prior
through the lens of chain-of-embedding, which examines the layer-wise
representation dynamics within LVLMs. Our analysis reveals a universal
phenomenon: each model exhibits a Visual Integration Point (VIP), a critical
layer at which visual information begins to meaningfully reshape hidden
representations and influence decoding. Building on this observation, we
introduce the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator, which aggregates
representation distance beyond the VIP to quantify how strongly visual query
influences response generation. Across 54 model-dataset combinations spanning 9
contemporary LVLMs and 6 benchmarks, we demonstrate that VIP consistently
emerges, and that TVI reliably predicts the strength of language prior. This
offers a principled toolkit for diagnosing and understanding language prior in
LVLMs.

*Matt L. Sampson,Peter Melchior*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new learning rate scheduler for neural networks based on a dynamical system model that optimizes long-term validation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning rate schedules are limited either by their simplicity (being parametric) or short-term reactive nature, lacking a holistic approach informed by the entire training process.

Method: The proposed scheduler uses hyperparameter search data to learn a latent representation of training dynamics and predicts effective learning rate schedules for neural network training.

Result: The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in image classification (with CNNs and ResNets) and next-token prediction (with transformers), leading to models located in flatter loss landscapes and better generalization.

Conclusion: This computationally efficient and optimizer-agnostic scheduler offers better generalization, and its potential for layering atop ML platforms makes it a practical innovation for neural network training.

Abstract: The learning rate schedule is one of the most impactful aspects of neural
network optimization, yet most schedules either follow simple parametric
functions or react only to short-term training signals. None of them are
supported by a comprehensive temporal view of how well neural networks actually
train. We present a new learning rate scheduler that models the training
performance of neural networks as a dynamical system. It leverages training
runs from a hyperparameter search to learn a latent representation of the
training process. Given current training metrics, it predicts the future
learning rate schedule with the best long-term validation performance. Our
scheduler generalizes beyond previously observed training dynamics and creates
specialized schedules that deviate noticeably from common parametric functions.
It achieves SOTA results for image classification with CNN and ResNet models as
well as for next-token prediction with a transformer model. The trained models
are located in flatter regions of the loss landscape and thus provide better
generalization than those trained with other schedules. Our method is
computationally efficient, optimizer-agnostic, and can easily be layered on top
of ML experiment-tracking platforms. An implementation of our scheduler will be
made available after acceptance.

*Christopher Scarvelis,Justin Solomon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a closed-form method to estimate the directional derivatives of a diffusion model without retraining, using black-box access to the pre-trained model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict changes in a diffusion model's predictions under perturbations to the training data without costly retraining.

Method: Directional derivatives estimation is performed using a closed-form procedure involving black-box access to a pre-trained score model and its input derivatives.

Result: The method estimates sensitivity of diffusion model outputs to perturbations in the target measure with robust correlation to changes post-retraining.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient sensitivity analysis and enhances understanding of diffusion model behavior under training data modifications.

Abstract: Training a diffusion model approximates a map from a data distribution $\rho$
to the optimal score function $s_t$ for that distribution. Can we differentiate
this map? If we could, then we could predict how the score, and ultimately the
model's samples, would change under small perturbations to the training set
before committing to costly retraining. We give a closed-form procedure for
computing this map's directional derivatives, relying only on black-box access
to a pre-trained score model and its derivatives with respect to its inputs. We
extend this result to estimate the sensitivity of a diffusion model's samples
to additive perturbations of its target measure, with runtime comparable to
sampling from a diffusion model and computing log-likelihoods along the sample
path. Our method is robust to numerical and approximation error, and the
resulting sensitivities correlate with changes in an image diffusion model's
samples after retraining and fine-tuning.

### [767] [Beyond Model Ranking: Predictability-Aligned Evaluation for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23074)
*Wanjin Feng,Yuan Yuan,Jingtao Ding,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diagnostic framework for time series forecasting that aligns model evaluation with the inherent predictability of data, offering metrics to better assess and compare models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time series forecasting metrics do not adequately separate model performance from data unpredictability, leading to flawed comparisons and limited insights into model behavior.

Method: Proposed a framework featuring Spectral Coherence Predictability (SCP) for assessing data difficulty and Linear Utilization Ratio (LUR) for measuring a model's use of predictable information.

Result: The framework identifies 'predictability drift'—variations in forecast difficulty over time—and reveals trade-offs wherein complex models excel on unpredictable data while linear models excel on predictable data.

Conclusion: The study calls for predictability-aware evaluation approaches to enhance model comparisons, improve fairness, and deepen understanding of forecasting models.

Abstract: In the era of increasingly complex AI models for time series forecasting,
progress is often measured by marginal improvements on benchmark leaderboards.
However, this approach suffers from a fundamental flaw: standard evaluation
metrics conflate a model's performance with the data's intrinsic
unpredictability. To address this pressing challenge, we introduce a novel,
predictability-aligned diagnostic framework grounded in spectral coherence. Our
framework makes two primary contributions: the Spectral Coherence
Predictability (SCP), a computationally efficient ($O(N\log N)$) and
task-aligned score that quantifies the inherent difficulty of a given
forecasting instance, and the Linear Utilization Ratio (LUR), a
frequency-resolved diagnostic tool that precisely measures how effectively a
model exploits the linearly predictable information within the data. We
validate our framework's effectiveness and leverage it to reveal two core
insights. First, we provide the first systematic evidence of "predictability
drift", demonstrating that a task's forecasting difficulty varies sharply over
time. Second, our evaluation reveals a key architectural trade-off: complex
models are superior for low-predictability data, whereas linear models are
highly effective on more predictable tasks. We advocate for a paradigm shift,
moving beyond simplistic aggregate scores toward a more insightful,
predictability-aware evaluation that fosters fairer model comparisons and a
deeper understanding of model behavior.

*Chandan Tankala,Krishnakumar Balasubramanian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends Dense Associative Memories (DAMs) from vector spaces to probability distributions, particularly focusing on the Bures-Wasserstein space of Gaussian densities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome limitations in traditional DAMs, which are restricted to vector representations, and incorporate probability distributions for richer data modeling.

Method: The proposed framework uses a log-sum-exp energy function over distributions and a retrieval mechanism based on optimal transport maps weighted by Gibbs distribution, relying on Wasserstein geometry.

Result: The authors demonstrate exponential storage capacity, retrieval guarantees under Wasserstein perturbations, and validate their framework on both synthetic and real-world distributional tasks.

Conclusion: This work advances the capabilities of associative memories by enabling the storage and retrieval of probability distributions, bridging a gap between classical models and modern generative modeling, with applications in memory-augmented learning.

Abstract: Dense associative memories (DAMs) store and retrieve patterns via
energy-functional fixed points, but existing models are limited to vector
representations. We extend DAMs to probability distributions equipped with the
2-Wasserstein distance, focusing mainly on the Bures-Wasserstein class of
Gaussian densities. Our framework defines a log-sum-exp energy over stored
distributions and a retrieval dynamics aggregating optimal transport maps in a
Gibbs-weighted manner. Stationary points correspond to self-consistent
Wasserstein barycenters, generalizing classical DAM fixed points. We prove
exponential storage capacity, provide quantitative retrieval guarantees under
Wasserstein perturbations, and validate the model on synthetic and real-world

*Reza Rahimi Azghan,Gautham Krishna Gudur,Mohit Malu,Edison Thomaz,Giulia Pedrielli,Pavan Turaga,Hassan Ghasemzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLAD-Net is a continual learning framework combining transformers and CNNs to address catastrophic forgetting in human activity recognition using wearable sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address distribution shifts and catastrophic forgetting in continual learning scenarios for human activity recognition, compounded by label scarcity.

Method: CLAD-Net employs a self-supervised transformer for global pattern recognition and a supervised CNN with knowledge distillation for task-specific fine-tuning.

Result: The framework achieves 91.36% accuracy with minimal forgetting on PAMAP2, outperforming baselines, and performs well in semi-supervised settings with limited labeled data.

Conclusion: CLAD-Net effectively supports continual learning in HAR by addressing real-world challenges like distribution shifts and label scarcity, surpassing existing methods.

Abstract: The rise of deep learning has greatly advanced human behavior monitoring
using wearable sensors, particularly human activity recognition (HAR). While
deep models have been widely studied, most assume stationary data distributions
- an assumption often violated in real-world scenarios. For example, sensor
data from one subject may differ significantly from another, leading to
distribution shifts. In continual learning, this shift is framed as a sequence
of tasks, each corresponding to a new subject. Such settings suffer from
catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge deteriorates as new tasks are
learned. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and inconsistency of
labeled data in human studies. To address these issues, we propose CLAD-Net
(Continual Learning with Attention and Distillation), a framework enabling
wearable-sensor models to be updated continuously without sacrificing
performance on past tasks. CLAD-Net integrates a self-supervised transformer,
acting as long-term memory, with a supervised Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) trained via knowledge distillation for activity classification. The
transformer captures global activity patterns through cross-attention across
body-mounted sensors, learning generalizable representations without labels.
Meanwhile, the CNN leverages knowledge distillation to retain prior knowledge
during subject-wise fine-tuning. On PAMAP2, CLAD-Net achieves 91.36 percent
final accuracy with only 8.78 percent forgetting, surpassing memory-based and
regularization-based baselines such as Experience Replay and Elastic Weight
Consolidation. In semi-supervised settings with only 10-20 percent labeled
data, CLAD-Net still delivers strong performance, demonstrating robustness to
label scarcity. Ablation studies further validate each module's contribution.

*Andrey Kharitenko,Zebang Shen,Riccardo de Santi,Niao He,Florian Doerfler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses optimization on manifolds implicitly defined by data distributions, introducing methods that leverage generative AI score functions to recover essential geometry operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Riemannian optimization assumes access to explicit geometric operations on manifolds, which is often not practical when manifolds are only implicitly defined through data.

Method: The authors introduce a link function to connect data distributions to geometric operations. They propose algorithms, DLF and DRGD, leveraging diffusion model techniques for manifold adherence and effective optimization.

Result: The proposed algorithms show strong performance in optimizing tasks over data-driven manifolds, demonstrated through control applications with theoretical guarantees for feasibility and optimality.

Conclusion: Linking implicit manifolds to explicit optimization tools through generative AI represents a promising approach for solving modern data-driven design problems, with practical applications shown through experiments.

Abstract: Under the data manifold hypothesis, high-dimensional data are concentrated
near a low-dimensional manifold. We study the problem of Riemannian
optimization over such manifolds when they are given only implicitly through
the data distribution, and the standard manifold operations required by
classical algorithms are unavailable. This formulation captures a broad class
of data-driven design problems that are central to modern generative AI. Our
key idea is to introduce a link function that connects the data distribution to
the geometric operations needed for optimization. We show that this function
enables the recovery of essential manifold operations, such as retraction and
Riemannian gradient computation. Moreover, we establish a direct connection
between our construction and the score function in diffusion models of the data
distribution. This connection allows us to leverage well-studied
parameterizations, efficient training procedures, and even pretrained score
networks from the diffusion model literature to perform optimization. Building
on this foundation, we propose two efficient inference-time algorithms --
Denoising Landing Flow (DLF) and Denoising Riemannian Gradient Descent (DRGD)
-- and provide theoretical guarantees for both feasibility (approximate
manifold adherence) and optimality (small Riemannian gradient norm). Finally,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on finite-horizon reference
tracking tasks in data-driven control, highlighting its potential for practical
generative and design applications.

*Hyunwoo Lee,Hayoung Choi,Hyunju Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study proposes a new class of odd sigmoid activation functions and a tailored initialization method to optimize trainability and expressivity in neural networks, overcoming limitations like variance collapse and saturation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the adverse effects of nonlinear activations combined with suboptimal initialization resulting in issues like saturation and variance collapse, and improve trainability without the reliance on normalization layers.

Method: The authors introduce a class of odd sigmoid activation functions and a closed-form initialization method, ensuring proper noise scaling for dispersion of forward activations up to a target layer.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates reliable training without normalization layers, improved data efficiency, and success in learning with activation functions that fail with traditional initialization methods.

Conclusion: Tailoring initialization to specific activation functions resolves critical trainability bottlenecks, enabling broader adoption of nonlinearities in neural networks and improving convergence and learning efficiency.

Abstract: Activation functions critically influence trainability and expressivity, and
recent work has therefore explored a broad range of nonlinearities. However,
activations and weight initialization are interdependent: without an
appropriate initialization method, nonlinearities can cause saturation,
variance collapse, and increased learning rate sensitivity. We address this by
defining an odd sigmoid function class and, given any activation f in this
class, proposing an initialization method tailored to f. The method selects a
noise scale in closed form so that forward activations remain well dispersed up
to a target layer, thereby avoiding collapse to zero or saturation.
Empirically, the approach trains reliably without normalization layers,
exhibits strong data efficiency, and enables learning for activations under
which standard initialization methods (Xavier, He, Orthogonal) often do not
converge reliably.

*Steve Hong,Runa Eschenhagen,Bruno Mlodozeniec,Richard Turner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of Hessian approximation quality on influence-function attributions for model prediction tracing, highlighting that better approximations yield improved data attribution performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unclear relationship between Hessian approximation quality and data attribution performance for influence functions in deep learning.

Method: Experimentation in a controlled classification setting to analyze the effect of Hessian approximation methods like GGN and K-FAC on influence-function attributions.

Result: Better Hessian approximations consistently improve influence score quality. K-FAC eigenvalue mismatches account for significant attribution errors.

Conclusion: Improved Hessian approximation enhances data attribution accuracy while guiding future efforts to balance computational efficiency and precision.

Abstract: Influence functions offer a principled way to trace model predictions back to
training data, but their use in deep learning is hampered by the need to invert
a large, ill-conditioned Hessian matrix. Approximations such as Generalised
Gauss-Newton (GGN) and Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) have
been proposed to make influence computation tractable, yet it remains unclear
how the departure from exactness impacts data attribution performance.
Critically, given the restricted regime in which influence functions are
derived, it is not necessarily clear better Hessian approximations should even
lead to better data attribution performance. In this paper, we investigate the
effect of Hessian approximation quality on influence-function attributions in a
controlled classification setting. Our experiments show that better Hessian
approximations consistently yield better influence score quality, offering
justification for recent research efforts towards that end. We further
decompose the approximation steps for recent Hessian approximation methods and
evaluate each step's influence on attribution accuracy. Notably, the mismatch
between K-FAC eigenvalues and GGN/EK-FAC eigenvalues accounts for the majority
of the error and influence loss. These findings highlight which approximations
are most critical, guiding future efforts to balance computational tractability
and attribution accuracy.

*Deshu Chen,Yuchen Liu,Zhijian Zhou,Chao Qu,Yuan Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Distributional Flow Critic (DFC), a novel reinforcement learning critic architecture designed to model the full state-action return distribution, outperforming scalar estimates in stability and informativeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottleneck caused by traditional critics in reinforcement learning that use single scalar estimates, which limit the potential of flow-based policies in modeling complex, multimodal behaviors.

Method: The Distributional Flow Critic (DFC) employs flow matching to model return distributions as continuous transformations from base distributions to target distributions, providing more detailed and stable learning signals for reinforcement learning policies.

Result: Experiments on D4RL and OGBench benchmarks show that DFC achieves strong performance, particularly on tasks requiring multimodal action distributions, and excels in offline and offline-to-online fine-tuning compared to standard methods.

Conclusion: DFC enhances the learning capabilities of flow-based policies by providing a richer and more stable critic, improving outcomes in reinforcement learning tasks that involve complex return distributions.

Abstract: Flow-based policies have recently emerged as a powerful tool in offline and
offline-to-online reinforcement learning, capable of modeling the complex,
multimodal behaviors found in pre-collected datasets. However, the full
potential of these expressive actors is often bottlenecked by their critics,
which typically learn a single, scalar estimate of the expected return. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Distributional Flow Critic (DFC), a
novel critic architecture that learns the complete state-action return
distribution. Instead of regressing to a single value, DFC employs flow
matching to model the distribution of return as a continuous, flexible
transformation from a simple base distribution to the complex target
distribution of returns. By doing so, DFC provides the expressive flow-based
policy with a rich, distributional Bellman target, which offers a more stable
and informative learning signal. Extensive experiments across D4RL and OGBench
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance,
especially on tasks requiring multimodal action distributions, and excels in
both offline and offline-to-online fine-tuning compared to existing methods.

*Ziheng Cheng,Zhong Li,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Evolved Sampling (ES) is a dynamic data selection method that accelerates training time while maintaining model performance through batch-level sampling based on loss dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to speed up training processes without sacrificing model performance by selecting data samples that are most informative for the learning process.

Method: The proposed ES framework dynamically samples data at the batch level during training, leveraging loss dynamics and augmented loss differences. A variation called ESWP incorporates set-level selection for further acceleration.

Result: ES achieves significant time savings of up to 45% on wall-clock time while maintaining training performance, demonstrating consistent results across various tasks.

Conclusion: ES provides a simple, extensible framework for lossless training acceleration, highlighting the potential of improving data efficiency in large-scale machine learning.

Abstract: Data selection is designed to accelerate learning with preserved performance.
To achieve this, a fundamental thought is to identify informative data samples
with significant contributions to the training. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Evolved Sampling} (\textbf{ES}), a simple yet effective framework for
\emph{dynamic} sampling along the training process. This method conducts \em
batch \em level data selection based on the dynamics of losses and augmented
\emph{loss differences}, which enables flexible \emph{frequency tuning}, and
hence significantly reduces the back propagation time with maintained model
performance. Due to its conciseness, ES is also readily extensible to
incorporate \em set \em level data selection (to form ES with pruning,
\textbf{ESWP}) for further accelerations. As a plug-and-play framework, ES(WP)
consistently achieves lossless training accelerations across various
pre-training and post-training tasks, saving up to nearly 45\% wall-clock time.
Our results motivate further investigations on the data efficiency aspect of
modern large-scale machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the latent knowledge encoded in NFMs and identify limitations not apparent through downstream task evaluations.

Method: A three-part evaluation framework: Embedding Geometry Analysis, Metric Alignment Assessment, and Causal Sensitivity Testing, applied across four NFMs and five network datasets.

Result: Significant model issues were discovered, such as anisotropy, inconsistent feature sensitivity, and payload dependency. Addressing these limitations improved performance by up to +0.35 F1 score.

Conclusion: Current NFMs exhibit latent issues that hinder their full potential. Systematic evaluation and addressing highlighted limitations can enhance model performance without architectural changes.

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into the latent knowledge
encoded within Network Foundation Models (NFMs) that focuses on hidden
representations analysis rather than pure downstream task performance.
Different from existing efforts, we analyze the models through a three-part
evaluation: Embedding Geometry Analysis to assess representation space
utilization, Metric Alignment Assessment to measure correspondence with
domain-expert features, and Causal Sensitivity Testing to evaluate robustness
to protocol perturbations. Using five diverse network datasets spanning
controlled and real-world environments, we evaluate four state-of-the-art NFMs,
revealing that they all exhibit significant anisotropy, inconsistent feature
sensitivity patterns, an inability to separate the high-level context, payload
dependency, and other properties. Our work identifies numerous limitations
across all models and demonstrates that addressing them can significantly
improve model performance (by up to +0.35 $F_1$ score without architectural
changes).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the generalization error of group-invariant neural networks, finding that symmetry encoding can improve approximation accuracy and generalization under specific conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the statistical advantages of incorporating group-invariant structures in neural networks, especially in learning symmetric target functions.

Method: Analyzing the generalization error within the Barron framework and studying the effects of group-invariant structures on approximation rates and Rademacher complexity.

Result: Incorporating group symmetries introduces a factor ($\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}$), which can significantly enhance accuracy when small. Symmetry encoding does not negatively affect estimation error but provides benefits for symmetric functions.

Conclusion: Group-invariant neural networks offer statistical advantages for learning symmetric target functions, supported by theoretical analyses and illustrative examples.

Abstract: We investigate the generalization error of group-invariant neural networks
within the Barron framework. Our analysis shows that incorporating
group-invariant structures introduces a group-dependent factor
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma} \le 1$ into the approximation rate. When this factor
is small, group invariance yields substantial improvements in approximation
accuracy. On the estimation side, we establish that the Rademacher complexity
of the group-invariant class is no larger than that of the non-invariant
counterpart, implying that the estimation error remains unaffected by the
incorporation of symmetry. Consequently, the generalization error can improve
significantly when learning functions with inherent group symmetries. We
further provide illustrative examples demonstrating both favorable cases, where
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx |G|^{-1}$, and unfavorable ones, where
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx 1$. Overall, our results offer a rigorous
theoretical foundation showing that encoding group-invariant structures in
neural networks leads to clear statistical advantages for symmetric target
functions.

### [777] [Revisiting Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Missing Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23494)
*Jie Yang,Yifan Hu,Kexin Zhang,Luyang Niu,Yushun Dong,Philip S. Yu,Kaize Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of multivariate time series forecasting with missing values by proposing a direct prediction framework called CRIB, which avoids the conventional imputation-then-prediction approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantitative forecasting with missing data is essential because real-world time series often contain missing values, and the commonly used imputation-then-prediction approach leads to errors due to the lack of ground truth for missing values.

Method: The authors introduce the Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB) framework, which leverages a unified-variate attention mechanism and a consistency regularization scheme to filter noise introduced by missing values, avoiding data imputation.

Result: Experiments on four real-world datasets highlight strong performance of CRIB, showing accurate predictions even under high missing rates.

Conclusion: CRIB demonstrates that direct prediction from incomplete datasets can outperform traditional approaches by effectively handling signal noise and preserving predictive features.

Abstract: Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time
series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of
research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing
data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework
that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting
on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there
is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process
susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct
supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade
prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves
away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time
series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a
novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a
unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to
learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values
while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts
accurately even under high missing rates. Our code is available in

*Xiangqi Wang,Yue Huang,Yujun Zhou,Xiaonan Luo,Kehan Guo,Xiangliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an approach called CE-PO to improve language model reasoning by enhancing causal coherence, yielding both accuracy and robustness improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models often produce superficially correct answers by exploiting spurious reasoning, leading to degraded performance under small causal perturbations.

Method: The CE-PO framework shapes reinforcement learning rewards by using Jacobian-based causal sensitivity estimates, suppressing spurious cues, and combining causal coherence and accuracy scores with a tunable parameter. It integrates smoothly into standard policy optimization frameworks like PPO/GRPO.

Result: CE-PO enhances reasoning benchmarks, reducing reward hacking and unfaithful reasoning. It improves model accuracy by an average of 5.49% (up to 9.58%) across four datasets and boosts robustness against causal flips and counterfactual edits.

Conclusion: CE-PO represents an effective approach to improving the faithfulness, robustness, and overall performance of reasoning in language models without architectural modifications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement objectives often
achieve superficially correct answers via shortcut strategies, pairing correct
outputs with spurious or unfaithful reasoning and degrading under small causal
perturbations. We introduce Causally-Enhanced Policy Optimization (CE-PO), a
drop-in reward-shaping framework that augments policy optimization with a
differentiable proxy for causal coherence along the generation pathway from
prompt (Z) to rationale (X) to answer (Y). CE-PO estimates model-internal
influence with Jacobian-based sensitivities, counterfactually hardens these
signals to suppress nuisance cues, and fuses the resulting coherence score with
task-accuracy feedback via a Minkowski (power-mean) combiner, exposing a single
tunable between accuracy and coherence trade-off. The unified reward integrates
with PPO/GRPO without architectural changes. Across reasoning benchmarks and
causal stress tests, CE-PO reduces reward hacking and unfaithful
chain-of-thought while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and
light counterfactual edits, all at near-parity accuracy. Experimental results
across 4 datasets show that CE-PO improves accuracy over baselines by 5.49% on
average (up to 9.58%), while improving robustness to correlation-causation
flips and light counterfactual edits.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the instability and slow convergence issues in extending discrete-time RL algorithms to continuous-time environments by introducing CT-DDPG, a deterministic policy gradient method with enhanced stability and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world RL applications are often continuous and complex, requiring algorithms that perform well in continuous-time settings without sensitivity to time discretization.

Method: The authors derive a continuous-time policy gradient formula based on an advantage function analogue and introduce CT-DDPG, an algorithm enabling stable learning in continuous-time environments.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate that CT-DDPG improves stability and convergence across diverse control tasks with varying time discretizations and noise levels.

Conclusion: CT-DDPG provides a strong theoretical foundation and practical performance benefits, addressing key challenges in continuous-time RL applications.

Abstract: The theory of discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL) has advanced rapidly
over the past decades. Although primarily designed for discrete environments,
many real-world RL applications are inherently continuous and complex. A major
challenge in extending discrete-time algorithms to continuous-time settings is
their sensitivity to time discretization, often leading to poor stability and
slow convergence. In this paper, we investigate deterministic policy gradient
methods for continuous-time RL. We derive a continuous-time policy gradient
formula based on an analogue of the advantage function and establish its
martingale characterization. This theoretical foundation leads to our proposed
algorithm, CT-DDPG, which enables stable learning with deterministic policies
in continuous-time environments. Numerical experiments show that the proposed
CT-DDPG algorithm offers improved stability and faster convergence compared to
existing discrete-time and continuous-time methods, across a wide range of
control tasks with varying time discretizations and noise levels.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an 8-bit variant of the Muon optimizer, showing competitive results compared to AdamW and 8-bit AdamW, while reducing memory footprint by ~74%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce memory overhead in modern deep learning optimizers, enhance computational efficiency, and maintain stability under quantization.

Method: Developed an 8-bit Muon optimizer utilizing blockwise quantization with support for both linear and dynamic schemes, coupled with experiments and theoretical perspective.

Result: 8-bit Muon achieves ~74% memory reduction compared to full-precision Muon, closely matches Muon’s performance, and outperforms AdamW and 8-bit AdamW in LLM pretraining and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The 8-bit Muon provides a significant memory footprint reduction without sacrificing performance or stability, offering promising advancements in computational efficiency for LLMs.

Abstract: The Muon optimizer, based on matrix orthogonalization, has recently shown
faster convergence and up to 2x computational efficiency over AdamW in LLM
pretraining. Like AdamW, Muon is stateful, requiring storage of both model
weights and accumulated gradients. While 8-bit AdamW variants mitigate this
overhead using blockwise quantization, they are typically stable only under
dynamic quantization - which improves stability on linear quantization for
extreme values. In this paper, we introduce the 8-bit Muon optimizer using
blockwise quantization, supporting both linear and dynamic schemes. We
demonstrate that 8-bit Muon maintains stability under both, while delivering
$\sim$74\% reduction in memory footprint compared to full-precision Muon. In
extensive experiments, 8-bit Muon closely matches the performance of Muon while
outperforming AdamW and 8-bit AdamW in pre-training a 1.6B model on 4B FineWeb
tokens. It also shows competitive results when fine-tuning the Llama 3.2 3B
model on post-training data. We also provide a theoretical perspective to help
explain this robustness under quantization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FraudTransformer, a sequence modeling approach tailored for detecting payment fraud by incorporating temporal and positional encoding. It surpasses traditional and ablation baselines in predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting payment fraud in banking streams, where the order of events and variable time gaps are critical.

Method: FraudTransformer is based on a GPT-style architecture and introduces time encoders (absolute or inter-event) and learned positional encoders, enhancing its ability to model event sequences effectively.

Result: Experimental tests on a large dataset confirm FraudTransformer's superiority over classical machine learning approaches (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM) and incomplete models in AUROC and PRAUC metrics.

Conclusion: FraudTransformer is an advanced sequence model that successfully captures time and order features, making it highly effective for fraud detection in banking environments.

Abstract: Detecting payment fraud in real-world banking streams requires models that
can exploit both the order of events and the irregular time gaps between them.
We introduce FraudTransformer, a sequence model that augments a vanilla
GPT-style architecture with (i) a dedicated time encoder that embeds either
absolute timestamps or inter-event values, and (ii) a learned positional
encoder that preserves relative order. Experiments on a large industrial
dataset -- tens of millions of transactions and auxiliary events -- show that
FraudTransformer surpasses four strong classical baselines (Logistic
Regression, XGBoost and LightGBM) as well as transformer ablations that omit
either the time or positional component. On the held-out test set it delivers
the highest AUROC and PRAUC.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RHYTHM, a framework using large language models for enhanced human mobility prediction by addressing complex temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human mobility prediction is challenging due to its inherent long-range dependencies and periodic behaviors.

Method: RHYTHM uses temporal tokenization to encode human trajectories into segments with hierarchical attention for capturing dependencies, enriches these tokens with pre-computed embeddings from a frozen LLM, and reduces computational complexity by freezing the LLM backbone.

Result: The model demonstrated a 2.4% accuracy improvement overall, 5.0% accuracy increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time on three real-world datasets.

Conclusion: RHYTHM shows promise in using LLMs for efficient and accurate spatio-temporal trajectory prediction and provides its code for further research.

Abstract: Predicting human mobility is inherently challenging due to complex long-range
dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors. To address this, we introduce
RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility),
a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as
general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners.
Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each
trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with
hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies,
thereby significantly reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical
information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding
pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets
via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM
backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM freezes
the pretrained LLM's backbone to reduce attention complexity and memory cost.
We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world
datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a
5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time. Code is

TL;DR: This paper addresses the brittleness in large language models' deterministic routing mechanism by proposing a Bayesian framework for improved uncertainty modeling, leading to better calibration and detection of out-of-distribution inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of deterministic routing in Mixture-of-Experts architectures, which cause model miscalibration, overconfidence, and inability to recognize uncertainty.

Method: Proposing a Bayesian routing framework for MoE models that introduces principled uncertainty in routing decisions across three stages: weight-space, logit-space, and selection-space.

Result: Controlled experiments on a 3-billion parameter MoE model show improved routing stability, better calibration for in-distribution data, and enhanced detection of out-of-distribution inputs.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian framework improves the reliability of uncertainty signals and offers a computationally feasible approach towards making large language models more robust and self-aware.

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has enabled the creation of massive
yet efficient Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the standard deterministic
routing mechanism presents a significant limitation: its inherent brittleness
is a key contributor to model miscalibration and overconfidence, resulting in
systems that often do not know what they don't know.
  This thesis confronts this challenge by proposing a structured
\textbf{Bayesian MoE routing framework}. Instead of forcing a single,
deterministic expert selection, our approach models a probability distribution
over the routing decision itself. We systematically investigate three families
of methods that introduce this principled uncertainty at different stages of
the routing pipeline: in the \textbf{weight-space}, the \textbf{logit-space},
and the final \textbf{selection-space}.
  Through a series of controlled experiments on a 3-billion parameter MoE
model, we demonstrate that this framework significantly improves routing
stability, in-distribution calibration, and out-of-distribution (OoD)
detection. The results show that by targeting this core architectural
component, we can create a more reliable internal uncertainty signal. This work
provides a practical and computationally tractable pathway towards building
more robust and self-aware LLMs, taking a crucial step towards making them know
what they don't know.

Motivation: Missing values in tabular data are particularly problematic in fields like healthcare, especially for longitudinal data, where existing imputation methods are either restrictive or inefficient.

Method: The approach uses a mask-aware conditional flow matching framework that focuses on missing entries while preserving observed values, with mechanisms like stability penalties, consistency regularization, and time-decayed noise injection.

Result: The Impute-MACFM framework delivers superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art imputation results across diverse benchmarks while ensuring efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: Impute-MACFM establishes flow matching as a promising method for handling missing data in tabular and longitudinal datasets.

Abstract: Tabular data are central to many applications, especially longitudinal data
in healthcare, where missing values are common, undermining model fidelity and
reliability. Prior imputation methods either impose restrictive assumptions or
struggle with complex cross-feature structure, while recent generative
approaches suffer from instability and costly inference. We propose
Impute-MACFM, a mask-aware conditional flow matching framework for tabular
imputation that addresses missingness mechanisms, missing completely at random,
missing at random, and missing not at random. Its mask-aware objective builds
trajectories only on missing entries while constraining predicted velocity to
remain near zero on observed entries, using flexible nonlinear schedules.
Impute-MACFM combines: (i) stability penalties on observed positions, (ii)
consistency regularization enforcing local invariance, and (iii) time-decayed
noise injection for numeric features. Inference uses constraint-preserving
ordinary differential equation integration with per-step projection to fix
observed values, optionally aggregating multiple trajectories for robustness.
Across diverse benchmarks, Impute-MACFM achieves state-of-the-art results while
delivering more robust, efficient, and higher-quality imputation than competing
approaches, establishing flow matching as a promising direction for tabular
missing-data problems, including longitudinal data.

### [785] [Differentiable Sparsity via $D$-Gating: Simple and Versatile Structured Penalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23898)
*Chris Kolb,Laetitia Frost,Bernd Bischl,David Rügamer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces $D$-Gating, a fully differentiable approach for structured sparsity in compact neural networks, offering theoretical equivalence to group sparsity without requiring non-standard optimizers or post-hoc pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structured sparsity is crucial for compacting neural networks, but existing methods struggle with non-differentiability issues, needing specialized optimizers or post-hoc pruning.

Method: The authors propose $D$-Gating, an overparameterization technique splitting weights into a primary vector and scalar gating factors, enabling differentiability and providing theoretical guarantees of equivalence with group sparsity penalties.

Result: Experiments show $D$-Gating achieves effective performance-sparsity tradeoffs across various tasks, surpassing structured penalty optimization and pruning baselines.

Conclusion: $D$-Gating offers a principled, scalable solution for structured sparsity, improving compact neural network training while maintaining strong theoretical guarantees and practical performance.

Abstract: Structured sparsity regularization offers a principled way to compact neural
networks, but its non-differentiability breaks compatibility with conventional
stochastic gradient descent and requires either specialized optimizers or
additional post-hoc pruning without formal guarantees. In this work, we propose
$D$-Gating, a fully differentiable structured overparameterization that splits
each group of weights into a primary weight vector and multiple scalar gating
factors. We prove that any local minimum under $D$-Gating is also a local
minimum using non-smooth structured $L_{2,2/D}$ penalization, and further show
that the $D$-Gating objective converges at least exponentially fast to the
$L_{2,2/D}$-regularized loss in the gradient flow limit. Together, our results
show that $D$-Gating is theoretically equivalent to solving the original group
sparsity problem, yet induces distinct learning dynamics that evolve from a
non-sparse regime into sparse optimization. We validate our theory across
vision, language, and tabular tasks, where $D$-Gating consistently delivers
strong performance-sparsity tradeoffs and outperforms both direct optimization
of structured penalties and conventional pruning baselines.

*Haotian Liu,Shuo Wang,Hongteng Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a confidence-calibrated group sequence policy gradient method (C$^2$GSPG) to address overconfidence issues in reinforcement learning-based reasoning models, achieving better reasoning accuracy and confidence calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the overconfidence issue in reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to develop self-aware reasoning models.

Method: The study introduces the C$^2$GSPG framework, leveraging sequence-level probability and implementing a cross-entropy confidence calibration regularizer with binary and non-binary reward mechanisms.

Result: C$^2$GSPG significantly improves reasoning accuracy and confidence calibration when applied to logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: C$^2$GSPG provides a robust solution for both improving reasoning performance and achieving better model confidence calibration in reinforcement learning-based reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, play a central role in developing
reasoning models. However, these methods often suffer from a critical
overconfidence issue, which prevents them from achieving self-aware reasoning
models. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective confidence-calibration
group sequence policy gradient method, called C$^2$GSPG, which simultaneously
enhances reasoning performance while suppressing overconfidence. In principle,
we propose a Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG) framework for learning
reasoning models, which eliminates the token-level bias commonly appearing in
GRPO and its variants. In this framework, we define the model confidence for
each reasoning problem using the normalized sequence-level probability, and
then apply a cross-entropy regularizer to calibrate the model confidence to the
sequence's reward. We demonstrate that the confidence calibration regularizer
and GSPG are collaborative for binary rewards, as their objectives always share
the same gradient direction. For non-binary rewards, we apply nonlinear reward
normalization and adaptive regularizer clipping, mitigating the potential
conflict between the two objectives. Applying C$^2$GSPG to post-train large
language models in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, we show its
superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both reasoning accuracy and
confidence calibration. The code of C$^2$GSPG is available at

*Yang Chen,Menglin Zou,Jiaqi Zhang,Yitan Zhang,Junyi Yang,Gael Gendron,Libo Zhang,Jiamou Liu,Michael J. Witbrock*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Trust Region Reward Optimization (TRRO), aiming for stable and guaranteed improvements in Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), achieving competitive results on benchmarks and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern IRL methods often face instability due to alternating reward and policy optimization in adversarial methods, while the non-adversarial approaches providing stability lack formal guarantees.

Method: The paper introduces TRRO that employs a Minorization-Maximization process for monotonic improvement in reward optimization and instantiates it into a practical algorithm called PIRO.

Result: PIRO demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in reward recovery, policy imitation, and sample efficiency across synthetic benchmarks (MuJoCo, Gym-Robotics) and real-world tasks like animal behavior modeling.

Conclusion: TRRO brings theoretical stability guarantees similar to Trust Region Policy Optimization in forward RL to IRL, providing a stable and practical alternative for learning reward functions.

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) learns a reward function to explain
expert demonstrations. Modern IRL methods often use the adversarial (minimax)
formulation that alternates between reward and policy optimization, which often
lead to unstable training. Recent non-adversarial IRL approaches improve
stability by jointly learning reward and policy via energy-based formulations
but lack formal guarantees. This work bridges this gap. We first present a
unified view showing canonical non-adversarial methods explicitly or implicitly
maximize the likelihood of expert behavior, which is equivalent to minimizing
the expected return gap. This insight leads to our main contribution: Trust
Region Reward Optimization (TRRO), a framework that guarantees monotonic
improvement in this likelihood via a Minorization-Maximization process. We
instantiate TRRO into Proximal Inverse Reward Optimization (PIRO), a practical
and stable IRL algorithm. Theoretically, TRRO provides the IRL counterpart to
the stability guarantees of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) in forward
RL. Empirically, PIRO matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in reward
recovery, policy imitation with high sample efficiency on MuJoCo and
Gym-Robotics benchmarks and a real-world animal behavior modeling task.

*Kaisen Yang,Lixuan He,Rushi Shah,Kaicheng Yang,Qinwei Ma,Dianbo Liu,Alex Lamb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$) framework, improving reasoning in LLMs by separating planning and execution, achieving higher accuracy with enhanced efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches conflate strategic planning with step-by-step execution, leading to inefficiency and limited reasoning pathway exploration.

Method: $E^2C$ employs a two-phase reasoning framework with distinct exploratory and execution stages, supported by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for training.

Result: On AIME'2024, $E^2C$ reduces computational token usage while maintaining high accuracy. It also demonstrates superior cross-domain adaptability and state-of-the-art performance on medical benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework decouples planning from execution, achieving computational efficiency, improved accuracy, and enhanced interpretability, showcasing its versatility across domains.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants have markedly advanced the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their monolithic and
auto-regressive architecture inherently conflates high-level strategic planning
with low-level step-by-step execution, leading to computational inefficiency,
limited exploration of reasoning paths, and reduced interpretability. To
overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a
structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct
phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level
plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the
chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation
algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement
Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and
reinforces the determinism of execution.This decomposition enables an efficient
test-time scaling strategy: on AIME'2024, $E^2C$ Test Time Scaling reaches
58.1% accuracy using <10% of the decoding tokens required by comparable methods
(e.g., Forest-of-Thought), sharply cutting self-consistency overhead. For
cross-domain adaptation, our Exploration-Focused SFT (EF-SFT) fine-tunes with
only 3.5% of the tokens used by standard SFT yet yields up to 14.5% higher
accuracy than standard SFT on medical benchmarks, delivering state-of-the-art
performance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating
planning from execution. The code and pre-trained models for the project are
available at: https://github.com/yks23/Explore-Execute-Chain.git

*Sipeng Chen,Yan Zhang,Shibo Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces OptiINR, a unified optimization framework for configuring Implicit Neural Representations (INRs), addressing limitations of current heuristic-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inconsistencies and inefficiencies in manually tuning INR configurations by introducing a systematic optimization strategy.

Method: The framework uses Bayesian optimization to explore discrete activation families and continuous initialization parameters for globally optimal INR configurations.

Result: OptiINR consistently delivers globally optimal configurations across various signal processing applications.

Conclusion: This work lays a principled foundation for INR design and substantially improves performance and reliability across diverse use cases.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a transformative
paradigm in signal processing and computer vision, excelling in tasks from
image reconstruction to 3D shape modeling. Yet their effectiveness is
fundamentally limited by the absence of principled strategies for optimal
configuration - spanning activation selection, initialization scales,
layer-wise adaptation, and their intricate interdependencies. These choices
dictate performance, stability, and generalization, but current practice relies
on ad-hoc heuristics, brute-force grid searches, or task-specific tuning, often
leading to inconsistent results across modalities. This work introduces
OptiINR, the first unified framework that formulates INR configuration as a
rigorous optimization problem. Leveraging Bayesian optimization, OptiINR
efficiently explores the joint space of discrete activation families - such as
sinusoidal (SIREN), wavelet-based (WIRE), and variable-periodic (FINER) - and
their associated continuous initialization parameters. This systematic approach
replaces fragmented manual tuning with a coherent, data-driven optimization
process. By delivering globally optimal configurations, OptiINR establishes a
principled foundation for INR design, consistently maximizing performance
across diverse signal processing applications.

### [790] [Does Weak-to-strong Generalization Happen under Spurious Correlations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24005)
*Chenruo Liu,Yijun Dong,Qi Lei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization during fine-tuning of pre-trained models on tasks with spurious correlations due to group imbalance, proposes an analytical framework, and provides an algorithmic improvement to enhance W2S performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the challenge of understanding and improving weak-to-strong generalization when spurious correlations and group imbalances arise during fine-tuning on downstream tasks.

Method: The paper provides a theoretical analysis of W2S gain using proportional asymptotic limit and examines conditions where W2S succeeds or fails based on group imbalance. An algorithmic improvement is proposed by retraining the student on high-confidence data, avoiding reliance on group labels.

Result: Theoretical analyses demonstrate that W2S can fail depending on the mismatch between labeled and unlabeled group imbalances, and this is validated through experimental benchmarks. The proposed algorithm significantly boosts W2S performance.

Conclusion: The findings offer a precise characterization of the conditions impacting W2S generalization and propose a practical, label-free solution that consistently enhances W2S fine-tuning in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: We initiate a unified theoretical and algorithmic study of a key problem in
weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization: when fine-tuning a strong pre-trained
student with pseudolabels from a weaker teacher on a downstream task with
spurious correlations, does W2S happen, and how to improve it upon failures? We
consider two sources of spurious correlations caused by group imbalance: (i) a
weak teacher fine-tuned on group-imbalanced labeled data with a minority group
of fraction $\eta_\ell$, and (ii) a group-imbalanced unlabeled set
pseudolabeled by the teacher with a minority group of fraction $\eta_u$.
Theoretically, a precise characterization of W2S gain at the proportional
asymptotic limit shows that W2S always happens with sufficient pseudolabels
when $\eta_u = \eta_\ell$ but may fail when $\eta_u \ne \eta_\ell$, where W2S
gain diminishes as $(\eta_u - \eta_\ell)^2$ increases. Our theory is
corroborated by extensive experiments on various spurious correlation
benchmarks and teacher-student pairs. To boost W2S performance upon failures,
we further propose a simple, effective algorithmic remedy that retrains the
strong student on its high-confidence data subset after W2S fine-tuning. Our
algorithm is group-label-free and achieves consistent, substantial improvements
over vanilla W2S fine-tuning.

### [791] [TimeExpert: Boosting Long Time Series Forecasting with Temporal Mix of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23145)
*Xiaowen Ma,Shuning Ge,Fan Yang,Xiangyu Li,Yun Chen,Mengting Ma,Wei Zhang,Zhipeng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE), a new mechanism for addressing challenges in Transformer-based time-series forecasting, enhancing prediction accuracy by dynamically adapting to data-specific contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Transformer-based methods for time-series modeling overlook the effects of lagging relevance of timestamps and the influence of noisy, anomalous segments, resulting in suboptimal forecasting accuracy.

Method: The TMOE mechanism redefines attention key-value pairs as local experts for specialized temporal contexts, incorporates query-specific expert selection, and includes a shared global expert for maintaining long-range dependency modeling. It integrates seamlessly into frameworks like PatchTST and Timer without structural changes.

Result: TimeExpert and TimeExpert-G, based on TMOE, achieve superior results in forecasting accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in experiments conducted on seven real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: By addressing real-world challenges through adaptive context aggregation, TMOE enhances forecasting in time-series Transformers while maintaining ease of integration with existing models.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures dominate time series modeling by enabling
global attention over all timestamps, yet their rigid 'one-size-fits-all'
context aggregation fails to address two critical challenges in real-world
data: (1) inherent lag effects, where the relevance of historical timestamps to
a query varies dynamically; (2) anomalous segments, which introduce noisy
signals that degrade forecasting accuracy. To resolve these problems, we
propose the Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE), a novel attention-level mechanism
that reimagines key-value (K-V) pairs as local experts (each specialized in a
distinct temporal context) and performs adaptive expert selection for each
query via localized filtering of irrelevant timestamps. Complementing this
local adaptation, a shared global expert preserves the Transformer's strength
in capturing long-range dependencies. We then replace the vanilla attention
mechanism in popular time-series Transformer frameworks (i.e., PatchTST and
Timer) with TMOE, without extra structural modifications, yielding our specific
version TimeExpert and general version TimeExpert-G. Extensive experiments on
seven real-world long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that TimeExpert
and TimeExpert-G outperform state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) in explainable AI, examining their variability and proposing durability measures based on randomness in CAV computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge in artificial intelligence of improving model transparency and the variability in CAV-based concept explanations due to random sampling of training examples.

Method: Theoretical and experimental analysis of CAVs to quantify and predict their variability. Variance as a function of sample size ($1/N$) is determined through rigorous analysis.

Result: The variance of CAVs decreases proportionally to $1/N$, where $N$ is the number of random training examples. Experimental validation was performed on multiple real-life datasets.

Conclusion: The authors provide theoretical insights and practical recommendations that optimize computational efficiency in the use of CAVs for explainability purposes in AI models.

Abstract: One of the most pressing challenges in artificial intelligence is to make
models more transparent to their users. Recently, explainable artificial
intelligence has come up with numerous method to tackle this challenge. A
promising avenue is to use concept-based explanations, that is, high-level
concepts instead of plain feature importance score. Among this class of
methods, Concept Activation vectors (CAVs), Kim et al. (2018) stands out as one
of the main protagonists. One interesting aspect of CAVs is that their
computation requires sampling random examples in the train set. Therefore, the
actual vectors obtained may vary from user to user depending on the randomness
of this sampling. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained theoretical analysis
of CAVs construction in order to quantify their variability. Our results,
confirmed by experiments on several real-life datasets, point out towards an
universal result: the variance of CAVs decreases as $1/N$, where $N$ is the
number of random examples. Based on this we give practical recommendations for
a resource-efficient application of the method.

*Zhicheng Yang,Zhijiang Guo,Yinya Huang,Yongxin Wang,Yiwei Wang,Xiaodan Liang,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Mirror-Critique, a framework for improving the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through informative critiques during verifier training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the limitations of existing reward model selection methods in identifying minority-yet-correct answers, rendering them less effective than simple majority voting.

Method: The authors propose a framework that uses a small instruction-tuned model to synthesize high-quality critique data through rejection sampling. This data contrasts model-generated solutions with ground truth and trains a verifier to evaluate multiple critiques for solution scoring.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Mirror-Verifier surpasses majority voting in solution accuracy and enhances the solver's honesty in recognizing its capability boundaries.

Conclusion: Mirror-Critique improves solution accuracy and reasoning capabilities of LLMs by training verifiers with detailed critique signals and enabling them to abstain from answers beyond their scope.

Abstract: Test-time scaling via solution sampling and aggregation has become a key
paradigm for improving the reasoning performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs). While reward model selection is commonly employed in this approach, it
often fails to identify minority-yet-correct answers, which limits its
effectiveness beyond that of simple majority voting. We argue that this
limitation stems from a lack of informative critique signals during verifier
training. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mirror-Critique, a framework that
trains a verifier with informative critiques. Our key insight is to leverage
the rich critique signal by contrasting model-generated solutions with
ground-truth solutions. We deploy a small instruction-tuned model to synthesize
high-quality critique data with rejection sampling that teaches the verifier
not only what is wrong, but also why. The synthetic data is used to cold-start
the LLMs in the RLVR process to further improve the verification ability. The
resulting Mirror-Verifier is deployed to evaluate candidate solutions by
generating multiple critiques per solution, aggregating them into a verify
score used for weighted voting or selective abstention. The experimental
results show that our Mirror-Verifier significantly outperforms majority voting
in terms of solution accuracy and also improves the solver's honesty to
recognize and abstain from answering beyond its capability boundaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve self-supervised and contrastive feature learning by leveraging density approximation through Mixture Density Networks.

Method: Combine Mixture Density Networks with four kernelized matrix costs: scalar, vector-matrix, matrix-matrix, and SVD (nuclear norm).

Result: The proposed approach facilitates learning of multiple centers for Gaussian mixture density approximation.

Conclusion: The integration of MDNs with matrix calculus-based costs enhances generative density approximation capabilities.

Abstract: Pairwise distance-based costs are crucial for self-supervised and contrastive
feature learning. Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) are a widely used approach
for generative models and density approximation, using neural networks to
produce multiple centers that define a Gaussian mixture. By combining MDNs with
contrastive costs, this paper proposes data density approximation using four
types of kernelized matrix costs: the scalar cost, the vector-matrix cost, the
matrix-matrix cost (the trace of Schur complement), and the SVD cost (the
nuclear norm), for learning multiple centers required to define a mixture
density.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CrystalGym, an RL environment for crystalline material discovery using DFT-based feedback to optimize properties like band gap, bulk modulus, and density.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of generative models in materials design that don't incorporate direct DFT feedback due to computational costs.

Method: The authors developed CrystalGym, which benchmarks RL algorithms to efficiently design crystals with DFT-calculated properties. They also explore fine-tuning large language models for DFT-based rewards.

Result: While no RL algorithm solves all tasks, the paper demonstrates varied sample efficiencies and convergence behaviors across benchmarks and explores fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: CrystalGym serves as a test bed for studying RL methods in material science, introducing challenges in handling computation-heavy signals for interdisciplinary research.

Abstract: In silico design and optimization of new materials primarily relies on
high-accuracy atomic simulators that perform density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. While recent works showcase the strong potential of machine
learning to accelerate the material design process, they mostly consist of
generative approaches that do not use direct DFT signals as feedback to improve
training and generation mainly due to DFT's high computational cost. To aid the
adoption of direct DFT signals in the materials design loop through online
reinforcement learning (RL), we propose CrystalGym, an open-source RL
environment for crystalline material discovery. Using CrystalGym, we benchmark
common value- and policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms for designing
various crystals conditioned on target properties. Concretely, we optimize for
challenging properties like the band gap, bulk modulus, and density, which are
directly calculated from DFT in the environment. While none of the algorithms
we benchmark solve all CrystalGym tasks, our extensive experiments and
ablations show different sample efficiencies and ease of convergence to
optimality for different algorithms and environment settings. Additionally, we
include a case study on the scope of fine-tuning large language models with
reinforcement learning for improving DFT-based rewards. Our goal is for
CrystalGym to serve as a test bed for reinforcement learning researchers and
material scientists to address these real-world design problems with practical
applications. We therefore introduce a novel class of challenges for
reinforcement learning methods dealing with time-consuming reward signals,
paving the way for future interdisciplinary research for machine learning
motivated by real-world applications.

### [796] [Demographic-Agnostic Fairness without Harm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24077)
*Zhongteng Cai,Mohammad Mahdi Khalili,Xueru Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Demographic-Agnostic Fairness without Harm (DAFH) to achieve fairness in machine learning without relying on individual demographic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns arise with machine learning biases against social groups, especially in parity-based fairness methods that sacrifice accuracy in critical domains like healthcare.

Method: The paper develops a DAFH optimization algorithm that jointly learns group classifiers and decoupled classifiers for demographic-agnostic fairness.

Result: Sample complexity analysis supports the method's superiority when demographic data is available, with experiments validating performance on synthetic and real data.

Conclusion: DAFH represents a step forward in fairness optimization, eliminating the need for explicit demographic information while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in social domains
to make predictions about humans, there is a growing concern that these
algorithms may exhibit biases against certain social groups. Numerous notions
of fairness have been proposed in the literature to measure the unfairness of
ML. Among them, one class that receives the most attention is
\textit{parity-based}, i.e., achieving fairness by equalizing treatment or
outcomes for different social groups. However, achieving parity-based fairness
often comes at the cost of lowering model accuracy and is undesirable for many
high-stakes domains like healthcare. To avoid inferior accuracy, a line of
research focuses on \textit{preference-based} fairness, under which any group
of individuals would experience the highest accuracy and collectively prefer
the ML outcomes assigned to them if they were given the choice between various
sets of outcomes. However, these works assume individual demographic
information is known and fully accessible during training. In this paper, we
relax this requirement and propose a novel \textit{demographic-agnostic
fairness without harm (DAFH)} optimization algorithm, which jointly learns a
group classifier that partitions the population into multiple groups and a set
of decoupled classifiers associated with these groups. Theoretically, we
conduct sample complexity analysis and show that our method can outperform the
baselines when demographic information is known and used to train decoupled
classifiers. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the proposed
method.

TL;DR: The paper proposes enhanced methods for detecting cognitive impairment in older adults using passive smartphone sensing data and LSTM models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited sensitivity of infrequent clinical assessments in detecting subtle cognitive declines in older adults.

Method: Development of an LSTM model using multimodal smartphone sensing data. Improved generalizability through routine-aware augmentation and demographic personalization techniques.

Result: The enhanced techniques increased AUPRC from 0.637 to 0.766, showing improved model performance in detecting cognitive impairment.

Conclusion: Passive smartphone sensing combined with advanced modeling techniques has significant potential for scalable cognitive monitoring in aging populations.

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive impairment is critical for timely diagnosis and
intervention, yet infrequent clinical assessments often lack the sensitivity
and temporal resolution to capture subtle cognitive declines in older adults.
Passive smartphone sensing has emerged as a promising approach for naturalistic
and continuous cognitive monitoring. Building on this potential, we implemented
a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to detect cognitive impairment from
sequences of daily behavioral features, derived from multimodal sensing data
collected in an ongoing one-year study of older adults. Our key contributions
are two techniques to enhance model generalizability across participants: (1)
routine-aware augmentation, which generates synthetic sequences by replacing
each day with behaviorally similar alternatives, and (2) demographic
personalization, which reweights training samples to emphasize those from
individuals demographically similar to the test participant. Evaluated on
6-month data from 36 older adults, these techniques jointly improved the Area
Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of the model trained on sensing and
demographic features from 0.637 to 0.766, highlighting the potential of
scalable monitoring of cognitive impairment in aging populations with passive
sensing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of ill-posedness, data sparsity, and irregular geometries in solving PDE-governed inverse problems.

Method: Developed GeoFunFlow, combining a geometric function autoencoder (GeoFAE) for mesh processing and a diffusion model for posterior sampling.

Result: GeoFunFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks with better reconstruction accuracy and efficient inference, alongside effective uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: GeoFunFlow successfully handles complex geometries in inverse problems, offering scalability, efficiency, and reliable results compared to traditional optimization and existing learning-based methods.

Abstract: Inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are
crucial in science and engineering. They are particularly challenging due to
ill-posedness, data sparsity, and the added complexity of irregular geometries.
Classical PDE-constrained optimization methods are computationally expensive,
especially when repeated posterior sampling is required. Learning-based
approaches improve efficiency and scalability, yet most are designed for
regular domains or focus on forward modeling. Here, we introduce {\em
GeoFunFlow}, a geometric diffusion model framework for inverse problems on
complex geometries. GeoFunFlow combines a novel geometric function autoencoder
(GeoFAE) and a latent diffusion model trained via rectified flow. GeoFAE
employs a Perceiver module to process unstructured meshes of varying sizes and

*Ziheng Peng,Shijie Ren,Xinyue Gu,Linxiao Yang,Xiting Wang,Liang Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoTS is a novel deep learning framework for time series forecasting that combines interpretable decision-making with high accuracy through hierarchical prototypical temporal patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance trust in deep learning models for time series forecasting by making their decision-making process interpretable, particularly in high-stakes scenarios.

Method: Introduces ProtoTS, which computes instance-prototype similarity using denoised representations and organizes prototypes hierarchically to capture both global and local temporal patterns.

Result: ProtoTS outperforms existing models in forecast accuracy and provides multi-level, expert-steerable interpretability that aids in model understanding and decision-making.

Conclusion: ProtoTS establishes a balance between forecast accuracy and transparent interpretations, facilitating better trust and decision support for time series forecasting applications in practical settings.

Abstract: While deep learning has achieved impressive performance in time series
forecasting, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand its decision-making
process for building trust in high-stakes scenarios. Existing interpretable
models often provide only local and partial explanations, lacking the
capability to reveal how heterogeneous and interacting input variables jointly
shape the overall temporal patterns in the forecast curve. We propose ProtoTS,
a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy
and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal
patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised
representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The
prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns
with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with
detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability.
Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF
dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast
accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model
understanding and decision support.

### [800] [A signal separation view of classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24140)
*H. N. Mhaskar,Ryan O'Dowd*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel classification method using localized trigonometric polynomial kernels to achieve perfect classification with minimal labels, particularly for datasets with overlapping class boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current classification methods often rely on function approximation, but they struggle with overlapping class boundaries and determining the number of classes. The authors aim to address these limitations and improve classification accuracy.

Method: The authors propose the MASC algorithm, which uses localized trigonometric polynomial kernels originally designed for signal processing to hierarchically separate class boundaries in compact metric spaces.

Result: The method demonstrated effectiveness on various datasets, including challenging hyperspectral datasets like Salinas and Indian Pines, as well as a document classification dataset.

Conclusion: The MASC approach theoretically ensures perfect classification with minimal queries and successfully separates class boundaries even when overlap exists, providing a promising alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: The problem of classification in machine learning has often been approached
in terms of function approximation. In this paper, we propose an alternative
approach for classification in arbitrary compact metric spaces which, in
theory, yields both the number of classes, and a perfect classification using a
minimal number of queried labels. Our approach uses localized trigonometric
polynomial kernels initially developed for the point source signal separation
problem in signal processing. Rather than point sources, we argue that the
various classes come from different probability distributions. The localized
kernel technique developed for separating point sources is then shown to
separate the supports of these distributions. This is done in a hierarchical
manner in our MASC algorithm to accommodate touching/overlapping class
boundaries. We illustrate our theory on several simulated and real life
datasets, including the Salinas and Indian Pines hyperspectral datasets and a
document dataset.

*Hangwei Zhang,Chun Kang,Yan Wang,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for pre-trained Large Operator Models (LOMs) in scientific machine learning, introducing a novel approach called Frequency-Adaptive Adapter (F-Adapter) that surpasses existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) in scientific machine learning due to its success in other fields like language and vision processing.

Method: Analyzed the performance of PEFT methods, particularly LoRA and Adapter tuning, on LOMs. Developed a theoretical evaluation of their approximation capacities and introduced the Frequency-Adaptive Adapter (F-Adapter), tailoring adapter capacity according to spectral complexity.

Result: F-Adapters achieve state-of-the-art results on complex 3D Navier-Stokes benchmarks, improving generalization and spectral fidelity compared to LoRA and other PEFT methods.

Conclusion: F-Adapter demonstrates the potential of PEFT for scientific machine learning, offering superior performance and establishing a new paradigm in the domain.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of powerful pre-trained models for
complex downstream tasks has proven effective in vision and language
processing, yet this paradigm remains unexplored in scientific machine
learning, where the objective is to model complex physical systems. We conduct
the first systematic study of PEFT for pre-trained Large Operator Models (LOMs)
obtained by scaling variants of Fourier Neural Operator. First, we observe that
the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields markedly poorer performance
on LOMs than Adapter tuning. Then, we further theoretically establish that
stacked LoRA incurs a depth-amplified lower bound on approximation error within
Fourier layers, whereas adapters retain universal approximation capacity and,
by concentrating parameters on energy-dominant low-frequency modes, attain
exponentially decaying error with bottleneck width in the Fourier domain.
Motivated by the robust empirical gains of adapters and by our theoretical
characterization of PDE solutions as spectrally sparse, we introduce
Frequency-Adaptive Adapter (F-Adapter). F-Adapter allocates adapter capacity
based on spectral complexity, assigning higher-dimension modules to
low-frequency components and lower-dimension modules to high-frequency
components. Our F-Adapters establish state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on
multiple challenging 3D Navier-Stokes benchmarks, markedly enhancing both
generalization and spectral fidelity over LoRA and other PEFT techniques
commonly used in LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to
explore PEFT for scientific machine-learning and establishes F-Adapter as an
effective paradigm for this domain.

### [802] [ZeroSiam: An Efficient Siamese for Test-Time Entropy Optimization without Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23183)
*Guohao Chen,Shuaicheng Niu,Deyu Chen,Jiahao Yang,Zitian Zhang,Mingkui Tan,Pengcheng Wu,Zhiqi Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZeroSiam introduces an efficient Siamese architecture for test-time entropy minimization, preventing collapsed solutions and improving model performance over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pure entropy minimization during test-time adaption can lead to non-generalizable shortcuts and collapsed solutions, limiting the model’s learning potential.

Method: The approach uses asymmetric divergence alignment facilitated by a learnable predictor and stop-gradient operator to stabilize test-time adaptation.

Result: ZeroSiam avoids collapses, absorbs biased signals, and enhances model performance across vision adaptation and language reasoning tasks, even for small, collapse-prone models.

Conclusion: ZeroSiam is a stable and effective test-time adaption method, demonstrating robust performance with minimal overhead across diverse scenarios and models.

Abstract: Test-time entropy minimization helps adapt a model to novel environments and
incentivize its reasoning capability, unleashing the model's potential during
inference by allowing it to evolve and improve in real-time using its own
predictions, achieving promising performance. However, pure entropy
minimization can favor non-generalizable shortcuts, such as inflating the logit
norm and driving all predictions to a dominant class to reduce entropy, risking
collapsed solutions (e.g., constant one-hot outputs) that trivially minimize
the objective without meaningful learning. In this paper, we introduce
ZeroSiam, an efficient asymmetric Siamese architecture tailored for test-time
entropy minimization. ZeroSiam prevents collapse through asymmetric divergence
alignment, which is efficiently achieved by a learnable predictor and a
stop-gradient operator before the classifier. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence that ZeroSiam not only prevents collapse solutions, but
also absorbs and regularizes biased learning signals, enhancing performance
even when no collapse occurs. Despite its simplicity, extensive results show
that ZeroSiam performs more stably over prior methods using negligible
overhead, demonstrating efficacy on both vision adaptation and large language
model reasoning tasks across challenging test scenarios and diverse models,
including tiny models that are particularly collapse-prone.

*Jianxin Zhang,Clayton Scott*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to enable precise image editing with pretrained text-to-image generative models while maintaining visual consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of editing images using pretrained text-to-image models without losing fine details or introducing artifacts.

Method: The method employs coupled SDEs to guide the sampling process by leveraging correlated noise between the source and edited images, ensuring semantic changes while retaining visual similarity.

Result: The proposed approach delivers high prompt fidelity and near-pixel-level consistency without requiring retraining or auxiliary networks.

Conclusion: Coupled SDEs provide an effective, straightforward tool for controlled generative AI that balances semantic transformation with image consistency.

Abstract: Editing the content of an image with a pretrained text-to-image model remains
challenging. Existing methods often distort fine details or introduce
unintended artifacts. We propose using coupled stochastic differential
equations (coupled SDEs) to guide the sampling process of any pre-trained
generative model that can be sampled by solving an SDE, including diffusion and
rectified flow models. By driving both the source image and the edited image
with the same correlated noise, our approach steers new samples toward the
desired semantics while preserving visual similarity to the source. The method
works out-of-the-box-without retraining or auxiliary networks-and achieves high
prompt fidelity along with near-pixel-level consistency. These results position
coupled SDEs as a simple yet powerful tool for controlled generative AI.

*Zhanhong Xie,Meifan Zhang,Lihua Yin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoSIFL is a novel framework for federated learning that integrates security alarms, local differential privacy, and an incentive scheme to enhance model robustness and client data contribution under privacy constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in federated learning from malicious or compromised clients and the lack of incentives for high-quality data contribution while ensuring strict privacy compliance.

Method: CoSIFL incorporates active alarming mechanisms, robust aggregation for security, a Tullock contest-inspired incentive module, and a game-theoretic approach to optimize server-client interactions in federated learning.

Result: The proposed framework achieves improved model robustness, lowers server costs, and adapts to client attributes like non-IID degrees and privacy budgets on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoSIFL effectively tackles challenges in federated learning with an integrated design, balancing security, privacy, and incentivization for efficient and robust model training.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative
model training while preserving data locality. However, it still faces
challenges from malicious or compromised clients, as well as difficulties in
incentivizing participants to contribute high-quality data under strict privacy
requirements. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CoSIFL, a novel
framework that integrates proactive alarming for robust security and local
differential privacy (LDP) for inference attacks, together with a
Stackelberg-based incentive scheme to encourage client participation and data
sharing. Specifically, CoSIFL uses an active alarming mechanism and robust
aggregation to defend against Byzantine and inference attacks, while a Tullock
contest-inspired incentive module rewards honest clients for both data
contributions and reliable alarm triggers. We formulate the interplay between
the server and clients as a two-stage game: in the first stage, the server
determines total rewards, selects participants, and fixes global iteration
settings, whereas in the second stage, each client decides its mini-batch size,
privacy noise scale, and alerting strategy. We prove that the server-client
game admits a unique equilibrium, and analyze how clients' multi-dimensional
attributes - such as non-IID degrees and privacy budgets - jointly affect
system efficiency. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that
CoSIFL outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in improving model robustness and
reducing total server costs, highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated
design.

### [805] [AuON: A Linear-time Alternative to Semi-Orthogonal Momentum Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24320)
*Dipan Maity*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introducing AuON, a linear-time optimizer that simplifies momentum-based updates for machine learning, bypassing traditional orthogonalization methods and quadratic costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Momentum-based updates with orthogonal properties have potential in machine learning optimization but face computational bottlenecks due to quadratic costs.

Method: AuON utilizes hyperbolic-cosine RMS scaling transformations combined with normalization, avoiding explicit semi-orthogonalization.

Result: AuON and its hybrid variant deliver performance comparable to strong baselines like AdamW while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: AuON offers an effective and efficient alternative for machine learning optimization, overcoming limitations of earlier methods like Newton-Schulz iterations.

Abstract: Orthogonal gradient updates have emerged as a promising direction in
optimization for machine learning. However, traditional approaches such as
SVD/QR decomposition incur prohibitive computational costs of O(n^3) and
underperform compared to well-tuned SGD with momentum, since momentum is
applied only after strict orthogonalization. Recent advances, such as Muon,
improve efficiency by applying momentum before orthogonalization and producing
semi-orthogonal matrices via Newton-Schulz iterations, reducing complexity to
O(n^2). Nevertheless, quadratic costs remain a bottleneck.
  In this work, we study the semi-orthogonal properties of momentum-based
updates and develop a method to bound momentum updates under a spectral-norm
trust region, preserving directional information without requiring explicit
semi-orthogonalization.
  We propose AuON (Alternative Unit-norm momentum updates by Normalized
nonlinear scaling), a linear-time optimizer that achieves strong performance
without constructing semi-orthogonal matrices, while preserving structural
alignment and reconditioning ill-posed updates. Our approach combines
hyperbolic-cosine RMS scaling transformations with normalization, demonstrating
both effectiveness and computational efficiency compared to Newton-Schulz
methods. We further introduce a hybrid variant (Hybrid-AuON) that applies a
single Newton-Schulz iteration. Experiments across vision and language
benchmarks show that AuON and its hybrid variant achieve performance comparable
to strong baselines such as AdamW and Muon.

### [806] [Bridging the Gap Between Promise and Performance for Microscaling FP4 Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23202)
*Vage Egiazarian,Roberto L. Castro,Denis Kuznedelev,Andrei Panferov,Eldar Kurtic,Shubhra Pandit,Alexandre Marques,Mark Kurtz,Saleh Ashkboos,Torsten Hoefler,Dan Alistarh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies two 4-bit floating-point formats (MXFP4 and NVFP4) for LLM inference and introduces a new quantization algorithm (MR-GPTQ) to overcome their limitations, achieving significant speedups and accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and address the practical limitations of hardware-accelerated 4-bit floating-point formats for post-training quantization in LLM inference.

Method: Introduced MR-GPTQ, a quantization algorithm tailored to FP4's properties using block-wise Hadamard transforms and format-specific optimizations. High-performance GPU kernels were developed for MR-GPTQ.

Result: Achieved up to 3.6x layer-wise and 2.2x end-to-end speedups on NVIDIA B200, and 6x layer-wise and 4x end-to-end speedups on RTX5090. Demonstrated that MR-GPTQ matches or outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly enhancing MXFP4's performance.

Conclusion: FP4 formats have limitations, particularly NVFP4's group size and MXFP4's scaling, but specialized methods like MR-GPTQ can enable better accuracy and performance trade-offs, making FP4 practical for certain applications.

Abstract: The recent hardware-accelerated microscaling 4-bit floating-point formats
such as MXFP4 and NVFP4, supported on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, promise to
revolutionize large language model (LLM) inference. Yet, their practical
benefits remain unproven. We present the first comprehensive study of MXFP4 and
NVFP4 for post-training quantization, revealing gaps between their promise and
real-world performance. Our analysis shows that state-of-the-art methods
struggle with FP4, due to two key issues: (1) NVFP4's small group size provably
neutralizes traditional outlier mitigation techniques; (2) MXFP4's power-of-two
scale quantization severely degrades accuracy due to high induced error. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ), a variant of the
classic GPTQ quantization algorithm that tailors the quantization process to
FP4's unique properties, by using block-wise Hadamard transforms and
format-specific optimizations. We support our proposal with a set of
high-performance GPU kernels that enable the MR-GPTQ format with negligible
overhead, by rotation fusion into the weights, and fast online computation of
the activations. This leads to speedups vs. FP16 of up to 3.6x layer-wise, and
2.2x end-to-end on NVIDIA B200, and of 6x layer-wise and 4x end-to-end on
RTX5090. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that MR-GPTQ matches
or outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly boosting MXFP4, to the
point where it nears that of NVFP4. We conclude that, while FP4 is not an
automatic upgrade over INT4, format-specialized methods like MR-GPTQ can unlock
a new frontier of accuracy-performance trade-offs.

*Wenhao Zhang,Shao Zhang,Xihuai Wang,Yang Li,Ying Wen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of performance degradation in In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) caused by Contextual Ambiguity, introducing Context Value as a solution to improve testing phase outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the problem of performance degradation during testing in ICRL due to Contextual Ambiguity, where models produce sub-optimal interactions resembling flawed policies.

Method: The authors propose Context Value-Informed In-Context RL (CV-ICRL), leveraging Context Value as a theoretical signal about achievable ideal performance, coupled with methods to estimate it during training and testing.

Result: Experiments on the Dark Room and Minigrid testbeds show improved performance and mitigation of testing phase degradation using CV-ICRL.

Conclusion: CV-ICRL enhances ICRL's robustness and adaptability to tasks, resolving Contextual Ambiguity and supporting monotonic policy improvement across diverse environments.

Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for developing agents that can rapidly adapt to new tasks by leveraging past
experiences as context, without updating their parameters. Recent approaches
train large sequence models on monotonic policy improvement data from online
RL, aiming to a continue improved testing time performance. However, our
experimental analysis reveals a critical flaw: these models cannot show a
continue improvement like the training data during testing time. Theoretically,
we identify this phenomenon as Contextual Ambiguity, where the model's own
stochastic actions can generate an interaction history that misleadingly
resembles that of a sub-optimal policy from the training data, initiating a
vicious cycle of poor action selection. To resolve the Contextual Ambiguity, we
introduce Context Value into training phase and propose Context Value Informed
ICRL (CV-ICRL). CV-ICRL use Context Value as an explicit signal representing
the ideal performance theoretically achievable by a policy given the current
context. As the context expands, Context Value could include more task-relevant
information, and therefore the ideal performance should be non-decreasing. We
prove that the Context Value tightens the lower bound on the performance gap
relative to an ideal, monotonically improving policy. We fruther propose two
methods for estimating Context Value at both training and testing time.
Experiments conducted on the Dark Room and Minigrid testbeds demonstrate that
CV-ICRL effectively mitigates performance degradation and improves overall ICRL
abilities across various tasks and environments. The source code and data of
this paper are available at

TL;DR: The paper presents KREPES, a scalable solution for kernel-based representation learning using Nyström approximation, addressing scalability issues and providing interpretability in learned representations compared to deep models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalable representation learning in non-linear, non-parametric methods like kernel techniques has been absent, especially in the era of foundation models with large-scale unlabeled data.

Method: KREPES leverages Nyström approximation to enable scalable kernel-based representation learning, supporting a variety of unsupervised and self-supervised loss functions.

Result: KREPES demonstrates efficiency in processing large datasets (image and tabular) and provides interpretability in learned representations compared to deep learning models.

Conclusion: KREPES establishes a scalable framework for kernel-based representation learning, addressing computational concerns and outperforming deep models in interpretability.

Abstract: Kernel methods provide a theoretically grounded framework for non-linear and
non-parametric learning, with strong analytic foundations and statistical
guarantees. Yet, their scalability has long been limited by prohibitive time
and memory costs. While progress has been made in scaling kernel regression, no
framework exists for scalable kernel-based representation learning, restricting
their use in the era of foundation models where representations are learned
from massive unlabeled data. We introduce KREPES -- a unified, scalable
framework for kernel-based representation learning via Nystr\"om approximation.
KREPES accommodates a wide range of unsupervised and self-supervised losses,
and experiments on large image and tabular datasets demonstrate its efficiency.
Crucially, KREPES enables principled interpretability of the learned
representations, an immediate benefit over deep models, which we substantiate
through dedicated analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to understand causality in large, sparse event sequences for applications in critical domains like healthcare and automotive diagnostics, where existing methods don't scale well.

Method: The paper introduces OSCAR, which uses pre-trained Transformers as density estimators to identify per-sequence Markov Boundaries without global conditional independence testing.

Result: OSCAR successfully recovers interpretable causal structures on a large automotive dataset with 29,100 events and 474 labels within minutes, surpassing classical methods that cannot scale.

Conclusion: OSCAR represents a scalable and practical approach to causal discovery, making it suitable for scientific diagnostics at production scale.

Abstract: Understanding causality in event sequences with thousands of sparse event
types is critical in domains such as healthcare, cybersecurity, or vehicle
diagnostics, yet current methods fail to scale. We present OSCAR, a one-shot
causal autoregressive method that infers per-sequence Markov Boundaries using
two pretrained Transformers as density estimators. This enables efficient,

automotive dataset with 29,100 events and 474 labels, OSCAR recovers
interpretable causal structures in minutes, while classical methods fail to

TL;DR: WirelessMathLM employs domain-specific reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards to enable smaller models (0.5B-7B parameters) to perform specialized wireless mathematics tasks with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to bridge the gap in technical mathematical reasoning for large language models in specialized domains like wireless communications.

Method: Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with binary verification rewards, models are trained directly from base checkpoints without supervised warm-start.

Result: The 7B model achieves 39.5% accuracy on WirelessMathBench-XL, approaching GPT-4o (40.4%) and outperforming much larger models in terms of efficiency.

Conclusion: Domain-specific reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards significantly boosts smaller model performance on specialized tasks while positively transferring to other general mathematical benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general mathematical reasoning but fail
catastrophically on specialized technical mathematics. In wireless
communications, where problems require precise manipulation of
information-theoretic bounds, optimization constraints, and signal processing
formulations, even state-of-the-art models struggle to achieve competent
performance. We present WirelessMathLM, demonstrating that compact models
(0.5B-7B parameters) can match or exceed much larger models through
domain-specific reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Our key insight
is that wireless mathematics problems possess a unique property--verifiable
correctness--that enables effective reinforcement learning without human
feedback. We construct WirelessMathBench-XL, a comprehensive benchmark of 4,027
problems from 970 papers. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with
binary verification rewards, we train models directly from base checkpoints
without supervised warm-start. Our 7B model achieves 39.5% accuracy on
WirelessMathBench-XL, approaching GPT-4o (40.4%) while using about 100 times
fewer parameters than DeepSeek-R1 (671B, 57.4%). Remarkably, GRPO training
nearly doubles performance across all model scales (0.5B +11%, 3B +103%, 7B
+81%), with positive transfer to general mathematics benchmarks--our models
gain +8.4 points on average across MATH, Minerva-Math, OlympiadBench, AMC, and
AIME without any training on these tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPEC-RL reduces the computational time needed for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards in large language models by using speculative decoding during rollouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The training process in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards is hindered by computationally expensive rollouts, which often involve redundant generation of overlapping segments.

Method: The paper introduces SPEC-RL, a framework that uses past trajectory segments as speculative prefixes during the rollout process, combining them with a draft-and-verify mechanism to prevent redundant generation while maintaining policy consistency.

Result: SPEC-RL achieves a 2-3x reduction in rollout time while maintaining the quality of the reinforcement learning policy. Experiments on various benchmarks showcase its effectiveness.

Conclusion: SPEC-RL provides a computationally efficient enhancement to the rollout stage in large language model training, working seamlessly with existing algorithms and improving scalability without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit reliable chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the training process remains bottlenecked by the computationally
expensive rollout stage. Existing acceleration methods-such as parallelization,
objective- and data-driven modifications, and replay buffers-either incur
diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations.
We identify that rollouts from consecutive training epochs frequently share a
large portion of overlapping segments, wasting computation. To address this, we
propose SPEC-RL, a novel framework that integrates SPECulative decoding with
the RL rollout process. SPEC-RL reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative
prefixes and extends them via a draft-and-verify mechanism, avoiding redundant
generation while ensuring policy consistency. Experiments on diverse math
reasoning and generalization benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500,
OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, and others, demonstrate that SPEC-RL reduces rollout
time by 2-3x without compromising policy quality. As a purely rollout-stage
enhancement, SPEC-RL integrates seamlessly with mainstream algorithms (e.g.,
PPO, GRPO, DAPO), offering a general and practical path to scale RLVR for large
reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShopeeLLM/Spec-RL

*Louise AC Millard,Peter A Flach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) and Brier Curves as model evaluation methods across different classification thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model evaluation should reflect real-world usage, including the trade-offs between correct positive and negative classifications, which affect decision thresholds.

Method: The study analyzed DCA and cost curves, particularly Brier curves, exploring their connections, differences, and applicability in evaluating prediction models.

Result: The analysis reveals that DCA and Brier curves choose the same optimal model at any threshold, but Brier curves are more versatile across a broader range of thresholds.

Conclusion: By emphasizing the overlap and distinct advantages of DCA and Brier curves, the paper highlights that Brier curves are generally more applicable while suggesting a useful recalibration comparison for DCA.

Abstract: Classification models typically predict a score and use a decision threshold
to produce a classification. Appropriate model evaluation should carefully
consider the context in which a model will be used, including the relative
value of correct classifications of positive versus negative examples, which
affects the threshold that should be used. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and
cost curves are model evaluation approaches that assess the expected utility
and expected loss of prediction models, respectively, across decision
thresholds. We compared DCA and cost curves to determine how they are related,
and their strengths and limitations. We demonstrate that decision curves are
closely related to a specific type of cost curve called a Brier curve. Both
curves are derived assuming model scores are calibrated and setting the
classification threshold using the relative value of correct positive and
negative classifications, and the x-axis of both curves are equivalent. Net
benefit (used for DCA) and Brier loss (used for Brier curves) will always
choose the same model as optimal at any given threshold. Across thresholds,
differences in Brier loss are comparable whereas differences in net benefit
cannot be compared. Brier curves are more generally applicable (when a wider
range of thresholds are plausible), and the area under the Brier curve is the
Brier score. We demonstrate that reference lines common in each space can be
included in either and suggest the upper envelope decision curve as a useful
comparison for DCA showing the possible gain in net benefit that could be
achieved through recalibration alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of data-level solutions for deep imbalanced regression tasks, especially for high-dimensional and unstructured data, as existing models mainly rely on algorithmic changes.

Method: The paper introduces LatentDiff, which uses conditional diffusion models with priority-based generation to generate high-quality features in the latent space, suitable for high-dimensional data from various domains.

Result: Experiments on three DIR benchmarks show that LatentDiff significantly enhances the regression performance in minority regions without compromising overall accuracy.

Conclusion: LatentDiff provides a computationally efficient and versatile solution to the challenges of DIR, extending applicability across multiple modalities like images, text, and other high-dimensional datasets.

Abstract: In many real-world regression tasks, the data distribution is heavily skewed,
and models learn predominantly from abundant majority samples while failing to
predict minority labels accurately. While imbalanced classification has been
extensively studied, imbalanced regression remains relatively unexplored. Deep
imbalanced regression (DIR) represents cases where the input data are
high-dimensional and unstructured. Although several data-level approaches for
tabular imbalanced regression exist, deep imbalanced regression currently lacks
dedicated data-level solutions suitable for high-dimensional data and relies
primarily on algorithmic modifications. To fill this gap, we propose
LatentDiff, a novel framework that uses conditional diffusion models with
priority-based generation to synthesize high-quality features in the latent
representation space. LatentDiff is computationally efficient and applicable
across diverse data modalities, including images, text, and other
high-dimensional inputs. Experiments on three DIR benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in minority regions while maintaining overall
accuracy.

### [814] [Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy for LLMs: Not All Tokens Require Equal Protection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23246)
*Manjiang Yu,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li,Yang Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy (ATDP), a method to protect sensitive information in large language models (LLMs) while preserving performance and reducing training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in LLMs caused by memorization of sensitive information, providing a more efficient and less accuracy-degrading solution than existing DPSGD methods.

Method: A novel approach called ATDP is introduced, which applies higher noise scales to gradients related to sensitive tokens and adaptive weighting of gradients during training, reducing noise impact on non-sensitive tokens.

Result: ATDP achieves comparable or superior privacy protection with significantly reduced computational overhead, shortening training time by about 90% compared to traditional DPSGD, with minimal impact on model accuracy.

Conclusion: ATDP is an effective, efficient, and easily integrable method for enhancing privacy in LLMs without compromising general performance, making it a practical alternative to conventional DPSGD.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive or personal
information, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing variants of
differential privacy stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) inject uniform noise
into every gradient step, significantly extending training time and reducing
model accuracy. We propose that concentrating noise primarily on gradients
associated with sensitive tokens can substantially decrease DP training time,
strengthen the protection of sensitive information, and simultaneously preserve
the model's performance on non-sensitive data. We operationalize this insight
through Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy (ATDP), a modification of
vanilla DP-SGD that adaptively assigns different gradient weights to sensitive
and non-sensitive tokens. By employing a larger noise scale at the early stage
of training, ATDP rapidly disrupts memorization of sensitive content. As a
result, ATDP only requires a few additional epochs of lightweight
post-processing following standard fine-tuning, injecting targeted noise
primarily on parameters corresponding to sensitive tokens, thus minimally
affecting the model's general capabilities. ATDP can be seamlessly integrated
into any existing DP-based fine-tuning pipeline or directly applied to
non-private models as a fast privacy-enhancing measure. Additionally, combined
with an initial redacted fine-tuning phase, ATDP forms a streamlined DP
pipeline that achieves comparable canary protection to state-of-the-art DP-SGD
methods, significantly reduces the computational overhead of DP fine-tuning,
shortening training time by approximately 90 percent, while achieving
comparable or superior privacy protection and minimal accuracy degradation.

### [815] [Beyond Softmax: A Natural Parameterization for Categorical Random Variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24728)
*Alessandro Manenti,Cesare Alippi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in using latent categorical variables in deep learning by introducing the 'catnat' function as an alternative to softmax for improved learning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of the softmax function in handling latent categorical variables within deep learning, which impede gradient-descent learning.

Method: The authors replace the softmax function with the 'catnat' function, composed of hierarchical binary splits, and prove its efficiency using the diagonal Fisher Information Matrix.

Result: Experiments across diverse settings like graph structure learning, autoencoders, and reinforcement learning show improved performance and training efficiency for models using 'catnat'.

Conclusion: The 'catnat' function is a superior alternative to softmax, offering better gradient descent behavior, integrating easily into existing frameworks, and supporting standard stabilization techniques.

Abstract: Latent categorical variables are frequently found in deep learning
architectures. They can model actions in discrete reinforcement-learning
environments, represent categories in latent-variable models, or express
relations in graph neural networks. Despite their widespread use, their
discrete nature poses significant challenges to gradient-descent learning
algorithms. While a substantial body of work has offered improved gradient
estimation techniques, we take a complementary approach. Specifically, we: 1)
revisit the ubiquitous $\textit{softmax}$ function and demonstrate its
limitations from an information-geometric perspective; 2) replace the
$\textit{softmax}$ with the $\textit{catnat}$ function, a function composed of
a sequence of hierarchical binary splits; we prove that this choice offers
significant advantages to gradient descent due to the resulting diagonal Fisher
Information Matrix. A rich set of experiments - including graph structure
learning, variational autoencoders, and reinforcement learning - empirically
show that the proposed function improves the learning efficiency and yields
models characterized by consistently higher test performance. $\textit{Catnat}$
is simple to implement and seamlessly integrates into existing codebases.
Moreover, it remains compatible with standard training stabilization techniques
and, as such, offers a better alternative to the $\textit{softmax}$ function.

*Vladimir Fanaskov,Vladislav Trifonov,Alexander Rudikov,Ekaterina Muravleva,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using neural networks to approximate subspaces in high-dimensional problems by regression instead of classical interpolation, showing improved accuracy with redundancy in subspace prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduced order modeling can capture system dynamics using linear subspaces, but classical interpolation strategies fail for high-dimensional parameter spaces, necessitating alternative approaches.

Method: The paper employs regression on subspace data using neural networks and introduces redundancy by predicting larger subspaces, making the mapping smoother and computationally easier.

Result: Theoretical analysis demonstrates reduced complexity and smoother mappings, while empirical results confirm improved accuracy when predicting larger-than-needed subspaces.

Conclusion: The proposed subspace regression approach proves effective for various computational tasks, enhancing accuracy and applicability in high-dimensional parametric problems.

Abstract: It is often possible to perform reduced order modelling by specifying linear
subspace which accurately captures the dynamics of the system. This approach
becomes especially appealing when linear subspace explicitly depends on
parameters of the problem. A practical way to apply such a scheme is to compute
subspaces for a selected set of parameters in the computationally demanding
offline stage and in the online stage approximate subspace for unknown
parameters by interpolation. For realistic problems the space of parameters is
high dimensional, which renders classical interpolation strategies infeasible
or unreliable. We propose to relax the interpolation problem to regression,
introduce several loss functions suitable for subspace data, and use a neural
network as an approximation to high-dimensional target function. To further
simplify a learning problem we introduce redundancy: in place of predicting
subspace of a given dimension we predict larger subspace. We show theoretically
that this strategy decreases the complexity of the mapping for elliptic
eigenproblems with constant coefficients and makes the mapping smoother for
general smooth function on the Grassmann manifold. Empirical results also show
that accuracy significantly improves when larger-than-needed subspaces are
predicted. With the set of numerical illustrations we demonstrate that subspace
regression can be useful for a range of tasks including parametric
eigenproblems, deflation techniques, relaxation methods, optimal control and
solution of parametric partial differential equations.

*Zhijian Xu,Wanxu Cai,Xilin Dai,Zhaorong Deng,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a lack of high-quality benchmarks for evaluating time series forecasting models and introduces Fidel-TS benchmark to address this gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing forecasting benchmarks suffer from issues like data contamination and causal leakage, hindering accurate evaluation of forecasting models.

Method: The authors formalize principles for high-fidelity benchmarking and create Fidel-TS using data from live APIs, ensuring integrity, causality, and structural clarity.

Result: Experiments with Fidel-TS expose biases in prior benchmarks and highlight the causal relevance of textual information for improved forecasting.

Conclusion: Fidel-TS sets a high standard for benchmark quality and emphasizes the importance of causally relevant data in multimodal forecasting advancements.

Abstract: The evaluation of time series forecasting models is hindered by a critical
lack of high-quality benchmarks, leading to a potential illusion of progress.
Existing datasets suffer from issues ranging from pre-training data
contamination in the age of LLMs to the causal and description leakage
prevalent in early multimodal designs. To address this, we formalize the core
principles of high-fidelity benchmarking, focusing on data sourcing integrity,
strict causal soundness, and structural clarity. We introduce Fidel-TS, a new
large-scale benchmark built from the ground up on these principles by sourcing
data from live APIs. Our extensive experiments validate this approach by
exposing the critical biases and design limitations of prior benchmarks.
Furthermore, we conclusively demonstrate that the causal relevance of textual
information is the key factor in unlocking genuine performance gains in
multimodal forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NanoFlux introduces a novel adversarial approach to create small, targeted datasets for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning, showing superior results with fewer examples and reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address inefficiencies in large language model training by proposing a method to generate highly effective training data while minimizing computational resources.

Method: NanoFlux uses an adversarial dynamic between Attacker and Defender models, supervised by a tool-augmented Judge, to produce targeted multi-step questions and annotations. It also employs novelty filtering and tool-assisted evaluation to enhance dataset quality.

Result: Fine-tuning a 4B-parameter model on NanoFlux datasets yields substantial improvements in mathematical (+5.9%), scientific (+3.6%), and medical reasoning (+16.6%) compared to conventional methods, with 3-14x reduction in computational requirements.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that intelligently engineered small datasets can outperform traditional large-scale training approaches, pointing toward the potential of targeted data synthesis for LLM performance enhancement.

Abstract: We present NanoFlux, a novel adversarial framework for generating targeted
training data to improve LLM reasoning, where adversarially-generated datasets
containing fewer than 200 examples outperform conventional fine-tuning
approaches. The framework employs a competitive dynamic between models
alternating as Attacker and Defender, supervised by a tool-augmented Judge,
synthesizing multi-step questions with explanatory annotations that target
specific reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning a 4B-parameter model on
NanoFlux-generated data yields performance gains across diverse domains
compared to full-benchmark fine-tuning: +5.9% on mathematical reasoning
(GSMHard), +3.6% on scientific reasoning (GenomeBench), and +16.6% on medical
reasoning (MultiMedQA), while reducing computational requirements by 3-14x.
Ablation studies reveal a non-monotonic relationship between dataset
characteristics and model performance, uncovering domain-specific optimal
points for question complexity and reasoning quality. NanoFlux automates
training data generation through embedding-based novelty filtering,
tool-augmented evaluation, and multi-hop reasoning, suggesting that future
model improvements may lie in the intelligent synthesis of small, precisely
targeted training datasets.

*Zhang-Yu You,Jiahao Ma,Hongzong Li,Ye-Fan Hu,Jian-Dong Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ABCONFORMER, a sequence-based model for predicting antibody-antigen interactions, achieving state-of-the-art precision without reliance on 3D structural data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately predicting Ab-Ag interfaces is essential for vaccine design and therapeutic antibody development, but current sequence-based methods face reliability challenges.

Method: ABCONFORMER employs a Conformer backbone with sliding attention, inspired by physics, to predict interactions from sequences without needing 3D structural data.

Result: The model demonstrated superior performance in predicting paratopes, epitopes, and pan-epitopes compared to existing methods, especially for antibody-agnostic epitope prediction.

Conclusion: Sliding attention improves epitope prediction accuracy, and the release of open-source code ensures reproducibility.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) interfaces is critical for
vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, and therapeutic antibody development.
However, achieving reliable predictions from sequences alone remains a
challenge. In this paper, we present ABCONFORMER, a model based on the
Conformer backbone that captures both local and global features of a
biosequence. To accurately capture Ab-Ag interactions, we introduced the
physics-inspired sliding attention, enabling residue-level contact recovery
without relying on three-dimensional structural data. ABConformer can
accurately predict paratopes and epitopes given the antibody and antigen
sequence, and predict pan-epitopes on the antigen without antibody information.
In comparison experiments, ABCONFORMER achieves state-of-the-art performance on
a recent SARS-CoV-2 Ab-Ag dataset, and surpasses widely used sequence-based
methods for antibody-agnostic epitope prediction. Ablation studies further
quantify the contribution of each component, demonstrating that, compared to
conventional cross-attention, sliding attention significantly enhances the
precision of epitope prediction. To facilitate reproducibility, we will release
the code under an open-source license upon acceptance.

*Leonardo Defilippis,Yizhou Xu,Julius Girardin,Emanuele Troiani,Vittorio Erba,Lenka Zdeborová,Bruno Loureiro,Florent Krzakala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores neural scaling laws by analyzing scaling behaviors in quadratic and diagonal neural networks, focusing on generalization performance and spectral properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural scaling laws have been empirically observed in deep learning advancements but lack sufficient theoretical understanding beyond linear models.

Method: The study systematically analyzes scaling laws by using theoretical concepts like matrix compressed sensing and LASSO, and derives phase diagrams for scaling exponents linked to sample complexity and weight decay.

Result: The analysis reveals transitions between different scaling regimes, plateau behaviors, and establishes a connection between weight spectra and network generalization.

Conclusion: The paper validates empirical observations of power-law tails in weight spectra influencing generalization performance and offers a foundational theoretical understanding of these phenomena.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws underlie many of the recent advances in deep learning,
yet their theoretical understanding remains largely confined to linear models.
In this work, we present a systematic analysis of scaling laws for quadratic
and diagonal neural networks in the feature learning regime. Leveraging
connections with matrix compressed sensing and LASSO, we derive a detailed
phase diagram for the scaling exponents of the excess risk as a function of
sample complexity and weight decay. This analysis uncovers crossovers between
distinct scaling regimes and plateau behaviors, mirroring phenomena widely
reported in the empirical neural scaling literature. Furthermore, we establish
a precise link between these regimes and the spectral properties of the trained
network weights, which we characterize in detail. As a consequence, we provide
a theoretical validation of recent empirical observations connecting the
emergence of power-law tails in the weight spectrum with network generalization
performance, yielding an interpretation from first principles.

*Jiajun He,Paul Jeha,Peter Potaptchik,Leo Zhang,José Miguel Hernández-Lobato,Yuanqi Du,Saifuddin Syed,Francisco Vargas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CREPE, a novel replica exchange-based method for inference-time control in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing approaches for inference-time control in diffusion models, such as heuristic methods and SMC-based corrections.

Method: Developed the CREPE method leveraging replica exchange, generating sequential particles, preserving sample diversity, and allowing online refinement.

Result: Demonstrates competitive performance in tasks like annealing, reward-tilting, model composition, and debiasing compared to SMC methods.

Conclusion: CREPE presents a flexible and effective alternative to existing methods for controlling diffusion model outputs at inference time.

Abstract: Inference-time control of diffusion models aims to steer model outputs to
satisfy new constraints without retraining. Previous approaches have mostly
relied on heuristic guidance or have been coupled with Sequential Monte Carlo
(SMC) for bias correction. In this paper, we propose a flexible alternative
based on replica exchange, an algorithm designed initially for sampling
problems. We refer to this method as the CREPE (Controlling with REPlica
Exchange). Unlike SMC, CREPE: (1) generates particles sequentially, (2)
maintains high diversity in the generated samples after a burn-in period, and
(3) enables online refinement or early termination. We demonstrate its
versatility across various tasks, including temperature annealing,
reward-tilting, model composition and classifier-free guidance debiasing, with
competitive performance compared to prior SMC methods.

*Valentyn Melnychuk,Dennis Frauen,Jonas Schweisthal,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Overlap-Adaptive Regularization (OAR) to improve Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) estimation in low-overlap regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current meta-learners for CATE estimation perform poorly in regions with low overlap, impacting the effectiveness of personalized medicine therapeutic decisions.

Method: The OAR method regularizes models based on overlap weights, applying stronger regularization in low-overlap regions. It is flexible and compatible with both parametric and non-parametric meta-learners.

Result: OAR enhances CATE estimation accuracy, especially in low-overlap regions, as demonstrated through semi-synthetic experiments.

Conclusion: OAR is a groundbreaking technique that leverages overlap weights for regularization, improving meta-learner performance while maintaining robust inference.

Abstract: The conditional average treatment effect (CATE) is widely used in
personalized medicine to inform therapeutic decisions. However,
state-of-the-art methods for CATE estimation (so-called meta-learners) often
perform poorly in the presence of low overlap. In this work, we introduce a new
approach to tackle this issue and improve the performance of existing
meta-learners in the low-overlap regions. Specifically, we introduce
Overlap-Adaptive Regularization (OAR) that regularizes target models
proportionally to overlap weights so that, informally, the regularization is
higher in regions with low overlap. To the best of our knowledge, our OAR is
the first approach to leverage overlap weights in the regularization terms of
the meta-learners. Our OAR approach is flexible and works with any existing
CATE meta-learner: we demonstrate how OAR can be applied to both parametric and
non-parametric second-stage models. Furthermore, we propose debiased versions
of our OAR that preserve the Neyman-orthogonality of existing meta-learners and
thus ensure more robust inference. Through a series of (semi-)synthetic
experiments, we demonstrate that our OAR significantly improves CATE estimation
in low-overlap settings in comparison to constant regularization.

TL;DR: This study evaluates machine learning (ML), transfer learning, and ensemble integration for enhancing breast cancer survival prognostication compared to a pre-trained tool, PREDICT v3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores more accessible and cost-efficient prognostication options using ML techniques as alternatives to current genomic tools, especially when handling missing data or dataset shifts.

Method: The study uses data from the MA.27 trial for model training, external validation on the TEAM trial and SEER cohort, applying de-novo ML models, transfer learning, and an ensemble integration approach.

Result: Transfer learning, de-novo Random Survival Forests (RSF), and ensemble integration demonstrated improved calibration over the pre-trained model and better managed missing data. Validation in SEER confirmed the strengths of these methods.

Conclusion: The proposed methods outperform traditional tools like PREDICT v3, offering robust prognostication even in complex scenarios with missing data or dataset shifts, thus enhancing breast cancer management decision-making.

Abstract: Prognostic information is essential for decision-making in breast cancer
management. Recently trials have predominantly focused on genomic
prognostication tools, even though clinicopathological prognostication is less
costly and more widely accessible. Machine learning (ML), transfer learning and
ensemble integration offer opportunities to build robust prognostication
frameworks. We evaluate this potential to improve survival prognostication in
breast cancer by comparing de-novo ML, transfer learning from a pre-trained
prognostic tool and ensemble integration. Data from the MA.27 trial was used
for model training, with external validation on the TEAM trial and a SEER
cohort. Transfer learning was applied by fine-tuning the pre-trained prognostic
tool PREDICT v3, de-novo ML included Random Survival Forests and Extreme
Gradient Boosting, and ensemble integration was realized through a weighted sum
of model predictions. Transfer learning, de-novo RSF, and ensemble integration
improved calibration in MA.27 over the pre-trained model (ICI reduced from
0.042 in PREDICT v3 to <=0.007) while discrimination remained comparable (AUC
increased from 0.738 in PREDICT v3 to 0.744-0.799). Invalid PREDICT v3
predictions were observed in 23.8-25.8% of MA.27 individuals due to missing
information. In contrast, ML models and ensemble integration could predict
survival regardless of missing information. Across all models, patient age,
nodal status, pathological grading and tumor size had the highest SHAP values,
indicating their importance for survival prognostication. External validation
in SEER, but not in TEAM, confirmed the benefits of transfer learning, RSF and
ensemble integration. This study demonstrates that transfer learning, de-novo
RSF, and ensemble integration can improve prognostication in situations where
relevant information for PREDICT v3 is lacking or where a dataset shift is
likely.

TL;DR: The paper examines token dynamics in transformer models using mean-field particle system principles, focusing on multiscale behavior across three phases: rapid collapse, clustering, and merging, supported by theoretical analysis and simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how tokens evolve within encoder-only transformer models during inference, exploring their interaction dynamics and collective behavior.

Method: The authors modeled tokens as particles in a mean-field system under moderate interaction conditions, characterized their dynamics mathematically, and categorized multiscale behavioral phases, supported by theoretical proofs and simulations.

Result: The study identifies three distinct dynamics phases—empirical collapse, clustering, and sequential merging—as tokens evolve. Rigorous mathematical proofs validate these observations and simulations illustrate the dynamics.

Conclusion: The findings explain token interactions and multiscale dynamics within encoder-only transformer models, offering insights into their inference-time behavior and advancing theoretical understanding of these architectures.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the evolution of tokens through the depth of
encoder-only transformer models at inference time by modeling them as a system
of particles interacting in a mean-field way and studying the corresponding
dynamics. More specifically, we consider this problem in the moderate
interaction regime, where the number $N$ of tokens is large and the inverse
temperature parameter $\beta$ of the model scales together with $N$. In this
regime, the dynamics of the system displays a multiscale behavior: a fast
phase, where the token empirical measure collapses on a low-dimensional space,
an intermediate phase, where the measure further collapses into clusters, and a
slow one, where such clusters sequentially merge into a single one. We provide
a rigorous characterization of the limiting dynamics in each of these phases
and prove convergence in the above mentioned limit, exemplifying our results
with some simulations.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework tailored for Asset-Liability Management (ALM) that surpasses existing strategies in randomized market scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in improving Asset-Liability Management (ALM) frameworks by leveraging continuous-time RL to dynamically optimize financial objectives.

Method: The method involves a soft actor-critic algorithm with adaptive exploration for balanced learning and directly learning optimal ALM strategies without prior environment modeling.

Result: The approach demonstrates superior performance over enhanced traditional strategies and existing state-of-the-art RL methods across 200 randomized market scenarios.

Conclusion: The results suggest that a directly learned optimal ALM strategy via RL is effective in achieving robust rewards without complex network architectures or environmental modeling.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for Asset-Liability Management (ALM) by
employing continuous-time Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a linear-quadratic
(LQ) formulation that incorporates both interim and terminal objectives. We
develop a model-free, policy gradient-based soft actor-critic algorithm
tailored to ALM for dynamically synchronizing assets and liabilities. To ensure
an effective balance between exploration and exploitation with minimal tuning,
we introduce adaptive exploration for the actor and scheduled exploration for
the critic. Our empirical study evaluates this approach against two enhanced
traditional financial strategies, a model-based continuous-time RL method, and
three state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Evaluated across 200 randomized market
scenarios, our method achieves higher average rewards than all alternative
strategies, with rapid initial gains and sustained superior performance. The
outperformance stems not from complex neural networks or improved parameter
estimation, but from directly learning the optimal ALM strategy without
learning the environment.

*Daniil Dmitriev,Harald Eskelund Franck,Carolin Heinzler,Amartya Sanyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a learning-theoretic framework to address the implications of machine learning systems training on self-annotated data, specifically in scenarios prone to 'echo chamber' errors. New theoretical constructs and bounds for addressing this are proposed and analyzed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to model and analyze the risks of machine learning systems becoming self-reinforcing in their errors when learning on self-annotated data. Traditional algorithms are shown to falter under these conditions, necessitating new measures and frameworks.

Method: The authors introduce the 'Online Learning in the Replay Setting' model, where a learner receives true or previously replayed labels. They define the Extended Threshold dimension (ExThD) as the core measure of learnability and develop a closure-based learner to demonstrate its effectiveness against adversaries.

Result: The paper establishes tight upper and lower bounds for the framework. It shows that the replay setting is harder than the classical mistake bound setting, with strong separations between proper and improper learning under these conditions. Improper learners achieve results in line with ExThD bounds, unlike proper learners.

Conclusion: The study provides the first exhaustive analysis of learning in replay-adversarial environments. It highlights the theoretical challenges, introduces novel measures like ExThD, and offers algorithms with guaranteed performance under varying adversary types.

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly train on self-annotated data, they
risk reinforcing errors and becoming echo chambers of their own beliefs. We
model this phenomenon by introducing a learning-theoretic framework: Online
Learning in the Replay Setting. In round $t$, the learner outputs a hypothesis
$\hat{h}_t$; the adversary then reveals either the true label $f^\ast(x_t)$ or
a replayed label $\hat{h}_i(x_t)$ from an earlier round $i < t$. A mistake is
counted only when the true label is shown, yet classical algorithms such as the
SOA or the halving algorithm are easily misled by the replayed errors.
  We introduce the Extended Threshold dimension, $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$,
and prove matching upper and lower bounds that make
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ the exact measure of learnability in this model.
A closure-based learner makes at most $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ mistakes
against any adaptive adversary, and no algorithm can perform better. For
stochastic adversaries, we prove a similar bound for every intersection-closed
class. The replay setting is provably harder than the classical mistake bound
setting: some classes have constant Littlestone dimension but arbitrarily large
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$. Proper learning exhibits an even sharper
separation: a class is properly learnable under replay if and only if it is
(almost) intersection-closed. Otherwise, every proper learner suffers
$\Omega(T)$ errors, whereas our improper algorithm still achieves the
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ bound. These results give the first tight
analysis of learning against replay adversaries, based on new results for
closure-type algorithms.

Conclusion: NODE-FDM demonstrates the potential of physics-informed neural ODEs in aircraft performance modeling, despite limitations in physical constraints and QAR data availability. Future work will extend its capabilities to lateral dynamics.

Abstract: Accurate aircraft trajectory prediction is critical for air traffic
management, airline operations, and environmental assessment. This paper
introduces NODE-FDM, a Neural Ordinary Differential Equations-based Flight
Dynamics Model trained on Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data. By combining
analytical kinematic relations with data-driven components, NODE-FDM achieves a
more accurate reproduction of recorded trajectories than state-of-the-art
models such as a BADA-based trajectory generation methodology (BADA4
performance model combined with trajectory control routines), particularly in
the descent phase of the flight. The analysis demonstrates marked improvements
across altitude, speed, and mass dynamics. Despite current limitations,
including limited physical constraints and the limited availability of QAR
data, the results demonstrate the potential of physics-informed neural ordinary
differential equations as a high-fidelity, data-driven approach to aircraft
performance modelling. Future work will extend the framework to incorporate a
full modelling of the lateral dynamics of the aircraft.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand when and how attention mechanisms selectively focus on tokens to enhance detection of sparse, weak, and rare features in classification tasks.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze a sparse-token classification model and derive proofs showing attention classifiers outperform linear ones, using scaling conditions and finite-training updates.

Result: Attention classifiers achieve better performance in the long-sequence limit, requiring only logarithmic signal strength scaling with sequence length, and benefit from fast alignment after few gradient updates.

Conclusion: Adaptive attention mechanisms can amplify informative tokens, allowing classifiers to achieve better separability and lower test error compared to non-adaptive linear models.

Abstract: When and how can an attention mechanism learn to selectively attend to
informative tokens, thereby enabling detection of weak, rare, and sparsely
located features? We address these questions theoretically in a sparse-token
classification model in which positive samples embed a weak signal vector in a
randomly chosen subset of tokens, whereas negative samples are pure noise. In
the long-sequence limit, we show that a simple single-layer attention
classifier can in principle achieve vanishing test error when the signal
strength grows only logarithmically in the sequence length $L$, whereas linear
classifiers require $\sqrt{L}$ scaling. Moving from representational power to
learnability, we study training at finite $L$ in a high-dimensional regime,
where sample size and embedding dimension grow proportionally. We prove that
just two gradient updates suffice for the query weight vector of the attention
classifier to acquire a nontrivial alignment with the hidden signal, inducing
an attention map that selectively amplifies informative tokens. We further
derive an exact asymptotic expression for the test error and training loss of
the trained attention-based classifier, and quantify its capacity -- the
largest dataset size that is typically perfectly separable -- thereby
explaining the advantage of adaptive token selection over nonadaptive linear
baselines.

*Xvyuan Liu,Xiangfei Qiu,Hanyin Cheng,Xingjian Wu,Chenjuan Guo,Bin Yang,Jilin Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework to address irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) challenges, achieving state-of-the-art forecasting results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals in IMTS, which complicate accurate representation of raw data without distortion and effective modeling of dynamic dependencies.

Method: ASTGI includes four key components: a Spatio-Temporal Point Representation module to encode discrete observations, a Neighborhood-Adaptive Graph Construction module to build causal graphs, a Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module for iterative updates, and a Query Point-based Prediction module for final forecasting.

Result: The ASTGI framework achieves superior performance compared to various state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated through experiments on multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: ASTGI effectively handles the challenges in IMTS by accurately representing data and capturing dynamic dependencies, paving the way for improved forecasting in critical domains like healthcare and finance.

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are prevalent in critical domains
like healthcare and finance, where accurate forecasting is vital for proactive
decision-making. However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals
inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to
accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without
introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex
dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges,
we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework.
Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point
Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a
learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive
Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in
the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a
Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on
these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction
weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points.
Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by
aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing
regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.

*Peter Holderrieth,Uriel Singer,Tommi Jaakkola,Ricky T. Q. Chen,Yaron Lipman,Brian Karrer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces GLASS Flows, a novel sampling paradigm that enhances inference-time efficiency for flow matching and diffusion models while maintaining stochastic evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward alignment algorithms boost the performance of flow matching and diffusion models at inference time, but inefficiencies in current sampling methods create a bottleneck.

Method: GLASS Flows simulate a 'flow matching model within a flow matching model' to sample Markov transitions, leveraging a pre-trained model without re-training.

Result: GLASS Flows combine the efficiency of ODEs and the stochasticity of SDEs, improving large-scale text-to-image generation and eliminating the trade-off between stochastic evolution and efficiency.

Conclusion: GLASS Flows serve as a practical, scalable, and high-performing solution to enhance inference-time processes in flow and diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art advancements.

Abstract: The performance of flow matching and diffusion models can be greatly improved
at inference time using reward alignment algorithms, yet efficiency remains a
major limitation. While several algorithms were proposed, we demonstrate that a
common bottleneck is the sampling method these algorithms rely on: many
algorithms require to sample Markov transitions via SDE sampling, which is
significantly less efficient and often less performant than ODE sampling. To
remove this bottleneck, we introduce GLASS Flows, a new sampling paradigm that
simulates a "flow matching model within a flow matching model" to sample Markov
transitions. As we show in this work, this "inner" flow matching model can be
retrieved from a pre-trained model without any re-training, combining the
efficiency of ODEs with the stochastic evolution of SDEs. On large-scale
text-to-image models, we show that GLASS Flows eliminate the trade-off between
stochastic evolution and efficiency. Combined with Feynman-Kac Steering, GLASS
Flows improve state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, making
it a simple, drop-in solution for inference-time scaling of flow and diffusion
models.

*Francesco Pappone,Donato Crisostomi,Emanuele Rodolà*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Recurrent-depth transformers refine computations geometrically, enabling effective token emission and enhanced test-time efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve token prediction processes, particularly the efficiency and stability of iterative latent computations in transformers.

Method: The paper examined the geometric dynamics of iterative latent computations, proposing a two-scale operational framework (small refinements vs large drift) and introducing a novel, second-order difference-based early-exit mechanism.

Result: The second-order difference-based early-exit strategy outperformed existing methods, enhancing performance, computational stability, and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanism allows recurrent-depth transformers to better balance computation refinement and drift, optimizing test-time processes while maintaining modeling accuracy.

Abstract: Recurrent-depth transformers scale test-time compute by iterating latent
computations before emitting tokens. We study the geometry of these iterates
and argue for a simple, \emph{two-scale} operational picture: (i) within a
looped block, updates act as \emph{small-scale refinements}; (ii) across
consecutive blocks, states undergo a \emph{larger-scale drift}. Across
checkpoints, our measurements show that loop steps become \emph{smaller} and
increasingly \emph{orthogonal} to one another, indicating better local modeling
of fine structure rather than merely pushing in a single direction. These
dynamics motivate an early-exit mechanism based on the model's second-order
difference in step-size, which we show is superior in terms of performance,
stability and time-efficiency, when compared to the KL-divergence exit strategy
of Geiping et al. and its naive first-order counterpart.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MELCOT, a hybrid regression model for high-dimensional matrix data that combines classical and deep learning approaches, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve regression performance for high-dimensional matrix-valued data, addressing issues like loss of spatial structure and high storage demand in existing methods.

Method: The method involves combining a Marginal Estimation (ME) block to estimate spatial features with a Learnable-Cost Optimal Transport (LCOT) block to learn global features, creating a hybrid model.

Result: MELCOT shows superior performance compared to all baseline methods in various datasets, demonstrating both efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: MELCOT effectively merges classical and deep learning techniques, offering both high accuracy and computational efficiency for matrix-valued regression problems.

Abstract: Regression is essential across many domains but remains challenging in
high-dimensional settings, where existing methods often lose spatial structure
or demand heavy storage. In this work, we address the problem of matrix-valued
regression, where each sample is naturally represented as a matrix. We propose
MELCOT, a hybrid model that integrates a classical machine learning-based
Marginal Estimation (ME) block with a deep learning-based Learnable-Cost
Optimal Transport (LCOT) block. The ME block estimates data marginals to
preserve spatial information, while the LCOT block learns complex global
features. This design enables MELCOT to inherit the strengths of both classical
and deep learning methods. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and
domains demonstrate that MELCOT consistently outperforms all baselines while
remaining highly efficient.

*Xiangchen Song,Jiaqi Sun,Zijian Li,Yujia Zheng,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework combining identifiable temporal causal representation learning with sparse autoencoders to better understand Large Language Models' (LLMs) internal mechanisms, addressing limitations in temporal and causal dependency modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the challenges in mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, as existing tools lack the ability to model temporal and instantaneous causal relationships effectively and do not provide theoretical guarantees.

Method: The authors develop a framework that integrates identifiable temporal causal representation learning with sparse autoencoders to model high-dimensional concepts in LLMs. The framework captures both time-delayed and instantaneous causal relations and is scalable to complex conceptual spaces.

Result: Their approach, validated on synthetic datasets reflecting real-world complexity, successfully uncovers meaningful conceptual relationships within LLM activations, demonstrating both theoretical soundness and practical efficacy.

Conclusion: Incorporating temporal and instantaneous causal relationships substantially enhances the interpretability of LLMs, providing a robust tool for understanding their internal representations.

Abstract: Despite Large Language Models' remarkable capabilities, understanding their
internal representations remains challenging. Mechanistic interpretability
tools such as sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were developed to extract
interpretable features from LLMs but lack temporal dependency modeling,
instantaneous relation representation, and more importantly theoretical
guarantees, undermining both the theoretical foundations and the practical
confidence necessary for subsequent analyses. While causal representation
learning (CRL) offers theoretically grounded approaches for uncovering latent
concepts, existing methods cannot scale to LLMs' rich conceptual space due to
inefficient computation. To bridge the gap, we introduce an identifiable
temporal causal representation learning framework specifically designed for
LLMs' high-dimensional concept space, capturing both time-delayed and
instantaneous causal relations. Our approach provides theoretical guarantees
and demonstrates efficacy on synthetic datasets scaled to match real-world
complexity. By extending SAE techniques with our temporal causal framework, we
successfully discover meaningful concept relationships in LLM activations. Our
findings show that modeling both temporal and instantaneous conceptual
relationships advances the interpretability of LLMs.

*Jonas Ngnawé,Maxime Heuillet,Sabyasachi Sahoo,Yann Pequignot,Ola Ahmad,Audrey Durand,Frédéric Precioso,Christian Gagné*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-tuning pretrained models for robustness against adversarial examples is challenging, often leading to transfer failures. This paper introduces 'Epsilon-Scheduling' to enhance robust fine-tuning (RFT) effectiveness and proposes a metric, 'expected robustness,' for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty and knowledge gap in robust fine-tuning (RFT) using non-robust pretrained models.

Method: The study introduces 'Epsilon-Scheduling,' a training heuristic that adjusts perturbation strength, and 'expected robustness,' a metric for comprehensive accuracy-robustness evaluation.

Result: Experiments on six pretrained models and five datasets demonstrate that Epsilon-Scheduling prevents suboptimal transfer and significantly improves expected robustness across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: Epsilon-Scheduling is a successful solution for improving robustness and task adaptation during fine-tuning, allowing for effective use of non-robust pretrained models under adversarial perturbations.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models is a standard and effective workflow in modern
machine learning. However, robust fine-tuning (RFT), which aims to
simultaneously achieve adaptation to a downstream task and robustness to
adversarial examples, remains challenging. Despite the abundance of non-robust
pretrained models in open-source repositories, their potential for RFT is less
understood. We address this knowledge gap by systematically examining RFT from
such non-robust models. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning non-robust
models with a robust objective, even under small perturbations, can lead to
poor performance, a phenomenon that we dub \emph{suboptimal transfer}. In
challenging scenarios (eg, difficult tasks, high perturbation), the resulting
performance can be so low that it may be considered a transfer failure. We find
that fine-tuning using a robust objective impedes task adaptation at the
beginning of training and eventually prevents optimal transfer. However, we
propose a novel heuristic, \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling}, a schedule over
perturbation strength used during training that promotes optimal transfer.
Additionally, we introduce \emph{expected robustness}, a metric that captures
performance across a range of perturbations, providing a more comprehensive
evaluation of the accuracy-robustness trade-off for diverse models at test
time. Extensive experiments on a wide range of configurations (six pretrained
models and five datasets) show that \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling} successfully
prevents \emph{suboptimal transfer} and consistently improves expected
robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark to evaluate Schrödinger Bridge (SB) methods on discrete spaces, alongside presenting new algorithms and extending prior works.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of reliable evaluation methods for Schrödinger Bridge (SB) solutions in discrete domains, despite the growing interest and applications in modern machine learning.

Method: The authors construct a benchmark with pairs of probability distributions that have analytically known SB solutions. They develop two new SB algorithms (DLightSB, DLightSB-M) and extend existing methods to create the α-CSBM algorithm.

Result: The benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of SB methods, and the study showcases its utility by evaluating both existing and new algorithms in high-dimensional discrete settings.

Conclusion: This work introduces the first reliable benchmark for SB methods in discrete spaces, offering tools for more reproducible and rigorous future studies in this area.

Abstract: The Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem and its dynamic counterpart, the
Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) problem, play an important role in modern machine
learning, linking generative modeling with optimal transport theory. While
recent advances in discrete diffusion and flow models have sparked growing
interest in applying SB methods to discrete domains, there is still no reliable
way to evaluate how well these methods actually solve the underlying problem.
We address this challenge by introducing a benchmark for SB on discrete spaces.
Our construction yields pairs of probability distributions with analytically
known SB solutions, enabling rigorous evaluation. As a byproduct of building
this benchmark, we obtain two new SB algorithms, DLightSB and DLightSB-M, and
additionally extend prior related work to construct the $\alpha$-CSBM
algorithm. We demonstrate the utility of our benchmark by evaluating both
existing and new solvers in high-dimensional discrete settings. This work
provides the first step toward proper evaluation of SB methods on discrete
spaces, paving the way for more reproducible future studies.

*Hanlin Zhu,Shibo Hao,Zhiting Hu,Jiantao Jiao,Stuart Russell,Yuandong Tian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies how gradient-based training leads to emergent superposition mechanisms in continuous chain-of-thought reasoning for a transformer solving graph reachability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how superposition mechanisms, key for reasoning in continuous chain-of-thought, naturally emerge through gradient-based training.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze the training dynamics of a simplified two-layer transformer during solving directed graph reachability in two stages: thought-generation and prediction.

Result: The paper identifies that the index-matching logit increases initially and then stabilizes, balancing exploration and exploitation which leads to reasoning traces' superposition.

Conclusion: The bounded growth of index-matching logits during training enables LLMs to balance local exploration and global uncertainty, validating the emergence of superposition reasoning experimentally.

Abstract: Previous work shows that the chain of continuous thought (continuous CoT)
improves the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by enabling
implicit parallel thinking, and a subsequent work provided theoretical insight
by showing that a two-layer transformer equipped with continuous CoT can
efficiently solve directed graph reachability by maintaining a superposition of
multiple reasoning traces in the continuous thought. However, it remains
unclear how the superposition mechanism is naturally learned from
gradient-based training methods. To fill this gap, we theoretically analyze the
training dynamics of a simplified two-layer transformer on the directed graph
reachability problem to unveil how the superposition mechanism emerges during
training in two training stages -- (i) a thought-generation stage that
autoregressively expands the continuous thought, and (ii) a prediction stage
that converts the thought into the final answer. Our analysis reveals that
during training using continuous thought, the index-matching logit, an
important quantity which reflects the strength of the model's local search
ability, will first increase and then remain bounded under mild assumptions.
The bounded index-matching logit effectively balances exploration and
exploitation during the reasoning process: the model will exploit local problem
structures to identify plausible search traces, and assign comparable weights
to multiple such traces to explore when it is uncertain about which solution is
correct, which results in superposition. Our experimental results tracking the
growth of logits further validate our theory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for feature selection in high-dimensional tabular datasets, showing their competitiveness with traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve predictive performance, interpretability, and robustness in high-dimensional datasets by introducing novel feature selection methods.

Method: Four KAN-based feature selection methods ($KAN-L1$, $KAN-L2$, $KAN-SI$, $KAN-KO$) are evaluated against classical baselines across multiple dataset benchmarks using metrics like F1 scores and $R^2$.

Result: KAN selectors demonstrated competitive or superior performance, especially in noisy regression and high-dimensional multi-class classification tasks, but individual limitations ($KAN-L1$ and $KAN-L2$) were noted.

Conclusion: KAN-based feature selection methods offer interpretable and effective alternatives to traditional approaches, capable of handling nonlinear and multivariate feature relevance.

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets require effective feature selection to improve
predictive performance, interpretability, and robustness. We propose and
evaluate feature selection methods for tabular datasets based on
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs), which parameterize feature transformations
through splines, enabling direct access to interpretable importance measures.
We introduce four KAN-based selectors ($\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-L2}$,
$\textit{KAN-SI}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$) and compare them against classical
baselines (LASSO, Random Forest, Mutual Information, SVM-RFE) across multiple
classification and regression tabular dataset benchmarks. Average (over three
retention levels: 20\%, 40\%, and 60\%) F1 scores and $R^2$ score results
reveal that KAN-based selectors, particularly $\textit{KAN-L2}$,
$\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-SI}$, and $\textit{KAN-KO}$, are competitive
with and sometimes superior to classical baselines in structured and synthetic
datasets. However, $\textit{KAN-L1}$ is often too aggressive in regression,
removing useful features, while $\textit{KAN-L2}$ underperforms in
classification, where simple coefficient shrinkage misses complex feature
interactions. $\textit{KAN-L2}$ and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ provide robust
performance on noisy regression datasets and heterogeneous datasets, aligning
closely with ensemble predictors. In classification tasks, KAN selectors such
as $\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$, and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ sometimes
surpass the other selectors by eliminating redundancy, particularly in
high-dimensional multi-class data. Overall, our findings demonstrate that
KAN-based feature selection provides a powerful and interpretable alternative
to traditional methods, capable of uncovering nonlinear and multivariate
feature relevance beyond sparsity or impurity-based measures.

*Xi Ding,Lei Wang,Piotr Koniusz,Yongsheng Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a framework that uses relational graph structures based on model predictions to improve semantic feature representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address noisy inter-class similarities in deep network feature representations that contradict predicted semantics, aiming to enforce class-consistent prediction behavior.

Method: Using parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs), GCR creates feature similarity graphs and aligns them with class-aware masked prediction graphs, employing a multi-layer graph alignment mechanism with adaptive weighting.

Result: GCR enhances semantic structure across networks and datasets, promoting cleaner features, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved generalization without altering model architecture or training methods.

Conclusion: GCR is a lightweight, model-agnostic framework that introduces a novel perspective on learning from prediction structures, improving feature representation and generalization.

Abstract: We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that
injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the
learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature
representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model
to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks
learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities
that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by
introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths.
Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a
global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax
prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces
that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior,
acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR
introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive
weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes.
This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress
noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or
training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic
structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR
promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved
generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction
structure. [Project website](https://darcyddx.github.io/gcr/)

TL;DR: The paper addresses the mismatch between training and inference paths in diffusion language models and introduces a method, Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL), to align these paths, achieving notable improvements across various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the mismatch induced by planners in diffusion language models between the random denoising paths used during training and the planned paths used during inference.

Method: The authors derive a new Planned Evidence Lower Bound (P-ELBO) that incorporates planner-based reverse dynamics into the training objective. They propose Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL), a simple modification to the training loss to align training and inference paths.

Result: PAPL achieves consistent improvements across domains, including 40% better protein sequence modeling, up to 4x improvement in MAUVE for text generation, and a 23% better HumanEval pass@10 for code generation.

Conclusion: PAPL effectively reduces the mismatch between training and inference under planned denoisers, leading to substantial improvements in tasks ranging from protein and text modeling to code generation.

Abstract: Diffusion language models have emerged as a powerful alternative to
autoregressive models, enabling fast inference through flexible and parallel
generation paths. This flexibility is enabled by new sampling strategies, or
planners, that iteratively choose where to denoise along the sequence rather
than sampling uniformly at random. However, by modifying reverse paths,
planners introduce a mismatch between the uniformly random denoising paths used
during training and the planning-based paths used at inference. In this work,
we systematically investigate this mismatch and theoretically show that the
standard discrete diffusion training evidence lower bound (ELBO) does not
accurately describe a denoiser under non-uniform planning. To bridge this gap,
we derive a new Planned Evidence Lower Bound (P-ELBO) that directly
incorporates planner-based reverse dynamics into the training objective.
Building on this, we propose Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL), a simple and
effective modification of the standard masked discrete diffusion loss that
aligns training and inference under planned denoisers. Empirically, PAPL
delivers consistent improvements across domains, including a 40% relative gain
in protein sequence modeling, up to a 4x improvement in MAUVE for text
generation, and a 23% relative gain in HumanEval pass@10 for code generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for multiplex link prediction using multi-view edge classification with attention-based evidence fusion, demonstrating better performance on several datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multiplex link prediction either collapse graph layers or treat them independently, losing inter-layer dependencies and facing scalability challenges.

Method: The proposed framework formulates multiplex link prediction as multi-view edge classification using cross-layer self-attention for evidence fusion. Two specific models, Trans-SLE and Trans-GAT, implement this using transformers and GAT-based encoders.

Result: Experiments on six multiplex datasets show consistent improvements in macro-F1 scores over existing state-of-the-art techniques, proving the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is simple, scalable, and adaptable, providing a more robust way to handle multiplex link prediction with significant improvements in accuracy and compatibility.

Abstract: Multiplex graphs capture diverse relations among shared nodes. Most
predictors either collapse layers or treat them independently. This loses
crucial inter-layer dependencies and struggles with scalability. To overcome
this, we frame multiplex link prediction as multi-view edge classification. For
each node pair, we construct a sequence of per-layer edge views and apply
cross-layer self-attention to fuse evidence for the target layer. We present
two models as instances of this framework: Trans-SLE, a lightweight transformer
over static embeddings, and Trans-GAT, which combines layer-specific GAT
encoders with transformer fusion. To ensure scalability and fairness, we
introduce a Union--Set candidate pool and two leakage-free protocols:
cross-layer and inductive subgraph generalization. Experiments on six public
multiplex datasets show consistent macro-F_1 gains over strong baselines (MELL,
HOPLP-MUL, RMNE). Our approach is simple, scalable, and compatible with both
precomputed embeddings and GNN encoders.

TL;DR: The paper introduces URS, a unified neural routing solver designed to achieve zero-shot generalization across over 100 variants of vehicle routing problems (VRPs) without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural routing solvers face limitations in solving diverse VRP variants due to their reliance on predefined constraints or problem-specific fine-tuning, restricting zero-shot generalization.

Method: URS employs a unified data representation (UDR) to generalize problem coverage, a Mixed Bias Module (MBM) to learn problem biases, and an LLM-driven constraint mechanism to handle problem constraints. It also includes an adaptive parameter generator fine-tuned for zero-shot adaptation.

Result: URS demonstrates the ability to solve more than 100 VRP variants, with over 90 being unseen, consistently producing high-quality solutions without requiring fine-tuning.

Conclusion: URS is a novel, unified neural solver for VRPs that sets new benchmarks by handling over 100 diverse problem variants without specialization or fine-tuning, significantly advancing the field of neural routing solvers.

Abstract: Multi-task neural routing solvers have emerged as a promising paradigm for
their ability to solve multiple vehicle routing problems (VRPs) using a single
model. However, existing neural solvers typically rely on predefined problem
constraints or require per-problem fine-tuning, which substantially limits
their zero-shot generalization ability to unseen VRP variants. To address this
critical bottleneck, we propose URS, a unified neural routing solver capable of
zero-shot generalization across a wide range of unseen VRPs using a single
model without any fine-tuning. The key component of URS is the unified data
representation (UDR), which replaces problem enumeration with data unification,
thereby broadening the problem coverage and reducing reliance on domain
expertise. In addition, we propose a Mixed Bias Module (MBM) to efficiently
learn the geometric and relational biases inherent in various problems. On top
of the proposed UDR, we further develop a parameter generator that adaptively
adjusts the decoder and bias weights of MBM to enhance zero-shot
generalization. Moreover, we propose an LLM-driven constraint satisfaction
mechanism, which translates raw problem descriptions into executable stepwise
masking functions to ensure solution feasibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that URS can consistently produce high-quality solutions for more
than 100 distinct VRP variants without any fine-tuning, which includes more
than 90 unseen variants. To the best of our knowledge, URS is the first neural
solver capable of handling over 100 VRP variants with a single model.

Motivation: To address the scalability challenges posed by the quadratic complexity of softmax attention mechanisms and improve robustness by balancing token participation in attention maps.

Method: LOTFormer leverages entropic optimal transport and learns a low-rank pivot measure to produce a doubly-stochastic attention map, achieving linear-time computation.

Result: Empirical results show LOTFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Long Range Arena benchmark, outperforming prior methods in both accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: LOTFormer successfully combines scalability and robustness by introducing a principled doubly-stochastic and linear-time attention mechanism.

Abstract: Transformers have proven highly effective across a wide range of modalities.
However, the quadratic complexity of the standard softmax attention mechanism
poses a fundamental barrier to scaling them to long context windows. A large
body of work addresses this with linear attention, which reformulates attention
as a kernel function and approximates it with finite feature maps to achieve
linear-time computation. Orthogonal to computational scaling, most attention
mechanisms -- both quadratic and linear -- produce row-normalized maps that can
over-focus on a few tokens, degrading robustness and information flow.
Enforcing doubly-stochastic attention alleviates this by balancing token
participation across rows and columns, but existing doubly-stochastic attention
mechanisms typically introduce substantial overhead, undermining scalability.
We propose LOTFormer, a principled attention mechanism that is simultaneously
linear-time and doubly-stochastic. Our approach exploits the connection between
attention maps and transportation plans between query and key measures. The
central idea is to constrain the transport plan to be low-rank by conditioning
it on a learnable pivot measure with small support. Concretely, we solve two
entropic optimal transport problems (queries $\to$ pivot and pivot $\to$ keys)
and compose them into a conditional (glued) coupling. This yields an attention
matrix that is provably doubly-stochastic, has rank at most $r \ll n$, and
applies to values in $O(nr)$ time without forming the full $n \times n$ map.
The pivot locations and masses are learned end-to-end. Empirically, LOTFormer
achieves state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, surpassing
prior linear and transport-based attention methods in both accuracy and
efficiency.

*Wenhao Yang,Lin Li,Xiaohui Tao,Kaize Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for sensitive data removal during model training to comply with privacy demands while mitigating distributional shifts that harm performance, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to protect user privacy and comply with regulations without compromising predictive model accuracy, especially in scenarios with distribution shifts.

Method: The approach includes factor decorrelation using adaptive weights and iterative updates to reduce redundancy, paired with loss perturbation to safeguard against data leakage during sensitive data removal.

Result: Testing on five benchmark datasets shows superior performance and robustness compared to baseline methods, achieving high predictive accuracy even amid substantial distribution shifts.

Conclusion: The proposed technique demonstrates effectiveness in addressing distribution shifts while fulfilling data privacy requirements, offering a robust solution for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.

Abstract: The imperative of user privacy protection and regulatory compliance
necessitates sensitive data removal in model training, yet this process often
induces distributional shifts that undermine model performance-particularly in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We propose a novel data removal approach
that enhances deep predictive models through factor decorrelation and loss
perturbation. Our approach introduces: (1) a discriminative-preserving factor
decorrelation module employing dynamic adaptive weight adjustment and iterative
representation updating to reduce feature redundancy and minimize inter-feature
correlations. (2) a smoothed data removal mechanism with loss perturbation that
creates information-theoretic safeguards against data leakage during removal
operations. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that our
approach outperforms other baselines and consistently achieves high predictive
accuracy and robustness even under significant distribution shifts. The results
highlight its superior efficiency and adaptability in both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution scenarios.

### [844] [PHASE: Physics-Integrated, Heterogeneity-Aware Surrogates for Scientific Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23453)
*Dawei Gao,Dali Wang,Zhuowei Gu,Qinglei Cao,Xiao Wang,Peter Thornton,Dan Ricciuto,Yunhe Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHASE is a deep-learning framework for accelerating scientific simulations by integrating physics-aware constraints and handling heterogeneous data, validated through its application to Earth system modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific simulations are computationally expensive, and existing AI surrogates face challenges in adoption due to issues like physical accuracy, trustworthiness, and handling diverse data types.

Method: PHASE employs modular deep-learning that utilizes data-specific encoders and multi-layered physics-based constraints to ensure consistency across local dynamics and global models.

Result: PHASE successfully accelerated a key Earth system modeling task, reducing simulation time by at least 60x with strong generalization to higher resolutions and validation of its physical consistency.

Conclusion: PHASE offers a practical and physically consistent AI-driven pathway for accelerating complex scientific simulations, ensuring trustworthiness and generalizability across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Large-scale numerical simulations underpin modern scientific discovery but
remain constrained by prohibitive computational costs. AI surrogates offer
acceleration, yet adoption in mission-critical settings is limited by concerns
over physical plausibility, trustworthiness, and the fusion of heterogeneous
data. We introduce PHASE, a modular deep-learning framework for
physics-integrated, heterogeneity-aware surrogates in scientific simulations.
PHASE combines data-type-aware encoders for heterogeneous inputs with
multi-level physics-based constraints that promote consistency from local
dynamics to global system behavior. We validate PHASE on the biogeochemical
(BGC) spin-up workflow of the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth
System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM), presenting-to our knowledge-the first
scientifically validated AI-accelerated solution for this task. Using only the
first 20 simulation years, PHASE infers a near-equilibrium state that otherwise
requires more than 1,200 years of integration, yielding an effective reduction
in required integration length by at least 60x. The framework is enabled by a
pipeline for fusing heterogeneous scientific data and demonstrates strong
generalization to higher spatial resolutions with minimal fine-tuning. These
results indicate that PHASE captures governing physical regularities rather
than surface correlations, enabling practical, physically consistent
acceleration of land-surface modeling and other complex scientific workflows.

*Alakh Sharma,Gaurish Trivedi,Kartikey Bhandari,Yash Sinha,Dhruv Kumar,Pratik Narang,Jagat Sesh Challa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GEMS offers a scalable approach to multi-agent reinforcement learning, eliminating inefficiencies of traditional methods like PSRO by using latent anchors and rollouts instead of explicit policy populations and payoff matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational and memory inefficiencies of existing population-based MARL methods like PSRO to improve scalability.

Method: GEMS uses latent anchors and an amortized generator with Monte Carlo rollouts and adaptive strategies such as trust-region objective training for best responses.

Result: GEMS demonstrated up to ~6x faster training, 1.3x less memory usage compared to PSRO, along with improved rewards across various tested environments.

Conclusion: GEMS preserves game theoretic guarantees while enabling scalable and efficient multi-agent learning by overcoming PSRO's inefficiencies.

Abstract: Scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) remains a central
challenge for AI. Existing population-based methods, like Policy-Space Response
Oracles, PSRO, require storing explicit policy populations and constructing
full payoff matrices, incurring quadratic computation and linear memory costs.
We present Generative Evolutionary Meta-Solver (GEMS), a surrogate-free
framework that replaces explicit populations with a compact set of latent
anchors and a single amortized generator. Instead of exhaustively constructing
the payoff matrix, GEMS relies on unbiased Monte Carlo rollouts,
multiplicative-weights meta-dynamics, and a model-free empirical-Bernstein UCB
oracle to adaptively expand the policy set. Best responses are trained within
the generator using an advantage-based trust-region objective, eliminating the
need to store and train separate actors. We evaluated GEMS in a variety of
Two-player and Multi-Player games such as the Deceptive Messages Game, Kuhn
Poker and Multi-Particle environment. We find that GEMS is up to ~6x faster,
has 1.3x less memory usage than PSRO, while also reaps higher rewards
simultaneously. These results demonstrate that GEMS retains the game theoretic
guarantees of PSRO, while overcoming its fundamental inefficiencies, hence
enabling scalable multi-agent learning in multiple domains.

*Rui Ai,Hugo De Oliveira Barbalho,Sirui Li,Alexei Robsky,David Simchi-Levi,Ishai Menache*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called Proximal Policy Optimization with Change Point Detection (POC) that balances performance and cost for deciding re-solving times for computationally intensive MILP optimization problems, outperforming baselines by 2%-17%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to optimize real-time decision-making processes in computationally intensive MILPs by addressing key challenges such as determining optimality and solving costs, detecting changes, and applying reinforcement learning to non-MDP structured systems without performance degradation.

Method: The proposed method integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Change Point Detection to determine when to re-solve MILPs, balancing performance and computational cost through a systematic framework.

Result: The POC framework consistently outperformed existing baselines by 2%-17% across eight synthetic and real-world datasets, offering an effective solution to the outlined challenges.

Conclusion: The study contributes by proposing POC as a robust strategy to address the economic trade-off in real-time MILP re-solving decisions and by introducing real-time benchmarks for evaluation.

Abstract: A common challenge in real-time operations is deciding whether to re-solve an
optimization problem or continue using an existing solution. While modern data
platforms may collect information at high frequencies, many real-time
operations require repeatedly solving computationally intensive optimization
problems formulated as Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). Determining when
to re-solve is, therefore, an economically important question. This problem
poses several challenges: 1) How to characterize solution optimality and
solving cost; 2) How to detect environmental changes and select beneficial
samples for solving the MILP; 3) Given the large time horizon and non-MDP
structure, vanilla reinforcement learning (RL) methods are not directly
applicable and tend to suffer from value function explosion. Existing
literature largely focuses on heuristics, low-data settings, and smooth
objectives, with little focus on common NP-hard MILPs. We propose a framework
called Proximal Policy Optimization with Change Point Detection (POC), which
systematically offers a solution for balancing performance and cost when
deciding appropriate re-solving times. Theoretically, we establish the
relationship between the number of re-solves and the re-solving cost. To test
our framework, we assemble eight synthetic and real-world datasets, and show
that POC consistently outperforms existing baselines by 2%-17%. As a side
benefit, our work fills the gap in the literature by introducing real-time MILP
benchmarks and evaluation criteria.

*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Drift-Adapter is a transformation layer allowing upgrades to embedding models without needing to rebuild ANN indexes, reducing recomputation costs and latency while maintaining retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many systems face disruption and high computational costs when updating embedding models due to full re-encoding and index rebuilding requirements.

Method: Drift-Adapter maps new embeddings to legacy embedding spaces using learnable transformation techniques like Orthogonal Procrustes, Low-Rank Affine, and Residual MLP, trained on paired embeddings.

Result: Experiments show Drift-Adapter recovers up to 99% retrieval recall while reducing recomputation costs by over 100 times, with negligible query latency impact.

Conclusion: Drift-Adapter offers a highly efficient and scalable solution for embedding model upgrades that minimizes operational disruption and computational overheads.

Abstract: Upgrading embedding models in production vector databases typically requires
re-encoding the entire corpus and rebuilding the Approximate Nearest Neighbor
(ANN) index, leading to significant operational disruption and computational
cost. This paper presents Drift-Adapter, a lightweight, learnable
transformation layer designed to bridge embedding spaces between model
versions. By mapping new queries into the legacy embedding space, Drift-Adapter
enables the continued use of the existing ANN index, effectively deferring full
re-computation. We systematically evaluate three adapter parameterizations:
Orthogonal Procrustes, Low-Rank Affine, and a compact Residual MLP, trained on
a small sample of paired old and new embeddings. Experiments on MTEB text
corpora and a CLIP image model upgrade (1M items) show that Drift-Adapter
recovers 95-99% of the retrieval recall (Recall@10, MRR) of a full
re-embedding, adding less than 10 microseconds of query latency. Compared to
operational strategies like full re-indexing or dual-index serving,
Drift-Adapter reduces recompute costs by over 100 times and facilitates
upgrades with near-zero operational interruption. We analyze robustness to
varied model drift, training data size, scalability to billion-item systems,
and the impact of design choices like diagonal scaling, demonstrating
Drift-Adapter's viability as a pragmatic solution for agile model deployment.

*Jiang-Xin Shi,Wen-Da Wei,Jin-Fei Qi,Xuanyu Chen,Tong Wei,Yu-Feng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces LoRAct, a memory-efficient fine-tuning method cutting activation memory by 80% compared to LoRA, addressing memory bottlenecks in parameter-efficient fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods encounter practical deployment challenges due to high memory overhead, particularly from model activations.

Method: LoRAct employs a novel online low-rank activation compression strategy and a sampling-based algorithm for orthogonal decomposition, optimizing memory usage without calibration data.

Result: LoRAct reduces activation memory usage by around 80% and shows competitive performance in vision and language tasks.

Conclusion: LoRAct provides an efficient alternative to existing methods, solving significant memory challenges while retaining model efficacy.

Abstract: The parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm has garnered significant
attention with the advancement of foundation models. Although numerous methods
have been proposed to reduce the number of trainable parameters, their
substantial memory overhead remains a critical bottleneck that hinders
practical deployment. In this paper, we observe that model activations
constitute a major source of memory consumption, especially under large batch
sizes and long context lengths; however, the rank of the activations remains
consistently low. Motivated by this insight, we propose a memory-efficient
fine-tuning approach Low-Rank Activation Compression (LoRAct). Unlike prior
work, LoRAct provides a more flexible and versatile compressing strategy that
can be applied online during the forward pass without the need for any
calibration data. Moreover, LoRAct incorporates a novel sampling-based
orthogonal decomposition algorithm specifically designed for low-rank matrices,
offering improved computational efficiency and a tighter error bound compared
to the widely used RSVD. Experiments on both vision and language tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRAct. Notably, LoRAct further reduces
activation memory by approximately 80% in comparison with the widely adopted
LoRA method, while maintaining competitive performance. The source code is

*Divyam Madaan,Sumit Chopra,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines whether ML models can generalize to future distributions using only past data, finding that simple baselines often outperform advanced methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Models often fail under distribution shifts, and this work aims to assess whether generalization to future data can be achieved using only past observations.

Method: Two approaches are explored: parameter interpolation (convex combinations) and parameter extrapolation (beyond convex hulls). These are benchmarked on diverse temporal tasks.

Result: Empirical results show that none of the advanced methods consistently outperform using the latest model parameters as a baseline.

Conclusion: The study reveals inherent challenges in anticipating future distributions without additional data or assumptions, advocating caution about claims of such generalization.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models often struggle to maintain performance under
distribution shifts, leading to inaccurate predictions on unseen future data.
In this work, we investigate whether and under what conditions models can
achieve such a generalization when relying solely on past data. We explore two
primary approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters
(\emph{parameter interpolation}) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex
hull of past parameters (\emph{parameter extrapolation}). We benchmark several
methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including
language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper
categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and
historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that
none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of
using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios. In the absence of
access to future data or robust assumptions about the underlying
data-generating process, these results underscore the inherent difficulties of
generalizing and extrapolating to future data and warrant caution when
evaluating claims of such generalization.

*Georgios Vlassis,Saleh Ashkboos,Alexandra Volkova,Torsten Hoefler,Dan Alistarh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study examines optimizer selection's effect on model robustness to quantization, proposing insights into post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a lack of systematic evidence on how optimizers interact with model quantization and seeks to pinpoint effective strategies for maintaining model performance under quantized settings.

Method: Researchers trained full-precision models using six distinct optimizers, evaluated PTQ effects, and conducted QAT comparisons. Metrics were analyzed, and scaling laws for QAT were derived.

Result: The study found that metrics like MMR and Kurtosis are inadequate predictors for PTQ performance. Shampoo emerged as the most effective optimizer for QAT, exhibiting minimal accuracy degradation and superior parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: Optimizer choice significantly influences post-training and quantization-aware training efficacy. Shampoo demonstrated robust performance, suggesting careful optimizer selection is crucial for efficient quantization.

Abstract: As new optimizers gain traction and model quantization becomes standard for
efficient deployment, a key question arises: how does the choice of optimizer
affect model performance in the presence of quantization? Despite progress in
both areas, systematic evidence on optimizer-quantization interactions remains
limited. To fill this gap, we study the impact of optimizer choice on model
robustness under quantization, considering both post-training quantization
(PTQ), and quantization-aware training (QAT). We first train full-precision
models, ranging from 50M to 1.5B parameters, with six optimizers, to explore
the hyperparameter landscape, and establish well-tuned baselines. We then apply
PTQ to evaluate how model performance degrades when trained with different
optimizers. We find that outlier-related metrics, such as the max-to-mean ratio
(MMR) and Kurtosis, fail to predict the PTQ performance across different
optimizers. We show analytically that this is due to the MMR capturing only
isolated layer errors, while ignoring how quantization errors accumulate and
propagate through the network. To study the QAT degradation, we train quantized
models from scratch and compare them to our original-precision baselines. We
find that optimizers performing well in the original pretraining setup may not
remain optimal under QAT, and that models trained with Shampoo show the lowest
accuracy degradation. Finally, we derive scaling laws for quantization-aware
training under different optimizers, showing that Shampoo achieves the highest
parameter efficiency of all tested optimizers.

*Yijie Zhang,Yiyang Shen,Weiran Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Information-disentangled Multimodal VAE (IDMVAE) to improve representation learning for multimodal data using advanced disentanglement techniques and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of extracting shared and private information from multimodal data, particularly in scenarios where current likelihood models fail to ensure effective disentanglement.

Method: The paper introduces IDMVAE, employing mutual information regularizations—cross-view mutual information maximization and cycle-consistency loss—to disentangle information. Additionally, diffusion models are incorporated to enhance latent prior capacity.

Result: IDMVAE achieves a clean separation of shared and private information and demonstrates improved generation quality and semantic coherence on challenging multimodal datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed IDMVAE effectively disentangles multimodal data, offering improved generation quality, and serves as a robust model for challenging datasets by leveraging complementary components like mutual information regularizations and diffusion models.

Abstract: Multimodal data are prevalent across various domains, and learning robust
representations of such data is paramount to enhancing generation quality and
downstream task performance. To handle heterogeneity and interconnections among
different modalities, recent multimodal generative models extract shared and
private (modality-specific) information with two separate variables. Despite
attempts to enforce disentanglement between these two variables, these methods
struggle with challenging datasets where the likelihood model is insufficient.
In this paper, we propose Information-disentangled Multimodal VAE (IDMVAE) to
explicitly address this issue, with rigorous mutual information-based
regularizations, including cross-view mutual information maximization for
extracting shared variables, and a cycle-consistency style loss for redundancy
removal using generative augmentations. We further introduce diffusion models
to improve the capacity of latent priors. These newly proposed components are
complementary to each other. Compared to existing approaches, IDMVAE shows a
clean separation between shared and private information, demonstrating superior
generation quality and semantic coherence on challenging datasets.

*Md. Saiful Bari Siddiqui,Nowshin Tarannum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study presents AMR-EnsembleNet, an ensemble framework to predict antimicrobial resistance using both sequence-aware and feature-based modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges in predicting antimicrobial resistance using genomic data, particularly the limitations of existing machine learning models and data scarcity in this domain.

Method: The framework combines a lightweight 1D CNN to learn sequence motifs with XGBoost to capture non-local feature interactions, forming an ensemble approach.

Result: Achieved high performance in resistance prediction for multiple antibiotics, including MCC of 0.926 for Ciprofloxacin and Macro F1-score of 0.691 for Gentamicin.

Conclusion: The ensemble approach effectively combines sequential and feature-based learning, utilizing genetic signals in AMR genes and overcoming limitations of traditional models.

Abstract: Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a rapidly escalating global health crisis.
While genomic sequencing enables rapid prediction of resistance phenotypes,
current computational methods have limitations. Standard machine learning
models treat the genome as an unordered collection of features, ignoring the
sequential context of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). State-of-the-art
sequence models like Transformers are often too data-hungry and computationally
expensive for the moderately-sized datasets that are typical in this domain. To
address these challenges, we propose AMR-EnsembleNet, an ensemble framework
that synergistically combines sequence-based and feature-based learning. We
developed a lightweight, custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to
efficiently learn predictive sequence motifs from high-dimensional SNP data.
This sequence-aware model was ensembled with an XGBoost model, a powerful
gradient boosting system adept at capturing complex, non-local feature
interactions. We trained and evaluated our framework on a benchmark dataset of
809 E. coli strains, predicting resistance across four antibiotics with varying
class imbalance. Our 1D CNN-XGBoost ensemble consistently achieved top-tier
performance across all the antibiotics, reaching a Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) of 0.926 for Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and the highest Macro
F1-score of 0.691 for the challenging Gentamicin (GEN) AMR prediction. We also
show that our model consistently focuses on SNPs within well-known AMR genes
like fusA and parC, confirming it learns the correct genetic signals for
resistance. Our work demonstrates that fusing a sequence-aware 1D CNN with a
feature-based XGBoost model creates a powerful ensemble, overcoming the
limitations of using either an order-agnostic or a standalone sequence model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MosaCD, a method for learning causal structures more accurately by leveraging both CI tests and annotations from large language models (LLMs) while addressing their hallucination issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve causal discovery from observational data by addressing limitations in classical constraint-based methods, such as cascading errors due to imperfect CI tests.

Method: The authors propose MosaCD, which filters hallucinations from LLM annotations using shuffled queries and then propagates edge orientations based on a confidence-down strategy.

Result: MosaCD yields higher accuracy in constructing causal graphs compared to existing constraint-based methods, particularly on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: MosaCD enhances causal discovery by combining LLM insights and CI tests effectively, while reducing errors commonly associated with traditional methods.

Abstract: Learning causal structure from observational data is central to scientific
modeling and decision-making. Constraint-based methods aim to recover
conditional independence (CI) relations in a causal directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Classical approaches such as PC and subsequent methods orient
v-structures first and then propagate edge directions from these seeds,
assuming perfect CI tests and exhaustive search of separating subsets --
assumptions often violated in practice, leading to cascading errors in the
final graph. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) as
experts, prompting sets of nodes for edge directions, and could augment edge
orientation when assumptions are not met. However, such methods implicitly
assume perfect experts, which is unrealistic for hallucination-prone LLMs. We
propose MosaCD, a causal discovery method that propagates edges from a
high-confidence set of seeds derived from both CI tests and LLM annotations. To
filter hallucinations, we introduce shuffled queries that exploit LLMs'
positional bias, retaining only high-confidence seeds. We then apply a novel
confidence-down propagation strategy that orients the most reliable edges
first, and can be integrated with any skeleton-based discovery method. Across
multiple real-world graphs, MosaCD achieves higher accuracy in final graph
construction than existing constraint-based methods, largely due to the
improved reliability of initial seeds and robust propagation strategies.

TL;DR: This paper introduces EVO-LRP, an optimization method for enhancing the interpretability and clarity of Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) in Explainable AI (XAI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LRP methods rely on heuristic rule sets that lack optimization for clarity and alignment with model behavior, limiting interpretability.

Method: The authors propose EVO-LRP, which utilizes Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) to tune LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative interpretability metrics like faithfulness and sparseness.

Result: EVO-LRP achieves better interpretability metric performance, visual coherence, and sensitivity to class-specific features compared to traditional XAI methods.

Conclusion: Principled, task-specific optimization can systematically enhance attribution quality in XAI methods through approaches like EVO-LRP.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods help identify which image regions influence a
model's prediction, but often face a trade-off between detail and
interpretability. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) offers a model-aware
alternative. However, LRP implementations commonly rely on heuristic rule sets
that are not optimized for clarity or alignment with model behavior. We
introduce EVO-LRP, a method that applies Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (CMA-ES) to tune LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative
interpretability metrics, such as faithfulness or sparseness. EVO-LRP
outperforms traditional XAI approaches in both interpretability metric
performance and visual coherence, with strong sensitivity to class-specific
features. These findings demonstrate that attribution quality can be
systematically improved through principled, task-specific optimization.

TL;DR: Introduces SKETCHLORD, a method combining low-rank and diagonal estimation for linear operators, outperforming alternatives in accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing methods that only approximate either low-rank or diagonal components for high-dimensional linear operators.

Method: Combining low-rank and diagonal estimation into a single approach and formulating it as a convex optimization problem for scalability.

Result: Theoretically and empirically showed superior performance compared to sequential methods, with experiments validating accurate recovery on synthetic data.

Conclusion: SKETCHLORD is an effective scalable tool for approximating LoRD operators, suitable for applications demanding high-fidelity solutions such as deep learning Hessians.

Abstract: Many relevant machine learning and scientific computing tasks involve
high-dimensional linear operators accessible only via costly matrix-vector
products. In this context, recent advances in sketched methods have enabled the
construction of *either* low-rank *or* diagonal approximations from few
matrix-vector products. This provides great speedup and scalability, but
approximation errors arise due to the assumed simpler structure. This work
introduces SKETCHLORD, a method that simultaneously estimates both low-rank
*and* diagonal components, targeting the broader class of Low-Rank *plus*
Diagonal (LoRD) linear operators. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically
that this joint estimation is superior also to any sequential variant
(diagonal-then-low-rank or low-rank-then-diagonal). Then, we cast SKETCHLORD as
a convex optimization problem, leading to a scalable algorithm. Comprehensive
experiments on synthetic (approximate) LoRD matrices confirm SKETCHLORD's
performance in accurately recovering these structures. This positions it as a
valuable addition to the structured approximation toolkit, particularly when
high-fidelity approximations are desired for large-scale operators, such as the
deep learning Hessian.

### [856] [Toward a Holistic Approach to Continual Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23592)
*Hoang Phan,Sungmin Cha,Tung Lam Tran,Qi Lei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for continual learning that optimally merges models at pre-merging, merging, and post-merging stages to prevent catastrophic forgetting without relying on historical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual learning methods either face scalability issues with task-specific vectors or lose functional information when old data is inaccessible. The goal is to provide an efficient and scalable method to handle these challenges.

Method: The framework fine-tunes the main model in its tangent space to reduce across-task interference, uses optimizer states during merging to retain functional information, and applies post-merging corrections to mitigate biases and align representations, all with constant memory usage.

Result: Experiments on class-incremental and domain-incremental benchmarks show competitive performance, effectively addressing catastrophic forgetting while operating within memory constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed continual model merging framework offers an effective and scalable solution to catastrophic forgetting by leveraging functional information and representation corrections across model stages without needing historical data.

Abstract: We present a holistic framework for continual model merging that intervenes
at three critical stages: pre-merging, during merging, and post-merging-to
address two fundamental challenges in continual learning. In particular,
conventional approaches either maintain a growing list of per-domain task
vectors, leading to scalability issues or rely solely on weight-space merging
when old data is inaccessible, thereby losing crucial functional information.
Our method overcomes these limitations by first fine-tuning the main model
within its tangent space on domain-specific data; this linearization amplifies
per-task weight disentanglement, effectively mitigating across-task
interference. During merging, we leverage functional information from available
optimizer states beyond mere parameter averages to avoid the need to revisit
old data. Finally, a post-merging correction aligns the representation
discrepancy between pre- and post-merged models, reducing bias and enhancing
overall performance-all while operating under constant memory constraints
without accessing historical data. Extensive experiments on standard

approach not only achieves competitive performance but also provides a scalable
and efficient solution to the catastrophic forgetting problem.

### [857] [Avoid Catastrophic Forgetting with Rank-1 Fisher from Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23593)
*Zekun Wang,Anant Gupta,Zihan Dong,Christopher J. MacLellan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method of minimizing catastrophic forgetting in continual learning using diffusion models, combining rank-1 Fisher optimization with replay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting is a key challenge in neural model continual learning, with existing solutions (replay, EWC) having specific limitations such as distributional drift and inaccurate assumptions about task optima.

Method: The paper proposes a rank-1 variant of EWC leveraging the gradient geometry of diffusion models and combines it with replay-based techniques to control parameter sharing while addressing drift.

Result: The suggested method improved FID scores and significantly reduced forgetting across class-incremental datasets (e.g., nearly eliminating forgetting in MNIST/FashionMNIST and halving it in ImageNet-1k).

Conclusion: Diffusion models under low SNR regimes yield rank-1 Fisher approximations, enabling an effective combination of rank-1 EWC and replay for continual learning.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central obstacle for continual learning in
neural models. Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation
(EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to
distributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across
tasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we
study the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce
high-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that,
in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become
strongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and
aligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1
variant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the
dominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach
to encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On
class-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10,
ImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces
forgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines. In particular,
forgetting is nearly eliminated on MNIST and FashionMNIST and is roughly halved
on ImageNet-1k. These results suggest that diffusion models admit an
approximately rank-1 Fisher. With a better Fisher estimate, EWC becomes a
strong complement to replay: replay encourages parameter sharing across tasks,
while EWC effectively constrains replay-induced drift.

*Zheng Wang,Kaixuan Zhang,Wanfang Chen,Xiaonan Lu,Longyuan Li,Tobias Schlagenhauf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyses linear models for time series forecasting and introduces solutions to address noise-related challenges using rank reduction techniques and a novel Root Purge method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the robustness and interpretability of simple linear models in time series forecasting and understand how these models outperform complex alternatives.

Method: The authors explore the role of characteristic roots in temporal dynamics, analyze linear models in both noise-free and noisy settings, and propose rank reduction techniques and a novel adaptive Root Purge approach.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, achieving competitive and state-of-the-art performance compared to existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: Integrating classical linear system theories with modern techniques enhances robustness, interpretability, and data efficiency in forecasting models.

Abstract: Time series forecasting remains a critical challenge across numerous domains,
yet the effectiveness of complex models often varies unpredictably across
datasets. Recent studies highlight the surprising competitiveness of simple
linear models, suggesting that their robustness and interpretability warrant
deeper theoretical investigation. This paper presents a systematic study of
linear models for time series forecasting, with a focus on the role of
characteristic roots in temporal dynamics. We begin by analyzing the noise-free
setting, where we show that characteristic roots govern long-term behavior and
explain how design choices such as instance normalization and channel
independence affect model capabilities. We then extend our analysis to the
noisy regime, revealing that models tend to produce spurious roots. This leads
to the identification of a key data-scaling property: mitigating the influence
of noise requires disproportionately large training data, highlighting the need
for structural regularization. To address these challenges, we propose two
complementary strategies for robust root restructuring. The first uses rank
reduction techniques, including Reduced-Rank Regression and Direct Weight Rank
Reduction, to recover the low-dimensional latent dynamics. The second, a novel
adaptive method called Root Purge, encourages the model to learn a
noise-suppressing null space during training. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches, validating our
theoretical insights and achieving state-of-the-art results in several
settings. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating classical
theories for linear systems with modern learning techniques to build robust,
interpretable, and data-efficient forecasting models.

### [859] [GraphIFE: Rethinking Graph Imbalance Node Classification via Invariant Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23616)
*Fanlong Zeng,Wensheng Gan,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the class imbalance problem in graph-structured data and proposes a novel framework, GraphIFE, incorporating graph invariant learning for better handling of imbalanced data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the challenge posed by the class imbalance problem in graph-structured data, where minority classes are underrepresented and existing graph neural networks fail to account for this imbalance.

Method: The proposed method, GraphIFE, mitigates quality inconsistency in synthesized nodes by introducing graph invariant feature extraction and enhancing embedding space representation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that GraphIFE consistently outperforms baseline methods across multiple datasets, showcasing its efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: GraphIFE improves the ability of graph neural networks to handle class imbalances by addressing quality inconsistencies in synthesized nodes, providing a more generalizable solution.

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the disproportionate distribution of
samples across different classes within a dataset, where the minority classes
are significantly underrepresented. This issue is also prevalent in
graph-structured data. Most graph neural networks (GNNs) implicitly assume a
balanced class distribution and therefore often fail to account for the
challenges introduced by class imbalance, which can lead to biased learning and
degraded performance on minority classes. We identify a quality inconsistency
problem in synthesized nodes, which leads to suboptimal performance under graph
imbalance conditions. To mitigate this issue, we propose GraphIFE (Graph
Invariant Feature Extraction), a novel framework designed to mitigate quality
inconsistency in synthesized nodes. Our approach incorporates two key concepts
from graph invariant learning and introduces strategies to strengthen the
embedding space representation, thereby enhancing the model's ability to
identify invariant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's
efficiency and robust generalization, as GraphIFE consistently outperforms
various baselines across multiple datasets. The code is publicly available at

*Chen Yang,Changhao Zhao,Chen Wang,Jiansheng Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses OOD generalization challenges in inductive kriging and introduces DRIK, a robust approach achieving better performance on spatio-temporal datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional setups for inductive kriging often experience information leakage and struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.

Method: The paper proposes a 3x3 spatio-temporal partitioning framework to separate training, validation, and test sets cleanly, and introduces DRIK, which employs node perturbations, edge reductions, and pseudo-labeled subgraphs for robust OOD generalization.

Result: Experiments using six diverse datasets demonstrate DRIK's consistent superior performance, achieving up to 12.48% lower mean absolute error and excellent scalability.

Conclusion: DRIK effectively addresses OOD generalization issues in inductive kriging, providing a structured and scalable solution applicable to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Inductive kriging supports high-resolution spatio-temporal estimation with
sparse sensor networks, but conventional training-evaluation setups often
suffer from information leakage and poor out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. We find that the common 2x2 spatio-temporal split allows test
data to influence model selection through early stopping, obscuring the true
OOD characteristics of inductive kriging. To address this issue, we propose a
3x3 partition that cleanly separates training, validation, and test sets,
eliminating leakage and better reflecting real-world applications. Building on
this redefined setting, we introduce DRIK, a Distribution-Robust Inductive
Kriging approach designed with the intrinsic properties of inductive kriging in
mind to explicitly enhance OOD generalization, employing a three-tier strategy
at the node, edge, and subgraph levels. DRIK perturbs node coordinates to
capture continuous spatial relationships, drops edges to reduce ambiguity in
information flow and increase topological diversity, and adds pseudo-labeled
subgraphs to strengthen domain generalization. Experiments on six diverse
spatio-temporal datasets show that DRIK consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving up to 12.48% lower MAE while maintaining strong scalability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixture-of-Experts models experience bottlenecks due to latency in PCIe transfers and inefficient memory handling during deployment on commodity hardware.

Method: PreScope introduces three innovations: LLaPor for accurate expert activation prediction, PreSched for optimized cross-layer scheduling, and AsyncIO for decoupling computation from I/O tasks.

Result: PreScope shows 141% higher throughput and 74.6% lower latency compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: PreScope effectively tackles hardware-related limitations in deploying MoE models, improving efficiency and performance significantly in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models face memory and PCIe latency bottlenecks when
deployed on commodity hardware. Offloading expert weights to CPU memory results
in PCIe transfer latency that exceeds GPU computation by several folds. We
present PreScope, a prediction-driven expert scheduling system that addresses
three key challenges: inaccurate activation prediction, PCIe bandwidth
competition, and cross-device scheduling complexity. Our solution includes: 1)
Learnable Layer-Aware Predictor (LLaPor) that captures layer-specific expert
activation patterns; 2) Prefetch-Aware Cross-Layer Scheduling (PreSched) that
generates globally optimal plans balancing prefetching costs and loading
overhead; 3) Asynchronous I/O Optimizer (AsyncIO) that decouples I/O from
computation, eliminating waiting bubbles. PreScope achieves 141% higher
throughput and 74.6% lower latency than state-of-the-art solutions.

*Ranhui Yan,Jia cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel model, VN-HGCN, which incorporates virtual nodes into heterogeneous graphs to enhance long-range information aggregation, achieving superior performance with fewer layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HGNNs face challenges with capturing long-range dependencies in heterogeneous graphs, often requiring many layers that lead to increased computational costs and over-smoothing.

Method: The VN-HGCN model introduces virtual nodes that act as auxiliary nodes connected to all nodes of a specific type in the graph, improving long-range information aggregation using only 4 layers.

Result: Experiments on three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets show that VN-HGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: VN-HGCN provides an efficient and generalizable solution to overcome the limitations of existing HGNNs by facilitating long-range information aggregation while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have exhibited powerful
performance in heterogeneous graph learning by aggregating information from
various types of nodes and edges. However, existing heterogeneous graph models
often struggle to capture long-range information or necessitate stacking
numerous layers to learn such dependencies, resulting in high computational
complexity and encountering over-smoothing issues. In this paper, we propose a
Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (VN-HGCN), which
leverages virtual nodes to facilitate enhanced information flow within the
graph. Virtual nodes are auxiliary nodes interconnected with all nodes of a
specific type in the graph, facilitating efficient aggregation of long-range
information across different types of nodes and edges. By incorporating virtual
nodes into the graph structure, VN-HGCN achieves effective information
aggregation with only $4$ layers. Additionally, we demonstrate that VN-HGCN can
serve as a versatile framework that can be seamlessly applied to other HGNN
models, showcasing its generalizability. Empirical evaluations validate the
effectiveness of VN-HGCN, and extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our
model over several state-of-the-art baselines.

*Fanlong Zeng,Wensheng Gan,Jiayang Wu,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses class imbalance in graph neural networks (GNNs), introduces the Randomness Anomalous Connectivity Problem (RACP), and proposes the Pure Node Sampling (PNS) method as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in graph-structured data, alongside the issue of performance degradation caused by random seeds in existing GNN models, has been overlooked in prior studies.

Method: The authors propose Pure Node Sampling (PNS), a plug-and-play module that operates during the node synthesis stage to counteract RACP and address class imbalance in GNNs.

Result: Experimental results show PNS effectively mitigates the effects of random seeds and outperforms baseline methods across diverse benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: PNS improves stability and performance in handling class imbalance and randomness-related issues within GNNs, offering a robust and general solution.

Abstract: The problem of class imbalance refers to an uneven distribution of quantity
among classes in a dataset, where some classes are significantly
underrepresented compared to others. Class imbalance is also prevalent in
graph-structured data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are typically based on the
assumption of class balance, often overlooking the issue of class imbalance. In
our investigation, we identified a problem, which we term the Randomness
Anomalous Connectivity Problem (RACP), where certain off-the-shelf models are
affected by random seeds, leading to a significant performance degradation. To
eliminate the influence of random factors in algorithms, we proposed PNS (Pure
Node Sampling) to address the RACP in the node synthesis stage. Unlike existing
approaches that design specialized algorithms to handle either quantity
imbalance or topological imbalance, PNS is a novel plug-and-play module that
operates directly during node synthesis to mitigate RACP. Moreover, PNS also
alleviates performance degradation caused by abnormal distribution of node
neighbors. We conduct a series of experiments to identify what factors are
influenced by random seeds. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
and stability of our method, which not only eliminates the effect of
unfavorable random seeds but also outperforms the baseline across various
benchmark datasets with different GNN backbones. Data and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-hoc calibration methods are widely used but lack comprehensive theoretical understanding, particularly regarding their performance across datasets, model architectures, and the influence of feature quality.

Method: A theoretical and empirical analysis of Platt scaling and isotonic regression, including convergence guarantees, computational bounds, and synthetic experiments focusing on feature informativeness.

Result: The study demonstrates consistent calibration improvements across diverse datasets and model architectures, with insights into calibration robustness under varying feature conditions.

Conclusion: The paper offers practical guidelines for selecting calibration methods based on dataset and computational constraints, enhancing the bridge between theory and practical implementation in uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Post-hoc calibration methods are widely used to improve the reliability of
probabilistic predictions from machine learning models. Despite their
prevalence, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these methods remains
elusive, particularly regarding their performance across different datasets and
model architectures. Input features play a crucial role in shaping model
predictions and, consequently, their calibration. However, the interplay
between feature quality and calibration performance has not been thoroughly
investigated. In this work, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of
post-hoc calibration methods, focusing on Platt scaling and isotonic
regression. We derive convergence guarantees, computational complexity bounds,
and finite-sample performance metrics for these methods. Furthermore, we
explore the impact of feature informativeness on calibration performance
through controlled synthetic experiments. Our empirical evaluation spans a
diverse set of real-world datasets and model architectures, demonstrating
consistent improvements in calibration metrics across various scenarios. By
examining calibration performance under varying feature conditions utilizing
only informative features versus complete feature spaces including noise
dimensions, we provide fundamental insights into the robustness and reliability
of different calibration approaches. Our findings offer practical guidelines
for selecting appropriate calibration methods based on dataset characteristics
and computational constraints, bridging the gap between theoretical
understanding and practical implementation in uncertainty quantification. Code

*Divya Jyoti Bajpai,Manjesh Kumar Hanawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces UAT, a method to adapt early exit thresholds in deep neural networks using a Multi-Armed Bandit framework, enhancing efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing early-exit strategies for deep neural networks rely on static confidence thresholds for exit decisions, resulting in overconfidence in wrong predictions and lack of robustness under distribution shifts.

Method: UAT employs a Multi-Armed Bandit framework with a novel reward function to dynamically and unsupervisedly adjust exit thresholds during online inference, balancing predictive certainty and reliability.

Result: UAT achieves 1.70-2.10x computational speedup with less than 2% performance degradation across tasks like vision-language understanding, text generation, and classification.

Conclusion: The proposed UAT framework effectively enhances computational efficiency and adaptiveness in deep neural networks, achieving significant speedup with minimal accuracy trade-offs.

Abstract: Early-Exit Deep Neural Networks enable adaptive inference by allowing
prediction at intermediary layers, significantly reducing computational costs
and latency. Most of the early exit strategies greedily exit a sample at an
intermediary layer if the confidence in class prediction exceeds a predefined
threshold that is set using a static validation set. This is problematic as the
model might be overconfident in a wrong class. Also, they are not robust to
distribution shifts encountered in deployment, which can undermine model
trustworthiness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose UAT that
adapts the threshold for exit decisions using a Multi-Armed Bandit framework,
enabling online, unsupervised adjustment of exit decisions. UAT makes decisions
based on a new reward function that assesses predictive certainty and its
reliability to balance computational efficiency and prediction quality while
penalizing unnecessary late exits. We provide guarantees on risk achieved by
UAT and validate its performance on diverse tasks spanning vision-language
understanding, text generation, and classification. Our framework demonstrates
consistent improvements in speedup (1.70-2.10x) with a minimal performance drop
(<2%) as compared to full model performance. Our source code is available at

### [866] [Why Alignment Must Precede Distillation: A Minimal Working Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23667)
*Sungmin Cha,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques the prevalent practice of aligning preferences on compact, knowledge-distilled models, asserting that this limits the ability to recall rare desirable behaviors. It instead proposes reversing the workflow: conducting alignment prior to distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in model preference alignment, especially in rare behaviors, by reconsidering the workflow order of alignment and knowledge distillation.

Method: The authors conducted theoretical analysis, controllable experiments using a Mixture-of-Gaussians setup, and empirical evaluations with the SmolLM2 language model family.

Result: Reversing the pipeline (Align -> KD) effectively aligns rare target behaviors, improves reward and precision metrics, and reduces performance variance compared to the standard workflow.

Conclusion: The study establishes the importance of conducting alignment before distillation, emphasizing reference model recall as a critical design choice for effective alignment.

Abstract: For efficiency, preference alignment is often performed on compact,
knowledge-distilled (KD) models. We argue this common practice introduces a
significant limitation by overlooking a key property of the alignment's
reference model: its distributional recall. We show that the standard KD ->
Align workflow diminishes the model's capacity to align rare yet desirable
behaviors, even under strong preference signals. We instead demonstrate that
reversing the pipeline (i.e., Align -> KD) is essential: alignment must first
be performed on a high-recall reference before distillation. Our contributions
are threefold. First, we provide a minimal working explanation of how the
reference model constrains preference alignment objectives at a fundamental
level. Second, we validate this theory in a controllable Mixture-of-Gaussians
experiment, where low-recall anchoring consistently results in suboptimal model
performance. Finally, we demonstrate that the same phenomenon holds in LLM
alignment with the SmolLM2 family: models aligned after KD fail to effectively
align target behaviors, resulting in substantially lower reward and target
precision. In contrast, our proposed Align -> KD pipeline robustly aligns these
behaviors, yielding models with superior target-oriented metrics and lower
variance. Together, these results establish reference-model recall as a
first-order design choice in alignment, offering a clear principle: alignment
must precede distillation.

TL;DR: The Clebsch-Gordan Transformer introduces an efficient global attention mechanism leveraging equivariant modeling on SO(3) representations, reducing computational complexity while enhancing performance across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of existing global attention mechanisms and equivariant transformer models, which limits their expressiveness and performance due to high costs.

Method: The paper introduces Clebsch-Gordan Convolution on SO(3) irreducible representations, achieving efficient equivariant modeling with O(N log N) input complexity, and incorporates sparsity exploitation and optional token permutation equivariance features.

Result: The proposed method delivers improved GPU memory usage, faster computation, and enhanced accuracy across physical, biochemical, computer vision, and robotics benchmarks.

Conclusion: Clebsch-Gordan Transformer provides a scalable and computationally efficient approach for high-order equivariant feature modeling, enhancing transformer functionality in diverse scientific and engineering domains.

Abstract: The global attention mechanism is one of the keys to the success of
transformer architecture, but it incurs quadratic computational costs in
relation to the number of tokens. On the other hand, equivariant models, which
leverage the underlying geometric structures of problem instance, often achieve
superior accuracy in physical, biochemical, computer vision, and robotic tasks,
at the cost of additional compute requirements. As a result, existing
equivariant transformers only support low-order equivariant features and local
context windows, limiting their expressiveness and performance. This work
proposes Clebsch-Gordan Transformer, achieving efficient global attention by a
novel Clebsch-Gordon Convolution on $\SO(3)$ irreducible representations. Our
method enables equivariant modeling of features at all orders while achieving
${O}(N \log N)$ input token complexity. Additionally, the proposed method
scales well with high-order irreducible features, by exploiting the sparsity of
the Clebsch-Gordon matrix. Lastly, we also incorporate optional token
permutation equivariance through either weight sharing or data augmentation. We
benchmark our method on a diverse set of benchmarks including n-body
simulation, QM9, ModelNet point cloud classification and a robotic grasping
dataset, showing clear gains over existing equivariant transformers in GPU
memory size, speed, and accuracy.

TL;DR: Hermes is a novel framework using hypergraph networks to improve stock time series forecasting by effectively exploiting industry correlations, addressing limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current forecasting methods inadequately account for inter-industry lead-lag interactions and multi-scale information within stock time series data.

Method: Hermes integrates moving aggregation and multi-scale fusion modules in hypergraph networks to capture lead-lag dependencies and multi-scale information efficiently.

Result: Hermes demonstrated superior accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches on real-world stock datasets.

Conclusion: The study validates Hermes as an effective and efficient tool for improving stock time series forecasting, addressing key shortcomings in existing methods.

Abstract: Time series forecasting occurs in a range of financial applications providing
essential decision-making support to investors, regulatory institutions, and
analysts. Unlike multivariate time series from other domains, stock time series
exhibit industry correlation. Exploiting this kind of correlation can improve
forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods based on hypergraphs can only
capture industry correlation relatively superficially. These methods face two
key limitations: they do not fully consider inter-industry lead-lag
interactions, and they do not model multi-scale information within and among
industries. This study proposes the Hermes framework for stock time series
forecasting that aims to improve the exploitation of industry correlation by
eliminating these limitations. The framework integrates moving aggregation and
multi-scale fusion modules in a hypergraph network. Specifically, to more
flexibly capture the lead-lag relationships among industries, Hermes proposes a
hyperedge-based moving aggregation module. This module incorporates a sliding
window and utilizes dynamic temporal aggregation operations to consider
lead-lag dependencies among industries. Additionally, to effectively model
multi-scale information, Hermes employs cross-scale, edge-to-edge message
passing to integrate information from different scales while maintaining the
consistency of each scale. Experimental results on multiple real-world stock
datasets show that Hermes outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multivariate time series forecasting by better modeling inter-variable dependencies while addressing redundancy in information aggregation and using predictions from different temporal scales.

Method: The authors propose DIMIGNN, which integrates a Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection Mechanism (DNSM) for effective neighbor selection and a Dynamic Multi-Scale Fusion Module (DMFM) to combine predictions from various temporal scales.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that DIMIGNN consistently outperforms previous methods in multivariate time series forecasting.

Conclusion: DIMIGNN provides a significant advancement in the field of multivariate time series forecasting by introducing mechanisms for diverse neighbor selection and multi-scale prediction fusion, leading to improved forecasting accuracy.

Abstract: Recently, numerous deep models have been proposed to enhance the performance
of multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Among them, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs)-based methods have shown great potential due to their
capability to explicitly model inter-variable dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook the diversity of information among neighbors, which may
lead to redundant information aggregation. In addition, their final prediction
typically relies solely on the representation from a single temporal scale. To
tackle these issues, we propose a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with
Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection and Dynamic Multi-scale Fusion (DIMIGNN).
DIMIGNN introduces a Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection Mechanism (DNSM) to
ensure that each variable shares high informational similarity with its
neighbors while maintaining diversity among neighbors themselves. Furthermore,
a Dynamic Multi-Scale Fusion Module (DMFM) is introduced to dynamically adjust
the contributions of prediction results from different temporal scales to the
final forecasting result. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that DIMIGNN consistently outperforms prior methods.

TL;DR: This paper investigates mixture-of-experts (MoE) scaling laws to identify optimal configurations for model performance, using controlled experiments and deriving theoretical and practical insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in determining scaling laws specific to MoE models, which are critical for parameter-efficient and cost-effective scaling in large language models.

Method: The study decomposes MoE settings into key factors and conducts 446 controlled experiments to ascertain their individual and combined impacts on model performance, leading to the creation of a joint scaling law.

Result: The analysis uncovered optimal settings for key MoE parameters, revealing the independence of certain configurations from model architecture or data size, and a trend toward sparser activation parameter ratios with model scaling.

Conclusion: The proposed MoE scaling law offers precise guidance for designing and training MoE models, facilitating improved performance and efficiency in future implementations.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become the consensus approach for
enabling parameter-efficient scaling and cost-effective deployment in large
language models. However, existing scaling laws for dense models are
inapplicable to MoE models, which stems from three critical challenges: the
multiplicity of influencing factors, their intricate coupling relationships and
the non-monotonic nature of their performance impacts. They collectively
necessitate a fine-grained investigation into MoE-specific scaling laws. In
this work, we perform a systematic decomposition of MoE settings, identifying
five key factors that influence model performance from both size and structural
perspectives (data size ($D$), total model size ($N$), activated model size
($N_a$), number of active experts ($G$) and the ratio of shared experts ($S$)).
Specifically, we design $446$ controlled experiments to characterize their
marginal effects, ultimately constructing a comprehensive and precise joint MoE
scaling law that considers all essential factors. Furthermore, we derive the
theoretically optimal and practically efficiency-aware optimal configurations
for $G$, $S$ and $N_a/N$ with detailed analyses. Our results demonstrate that
the optimal settings for $G$ and $S$ are independent of both the model
architecture and data size. With the scaling of $N$, the optimal activation
parameter ratio of $N_a/N$ becomes sparser. Our proposed MoE scaling law could
function as an accurate and insightful guidance to facilitate future MoE model
design and training.

Motivation: Existing approaches in FCL struggle with catastrophic forgetting due to evolving tasks and data distributions, as well as ineffective knowledge aggregation that fails to enhance client performance.

Method: The authors introduce a dynamic cooperation framework where clients form coalitions based on selective cooperation and benefit assessment through gradient coherence and model similarity measures.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method outperforms various baselines in improving client model performance while ensuring effective learning and knowledge retention.

Conclusion: Dynamic coalition formation enables decentralized FCL to balance new knowledge acquisition and retention, providing personalized models and mitigating catastrophic forgetting effectively.

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) has garnered increasing attention for its
ability to support distributed computation in environments with evolving data
distributions. However, the emergence of new tasks introduces both temporal and
cross-client shifts, making catastrophic forgetting a critical challenge. Most
existing works aggregate knowledge from clients into a global model, which may
not enhance client performance since irrelevant knowledge could introduce
interference, especially in heterogeneous scenarios. Additionally, directly
applying decentralized approaches to FCL suffers from ineffective group
formation caused by task changes. To address these challenges, we propose a
decentralized dynamic cooperation framework for FCL, where clients establish
dynamic cooperative learning coalitions to balance the acquisition of new
knowledge and the retention of prior learning, thereby obtaining personalized
models. To maximize model performance, each client engages in selective
cooperation, dynamically allying with others who offer meaningful performance
gains. This results in non-overlapping, variable coalitions at each stage of
the task. Moreover, we use coalitional affinity game to simulate coalition
relationships between clients. By assessing both client gradient coherence and
model similarity, we quantify the client benefits derived from cooperation. We
also propose a merge-blocking algorithm and a dynamic cooperative evolution
algorithm to achieve cooperative and dynamic equilibrium. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to various
baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/ydn3229/DCFCL.

*Tanya Chowdhury,Atharva Nijasure,Yair Zick,James Allan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework using coalitional game theory to analyze how neurons cooperate within LLM layers during fine-tuning, identifying synergistic coalitions for improved interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the unclear nature of task-specific representations in fine-tuned LLMs, particularly in MLP layers, and the need to understand neuron cooperation beyond isolated behaviors.

Method: The authors introduce a mechanistic interpretability approach based on hedonic game theory, where neurons are treated as agents forming stable coalitions that capture their group-level dynamics.

Result: The method uncovers neuron coalitions with higher synergy and functional importance compared to traditional clustering approaches, demonstrating their persistence and transitions across layers.

Conclusion: Hedonic coalitions provide insights into the cooperative behavior of neurons in LLMs, enabling interpretable and predictive computational units applicable across different domains.

Abstract: Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) encode rich task-specific features,
but the form of these representations, especially within MLP layers, remains
unclear. Empirical inspection of LoRA updates shows that new features
concentrate in mid-layer MLPs, yet the scale of these layers obscures
meaningful structure. Prior probing suggests that statistical priors may
strengthen, split, or vanish across depth, motivating the need to study how
neurons work together rather than in isolation.
  We introduce a mechanistic interpretability framework based on coalitional
game theory, where neurons mimic agents in a hedonic game whose preferences
capture their synergistic contributions to layer-local computations. Using
top-responsive utilities and the PAC-Top-Cover algorithm, we extract stable
coalitions of neurons: groups whose joint ablation has non-additive effects. We
then track their transitions across layers as persistence, splitting, merging,
or disappearance.
  Applied to LLaMA, Mistral, and Pythia rerankers fine-tuned on scalar IR
tasks, our method finds coalitions with consistently higher synergy than
clustering baselines. By revealing how neurons cooperate to encode features,
hedonic coalitions uncover higher-order structure beyond disentanglement and
yield computational units that are functionally important, interpretable, and
predictive across domains.

*Michael Drolet,Firas Al-Hafez,Aditya Bhatt,Jan Peters,Oleg Arenz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel training framework for discrete VAEs using natural gradients without reparameterization, enabling superior performance in reconstructing high-dimensional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete VAEs are promising for modeling compact and high bit-efficient latent spaces but face challenges due to limitations in gradient-based training methods, especially for high-dimensional tasks like image reconstruction.

Method: The authors introduce a training method using a non-parametric encoder with natural gradient optimization, combined with automatic step size adaptation and a transformer-based encoder.

Result: The proposed method scales to datasets like ImageNet and achieves significant improvements in reconstruction quality, with a 20% enhancement on FID Score for ImageNet 256 compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: This approach overcomes limitations of existing discrete VAE techniques and demonstrates its effectiveness in high-dimensional data tasks, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: Discrete latent bottlenecks in variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer high bit
efficiency and can be modeled with autoregressive discrete distributions,
enabling parameter-efficient multimodal search with transformers. However,
discrete random variables do not allow for exact differentiable
parameterization; therefore, discrete VAEs typically rely on approximations,
such as Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization or straight-through gradient
estimates, or employ high-variance gradient-free methods such as REINFORCE that
have had limited success on high-dimensional tasks such as image
reconstruction. Inspired by popular techniques in policy search, we propose a
training framework for discrete VAEs that leverages the natural gradient of a
non-parametric encoder to update the parametric encoder without requiring
reparameterization. Our method, combined with automatic step size adaptation
and a transformer-based encoder, scales to challenging datasets such as
ImageNet and outperforms both approximate reparameterization methods and
quantization-based discrete autoencoders in reconstructing high-dimensional
data from compact latent spaces, achieving a 20% improvement on FID Score for
ImageNet 256.

*Soroosh Safari Loaliyan,Jose-Luis Ambite,Paul M. Thompson,Neda Jahanshad,Greg Ver Steeg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses domain shift in Federated Learning by integrating Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks and proposes a proximal regularization method to improve generalization across unseen medical imaging sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle scanner-induced domain shift in Federated Learning for medical imaging, a problem aggravated by privacy constraints which prevent sharing of raw data across sites.

Method: The authors integrate a Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) within the Federated Learning framework and introduce a proximal regularization technique to stabilize adversarial training among clients.

Result: The proposed method showed improved cross-site generalization compared to FedAvg and ERM in experiments using T1-weighted 3D brain MRIs from the OpenBHB dataset, all while maintaining privacy.

Conclusion: The integration of a stabilized federated DANN demonstrates superior performance in addressing domain shift in medical imaging tasks, making it effective for privacy-conscious applications.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) trains models locally at each research center or
clinic and aggregates only model updates, making it a natural fit for medical
imaging, where strict privacy laws forbid raw data sharing. A major obstacle is
scanner-induced domain shift: non-biological variations in hardware or
acquisition protocols can cause models to fail on external sites. Most
harmonization methods correct this shift by directly comparing data across
sites, conflicting with FL's privacy constraints. Domain Generalization (DG)
offers a privacy-friendly alternative - learning site-invariant representations
without sharing raw data - but standard DG pipelines still assume centralized
access to multi-site data, again violating FL's guarantees. This paper meets
these difficulties with a straightforward integration of a Domain-Adversarial
Neural Network (DANN) within the FL process. After demonstrating that a naive
federated DANN fails to converge, we propose a proximal regularization method
that stabilizes adversarial training among clients. Experiments on T1-weighted
3-D brain MRIs from the OpenBHB dataset, performing brain-age prediction on
participants aged 6-64 y (mean 22+/-6 y; 45 percent male) in training and 6-79
y (mean 19+/-13 y; 55 percent male) in validation, show that training on 15
sites and testing on 19 unseen sites yields superior cross-site generalization
over FedAvg and ERM while preserving data privacy.

*Ankit Gangwal,Aaryan Ajay Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study investigates model merging (MM) in the context of black-box adversarial transferability attacks, revealing MM's inability to reliably defend against such attacks and offering insights to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of model merging (MM) on transfer attacks using adversarial examples, an area that has not been sufficiently studied despite MM's growing role in multi-task learning and adversarial robustness.

Method: The researchers conducted extensive evaluations across 8 MM methods, 7 datasets, and 6 attack methods, totaling 336 attack settings, and applied statistical analysis to assess MM's vulnerability to transfer attacks.

Result: The study challenges the assumption that MM provides inherent adversarial robustness, showing over 95% transfer attack success rate. It identifies that stronger MM methods and mitigating representation bias increase this vulnerability, and weight averaging is particularly susceptible.

Conclusion: The paper provides key insights into MM's vulnerabilities to transfer attacks and offers guidance for designing more robust and secure machine-learning systems that incorporate MM.

Abstract: Model Merging (MM) has emerged as a promising alternative to multi-task
learning, where multiple fine-tuned models are combined, without access to
tasks' training data, into a single model that maintains performance across
tasks. Recent works have explored the impact of MM on adversarial attacks,
particularly backdoor attacks. However, none of them have sufficiently explored
its impact on transfer attacks using adversarial examples, i.e., a black-box
adversarial attack where examples generated for a surrogate model successfully
mislead a target model.
  In this work, we study the effect of MM on the transferability of adversarial
examples. We perform comprehensive evaluations and statistical analysis
consisting of 8 MM methods, 7 datasets, and 6 attack methods, sweeping over 336
distinct attack settings. Through it, we first challenge the prevailing notion
of MM conferring free adversarial robustness, and show MM cannot reliably
defend against transfer attacks, with over 95% relative transfer attack success
rate. Moreover, we reveal 3 key insights for machine-learning practitioners
regarding MM and transferability for a robust system design: (1) stronger MM
methods increase vulnerability to transfer attacks; (2) mitigating
representation bias increases vulnerability to transfer attacks; and (3) weight
averaging, despite being the weakest MM method, is the most vulnerable MM
method to transfer attacks. Finally, we analyze the underlying reasons for this
increased vulnerability, and provide potential solutions to the problem. Our
findings offer critical insights for designing more secure systems employing
MM.

*Qingren Yao,Ming Jin,Chengqi Zhang,Chao-Han Huck Yang,Jun Qi,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TimeTic, a framework for estimating transferability of time series foundation models, facilitating efficient model selection for fine-tuning in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning TSFMs is crucial for domains with limited data, making it important to identify the best model for downstream tasks efficiently given the growing number of TSFMs.

Method: TimeTic organizes model-data relationships as contextual information through in-context learning. It uses tabular foundation models and introduces entropy evolution-based model characterization to generalize across diverse models.

Result: TimeTic achieves strong alignment in predicting performance on unseen datasets with a mean rank correlation of 0.6 and a 30% improvement over zero-shot performance as a transferability metric.

Conclusion: TimeTic demonstrates flexibility and effectiveness in estimating TSFM transferability and can aid in improving the efficiency of model selection for fine-tuning in time series forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) offer strong zero-shot forecasting via
large-scale pre-training, yet fine-tuning remains critical for boosting
performance in domains with limited public data. With the growing number of
TSFMs, efficiently identifying the best model for downstream fine-tuning
becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we introduce TimeTic, a
transferability estimation framework that recasts model selection as an
in-context-learning problem: given observations on known (source) datasets, it
predicts how a TSFM will perform after fine-tuning on a downstream (target)
dataset. TimeTic flexibly organizes the observed model-data relationships as
contextual information, allowing it to adapt seamlessly to various test-time
scenarios. Leveraging the natural tabular structure formed by dataset
meta-features, model characteristics, and fine-tuned performance, we employ
tabular foundation models to serve as in-context learners. We further introduce
a novel model characterization based on entropy evolution across model layers,
capturing embedding-space distinctions and enabling TimeTic to generalize
across arbitrary model sets. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for
transferability estimation including 10 datasets, 10 foundation models, and 3
forecasting tasks. On this benchmark, TimeTic's estimation demonstrates strong
alignment with actual fine-tuned performance for previously unseen datasets,
achieving a mean rank correlation of approximately 0.6 and a 30% improvement
compared to using zero-shot performance as the transferability score.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SAFDNet, a model designed to predict intraoperative hypotension (IOH) using advanced signal processing and attention mechanisms to enhance noise handling and capture dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IOH is associated with severe postoperative complications, and current prediction models struggle with noise sensitivity, and incorporating both time- and frequency-domain data effectively.

Method: The SAFDNet model uses an adaptive spectral block with Fourier analysis and self-adaptive thresholding for noise mitigation, coupled with an interactive attention block to capture data dependencies.

Result: SAFDNet achieved up to 97.3% AUROC in IOH prediction, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models in performance and robustness during internal and external validation on large datasets.

Conclusion: SAFDNet shows strong potential for clinical adoption due to its high predictive accuracy, robust performance, and ability to handle noisy biosignal data effectively.

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is strongly associated with postoperative
complications, including postoperative delirium and increased mortality, making
its early prediction crucial in perioperative care. While several artificial
intelligence-based models have been developed to provide IOH warnings, existing
methods face limitations in incorporating both time and frequency domain
information, capturing short- and long-term dependencies, and handling noise
sensitivity in biosignal data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Self-Adaptive Frequency Domain Network (SAFDNet). Specifically, SAFDNet
integrates an adaptive spectral block, which leverages Fourier analysis to
extract frequency-domain features and employs self-adaptive thresholding to
mitigate noise. Additionally, an interactive attention block is introduced to
capture both long-term and short-term dependencies in the data. Extensive
internal and external validations on two large-scale real-world datasets
demonstrate that SAFDNet achieves up to 97.3\% AUROC in IOH early warning,
outperforming state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, SAFDNet exhibits robust
predictive performance and low sensitivity to noise, making it well-suited for
practical clinical applications.

TL;DR: GBSK is a granular-ball-based clustering algorithm for large datasets that maintains performance while reducing computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of clustering large-scale datasets with efficient methods.

Method: Introduced GBSK and AGBSK leveraging granular-ball techniques and multi-sampling to uncover skeleton structures in data for scalable clustering.

Result: Experiments show high efficiency and clustering accuracy for datasets with up to 100 million instances across 256 dimensions.

Conclusion: GBSK and AGBSK are effective, efficient, and deployable tools for clustering in large-scale datasets.

Abstract: To effectively handle clustering task for large-scale datasets, we propose a
novel scalable skeleton clustering algorithm, namely GBSK, which leverages the
granular-ball technique to capture the underlying structure of data. By
multi-sampling the dataset and constructing multi-grained granular-balls, GBSK
progressively uncovers a statistical "skeleton" -- a spatial abstraction that
approximates the essential structure and distribution of the original data.
This strategy enables GBSK to dramatically reduce computational overhead while
maintaining high clustering accuracy. In addition, we introduce an adaptive
version, AGBSK, with simplified parameter settings to enhance usability and
facilitate deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted
on standard computing hardware demonstrate that GBSK achieves high efficiency
and strong clustering performance on large-scale datasets, including one with
up to 100 million instances across 256 dimensions. Our implementation and
experimental results are available at: https://github.com/XFastDataLab/GBSK/.

*Ting-Kang Wang,Chih-Pin Tan,Yi-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a mechanism called delay-based scheduling (DP) to improve symbolic music generation by balancing efficiency and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic music generation struggles with a trade-off between coherence and processing efficiency due to the choice of tokenization methods.

Method: The authors introduce a delay-based scheduling mechanism (DP) that decodes compound-like tokens across multiple steps to model intra-token dependencies without adding extra parameters.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the DP mechanism outperforms standard compound tokenizations in symbolic orchestral MIDI datasets while approaching the performance of fine-grained tokenizations.

Conclusion: DP is an effective and lightweight solution for improving efficiency and quality in symbolic music generation, offering a significant improvement without increasing complexity.

Abstract: Symbolic music generation faces a fundamental trade-off between efficiency
and quality. Fine-grained tokenizations achieve strong coherence but incur long
sequences and high complexity, while compact tokenizations improve efficiency
at the expense of intra-token dependencies. To address this, we adapt a
delay-based scheduling mechanism (DP) that expands compound-like tokens across
decoding steps, enabling autoregressive modeling of intra-token dependencies
while preserving efficiency. Notably, DP is a lightweight strategy that
introduces no additional parameters and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing representations. Experiments on symbolic orchestral MIDI datasets show
that our method improves all metrics over standard compound tokenizations and
narrows the gap to fine-grained tokenizations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses how Batch Normalization (BN), despite challenges in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), can be effectively adapted to stabilize and optimize training using a proposed method called Mode-Aware Batch Normalization (MA-BN).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the limited adoption of Batch Normalization (BN) in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) due to challenges like non-i.i.d. data and shifting distributions, while exploring its potential advantages in improving DRL performance.

Method: The authors conducted empirical studies of BN within off-policy actor-critic algorithms, analyzed failure modes causing instability, and proposed the Mode-Aware Batch Normalization (MA-BN) method to improve BN's robustness in DRL applications.

Result: The paper finds that MA-BN accelerates and stabilizes training in DRL, widens the effective learning rate range, enhances exploration capabilities, and mitigates optimization challenges.

Conclusion: MA-BN effectively addresses key issues with BN in DRL, making it a practical and valuable tool for stabilizing and improving the training process while yielding better overall performance in RL tasks.

Abstract: Batch Normalization (BN) has played a pivotal role in the success of deep
learning by improving training stability, mitigating overfitting, and enabling
more effective optimization. However, its adoption in deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) has been limited due to the inherent non-i.i.d. nature of data
and the dynamically shifting distributions induced by the agent's learning
process. In this paper, we argue that, despite these challenges, BN retains
unique advantages in DRL settings, particularly through its stochasticity and
its ability to ease training. When applied appropriately, BN can adapt to
evolving data distributions and enhance both convergence speed and final
performance. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the use
of BN in off-policy actor-critic algorithms, systematically analyzing how
different training and evaluation modes impact performance. We further identify
failure modes that lead to instability or divergence, analyze their underlying
causes, and propose the Mode-Aware Batch Normalization (MA-BN) method with
practical actionable recommendations for robust BN integration in DRL
pipelines. We also empirically validate that, in RL settings, MA-BN accelerates
and stabilizes training, broadens the effective learning rate range, enhances
exploration, and reduces overall optimization difficulty. Our code is available

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) for improving large language models, identifies its instability issue, and introduces Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT) to address this while maintaining performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which risks memorization, and reinforcement learning (RL), which requires higher computational costs but enhances generalization.

Method: Analyzed DFT using a reward-weighted regression framework and proposed ASFT by incorporating lightweight KL regularization to enhance stability while retaining performance benefits.

Result: ASFT consistently outperformed SFT and DFT in tasks ranging from mathematical reasoning and medical knowledge grounding to code generation, with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: Combining theoretical analysis with practical implementations through ASFT solves DFT's instability issues and achieves improved performance across tasks with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Post-training of large language models involves a fundamental trade-off
between supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which efficiently mimics demonstrations
but tends to memorize, and reinforcement learning (RL), which achieves better
generalization at higher computational cost. Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) recently
emerged as a promising middle ground, reweighting SFT objectives with token
probabilities and achieving improvements in certain reasoning domains, though
it exhibits instability in other tasks. We provide a analysis of DFT through
the reward-weighted regression (RWR) framework, revealing that it corresponds
to a specific auxiliary distribution choice that yields provably tighter RL
bounds than standard SFT. However, our analysis also uncovers a critical
limitation: this construction lacks distributional anchoring, leading to
progressive drift that undermines training stability. To address this, we
propose Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT), which augments DFT's
reweighting with lightweight KL regularization to preserve tightness while
ensuring stability. Empirically, ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT
across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code
generation, achieving substantial improvements with minimal computational
overhead. Our RWR framework provides a systematic lens for understanding
post-training methods and demonstrates that principled theoretical analysis
leads to both stronger guarantees and practical gains.

TL;DR: SHAPoint introduces a framework merging gradient boosted trees' accuracy with point-based risk score interpretability, excelling in clinical decision-making tasks across various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional point-based risk score methods in clinical settings lack flexibility and predictive power due to manual preprocessing, task-specific modeling, and restrictive assumptions.

Method: SHAPoint integrates gradient boosted trees and interpretable scoring, handling tasks like classification, regression, and survival, while utilizing tree-based features like missing data handling and monotonic constraints.

Result: SHAPoint achieves compact, interpretable, and accurate risk scores, comparable to top methods, but with reduced runtime and preprocessing requirements.

Conclusion: SHAPoint proves to be an efficient and transparent system for deriving risk scores, enhancing scalability and utility in various tasks.

Abstract: Interpretable risk scores play a vital role in clinical decision support, yet
traditional methods for deriving such scores often rely on manual
preprocessing, task-specific modeling, and simplified assumptions that limit
their flexibility and predictive power. We present SHAPoint, a novel,
task-agnostic framework that integrates the predictive accuracy of gradient
boosted trees with the interpretability of point-based risk scores. SHAPoint
supports classification, regression, and survival tasks, while also inheriting
valuable properties from tree-based models, such as native handling of missing
data and support for monotonic constraints. Compared to existing frameworks,
SHAPoint offers superior flexibility, reduced reliance on manual preprocessing,
and faster runtime performance. Empirical results show that SHAPoint produces
compact and interpretable scores with predictive performance comparable to
state-of-the-art methods, but at a fraction of the runtime, making it a
powerful tool for transparent and scalable risk stratification.

TL;DR: This paper explores the structural organization of knowledge in large language models (LLMs) and proposes a graph-based method to improve reasoning and knowledge injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the structural organization of LLM knowledge, akin to patterns seen in human cognition, and leverage this to enhance knowledge coverage and efficiency in tasks like QA and fact-checking.

Method: The researchers represent LLM knowledge as a graph and use a Graph Neural Network (GNN) regression model to predict knowledgeability scores, enabling prioritization of less-known triplets for labeling and analysis.

Result: The graph-based model effectively enhances the coverage and efficiency of active labeling, and improves multi-hop reasoning paths in question answering.

Conclusion: The study uncovers a homophily pattern in LLMs and demonstrates the practical benefits of graph-based modeling for knowledge organization and task improvements in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural
knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as
question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of
their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience
findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact
increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an
analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM
knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the
triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability
relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to
possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the
graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network
(GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for
triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted
knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets,
thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not
only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject
knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in
reasoning-intensive question answering.

TL;DR: This study investigates the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of Mamba, a state-space model (SSM) with linear complexity, focusing on its mechanisms for linear regression tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of theoretical understanding of Mamba's ICL capabilities, especially compared to Transformers, despite its demonstrated empirical strength in long-sequence modeling.

Method: The authors analyze Mamba's training dynamics in linear regression ICL tasks using novel techniques for tackling non-convex optimization with gradient descent, establishing convergence rates and deriving comparable loss bounds with Transformers.

Result: The study finds that Mamba achieves exponential convergence rates and performs a form of online gradient descent to adapt to latent functions in context, offering a mechanism distinct from that of Transformers.

Conclusion: Mamba demonstrates comparable theoretical performance to Transformers on ICL tasks, utilizing a different mechanism—online gradient descent—validating this result through experimental simulations.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, emerge as an efficient
Transformer alternative with linear complexity for long-sequence modeling.
Recent empirical works demonstrate Mamba's in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities competitive with Transformers, a critical capacity for large
foundation models. However, theoretical understanding of Mamba's ICL remains
limited, restricting deeper insights into its underlying mechanisms. Even
fundamental tasks such as linear regression ICL, widely studied as a standard
theoretical benchmark for Transformers, have not been thoroughly analyzed in
the context of Mamba. To address this gap, we study the training dynamics of
Mamba on the linear regression ICL task. By developing novel techniques
tackling non-convex optimization with gradient descent related to Mamba's
structure, we establish an exponential convergence rate to ICL solution, and
derive a loss bound that is comparable to Transformer's. Importantly, our
results reveal that Mamba can perform a variant of \textit{online gradient
descent} to learn the latent function in context. This mechanism is different
from that of Transformer, which is typically understood to achieve ICL through
gradient descent emulation. The theoretical results are verified by
experimental simulation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Visual CoT improves reasoning in Vision-Language Models but is sensitive to image noise. A solution using Grounding DINO model alleviates this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate robustness and sensitivity of Visual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques in Vision-Language Models under visual noise.

Method: Evaluate Visual CoT-based Vision-Language Models on 12 image corruption types across 4 VQA datasets and propose integrating Grounding DINO for stabilization.

Result: Visual CoT improves accuracy but is more sensitive to visual perturbations, showing sharper performance degradation compared to regular VLMs.

Conclusion: Identified fragility in Visual CoT and introduced a plug-and-play enhancement method for architectural robustness using Grounding DINO model.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly enhanced reasoning in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Extending this paradigm, Visual CoT integrates
explicit visual edits, such as cropping or annotating regions of interest, into
the reasoning process, achieving superior multimodal performance. However, the
robustness of Visual CoT-based VLMs against image-level noise remains
unexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of Visual
CoT robustness under visual perturbations. Our benchmark spans 12 image
corruption types across 4 Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets, enabling a
comprehensive comparison between VLMs that use Visual CoT, and VLMs that do
not. The results reveal that integrating Visual CoT consistently improves
absolute accuracy regardless of whether the input images are clean or corrupted
by noise; however, it also increases sensitivity to input perturbations,
resulting in sharper performance degradation compared to standard VLMs. Through
extensive analysis, we identify the intermediate reasoning components of Visual
CoT, i.e., the edited image patches , as the primary source of fragility.
Building on this analysis, we propose a plug-and-play robustness enhancement
method that integrates Grounding DINO model into the Visual CoT pipeline,
providing high-confidence local visual cues to stabilize reasoning. Our work
reveals clear fragility patterns in Visual CoT and offers an effective,
architecture-agnostic solution for enhancing visual robustness.

### [886] [Enhancing LLM Steering through Sparse Autoencoder-Based Vector Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23799)
*Anyi Wang,Xuansheng Wu,Dong Shu,Yunpu Ma,Ninghao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new method called SAE-RSV is proposed to improve steering vectors for large language models using sparse autoencoders, making them effective even with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for steering large language models often require large datasets and fail with smaller datasets due to noise and task-irrelevant features.

Method: The paper introduces SAE-RSV, which uses sparse autoencoders to semantically denoise and augment steering vectors by removing irrelevant features and adding task-relevant ones.

Result: The SAE-RSV method significantly outperforms baseline methods, including supervised fine-tuning, in steering large language models when trained on limited data.

Conclusion: Effective steering vectors can be generated even from small datasets by applying semantic refinements with sparse autoencoders.

Abstract: Steering has emerged as a promising approach in controlling large language
models (LLMs) without modifying model parameters. However, most existing
steering methods rely on large-scale datasets to learn clear behavioral
information, which limits their applicability in many real-world scenarios. The
steering vectors extracted from small dataset often contain task-irrelevant
noising features, which degrades their effectiveness. To refine the steering
vectors learned from limited data, we introduce Refinement of Steering Vector
via Sparse Autoencoder (SAE-RSV) that leverages SAEs to semantically denoise
and augment the steering vectors. In our framework, we first remove
task-irrelevant features according to their semantics provided by SAEs, and
then enrich task-relevant features missing from the small dataset through their
semantic similarity to the identified relevant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed SAE-RSV substantially outperforms all the
baseline methods including supervised fine-tuning. Our findings show that
effective steering vector can be constructed from limited training data by
refining the original steering vector through SAEs.

### [887] [STAIR: Addressing Stage Misalignment through Temporal-Aligned Preference Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23802)
*Yao Luan,Ni Mu,Yiqin Yang,Bo Xu,Qing-Shan Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents "STage-AlIgned Reward learning" (STAIR), a novel approach to improve preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) in multi-stage tasks by addressing stage misalignment, thus improving policy learning and human-aligned stage identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) in multi-stage tasks, specifically the issue of stage misalignment, which leads to uninformative feedback and hinders policy learning.

Method: The proposed method, STAIR, uses temporal distance approximated by contrastive learning to identify and prioritize comparisons within the same stage. This approach groups temporally close states dynamically without predefined task knowledge.

Result: The STAIR approach demonstrates superior performance in multi-stage tasks and competitive performance in single-stage tasks through extensive experiments. Human studies further confirm that STAIR effectively mitigates stage misalignment and aligns with human cognition.

Conclusion: STAIR effectively addresses stage misalignment in multi-stage tasks, enhancing the learning process in preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL). It delivers better task performance and aligns stages with human understanding.

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) bypasses complex reward
engineering by learning rewards directly from human preferences, enabling
better alignment with human intentions. However, its effectiveness in
multi-stage tasks, where agents sequentially perform sub-tasks (e.g.,
navigation, grasping), is limited by stage misalignment: Comparing segments
from mismatched stages, such as movement versus manipulation, results in
uninformative feedback, thus hindering policy learning. In this paper, we
validate the stage misalignment issue through theoretical analysis and
empirical experiments. To address this issue, we propose STage-AlIgned Reward
learning (STAIR), which first learns a stage approximation based on temporal
distance, then prioritizes comparisons within the same stage. Temporal distance
is learned via contrastive learning, which groups temporally close states into
coherent stages, without predefined task knowledge, and adapts dynamically to
policy changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate STAIR's superiority in
multi-stage tasks and competitive performance in single-stage tasks.
Furthermore, human studies show that stages approximated by STAIR are
consistent with human cognition, confirming its effectiveness in mitigating
stage misalignment.

### [888] [Beyond the Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off: A Hidden State Approach for LLM Reasoning in RLVR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23808)
*Fanding Huang,Guanbo Huang,Xiao Fan,Yi He,Xiao Liang,Xiao Chen,Qinting Jiang,Faisal Nadeem Khan,Jingyan Jiang,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the traditional exploration-exploitation trade-off in RLVR and introduces a method to enhance both simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To re-examine and challenge the notion of an inherent exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning, and to find a way to enhance both processes simultaneously.

Method: Proposed Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL), leveraging Effective Rank derivatives (ERV and ERA) to balance exploration and exploitation without forcing a trade-off.

Result: VERL demonstrated significant and consistent performance improvements across benchmarks, including up to a 21.4% accuracy gain on the Gaokao 2024 dataset.

Conclusion: Exploration and exploitation can be synergistically enhanced with a novel incentive structure, offering a paradigm shift in designing RL systems for verifiable rewards.

Abstract: A prevailing view in Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
interprets recent progress through the lens of an exploration-exploitation
trade-off, a perspective largely shaped by token-level metrics. We re-examine
this perspective, proposing that this perceived trade-off may not be a
fundamental constraint but rather an artifact of the measurement level. To
investigate this, we shift the analysis to the semantically rich hidden-state
space, adopting Effective Rank (ER) to quantify exploration and proposing its
novel first- and second-order derivatives, named Effective Rank Velocity (ERV)
and Effective Rank Acceleration (ERA), to capture exploitation dynamics. Our
analysis reveals that at the hidden-state level, exploration and exploitation
could be decoupled (Sec. 4). This finding reveals an opportunity to enhance
both capacities simultaneously. This insight motivates our method,
Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL), the first to operationalize the
principle of synergistic exploration-exploitation enhancement by directly
shaping the RL advantage function. The key innovation is leveraging the
theoretically stable ERA as a predictive meta-controller to create a
synergistic, dual-channel incentive structure. Instead of forcing a trade-off,
VERL prospectively amplifies rewards for exploration to preempt overconfidence
and reinforces exploitative gains to consolidate reasoning. Experiments across
diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains, including up to
21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging Gaokao 2024 dataset.

### [889] [Tequila: Trapping-free Ternary Quantization for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23809)
*Hong Huang,Decheng Wu,Rui Cen,Guanghua Yu,Zonghang Li,Kai Liu,Jianchen Zhu,Peng Chen,Xue Liu,Dapeng Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tequila, a novel ternary weight quantization method, addresses accuracy loss caused by deadzone trapping by reactivating trapped weights as dynamic biases, achieving high performance while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization is vital for deploying large language models on edge devices due to resource constraints, but prevalent methods suffer from inefficiency and accuracy loss, necessitating hardware-efficient and accurate solutions.

Method: Tequila reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing them as dynamic biases to provide continuous signals in the forward pass and meaningful gradients during backpropagation, enhancing model optimization.

Result: Tequila achieves >4% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art techniques across five benchmarks, practically matching full-precision accuracy with a 3.0x inference speedup, demonstrating its efficiency.

Conclusion: Tequila offers a practical ternary quantization framework that enhances performance and efficiency of LLMs on edge devices, addressing key limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Quantization techniques are essential for the deployment of Large Language
Models (LLMs) on edge devices. However, prevailing methods often rely on
mixed-precision multiplication that lacks efficient hardware support, making it
not feasible. Ternary weight quantization addresses this by constraining
weights to {-1, 0, 1}, replacing expensive multiplications with
hardware-efficient additions. However, such aggressive compression leads to
significant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training
with massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large
number of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary. This occurs because
these weights receive only noisy, uninformative gradients, preventing stable
escape from the deadzone and severely impeding model capacity and optimization.
To address this issue, we propose Tequila, a trapping-free quantization
optimization method that reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing
them as dynamic biases. This allows the repurposed weights to provide a
continuous signal in the forward pass and, critically, receive direct,
meaningful gradient signals during backpropagation, thereby enhancing model
capacity and optimization with nearly zero inference overhead. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that Tequila outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
ternary quantization methods across five benchmarks. Specifically, on the ARC
benchmark, it achieves >4% accuracy gain over the SOTA baseline, nearly
matching full-precision performance (within <1% gap) with a 3.0x inference
speedup. Consequently, Tequila offers a highly practical and efficient
implementation for the deployment of advanced LLMs in resource-constrained
environments. The code is available at https://github.com/Tencent/AngelSlim.

### [890] [IndexNet: Timestamp and Variable-Aware Modeling for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23813)
*Beiliang Wu,Peiyuan Liu,Yifan Hu,Luyan Zhang,Ao Hu,Zenglin Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IndexNet enhances multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) by leveraging index-related contextual semantics using MLP-based architecture with specialized timestamp and variable embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing MTSF methods fail to utilize index-related descriptive information, like timestamps and variable indices, which are critical for capturing contextual semantics.

Method: Proposed an MLP-based framework, IndexNet, with an Index Embedding module. This module includes Timestamp Embedding (TE) for encoding temporal information and Channel Embedding (CE) for distinguishing heterogeneous variables.

Result: IndexNet demonstrated competitive performance across 12 real-world datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in temporal and variable-aware modeling.

Conclusion: IndexNet improves the generality and interpretability of MTSF while addressing gaps in utilizing index-related semantic information overlooked by prior methods.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in a wide
range of real-world applications, such as weather prediction and traffic flow
forecasting. Although recent advances have significantly improved the modeling
of temporal dynamics and inter-variable dependencies, most existing methods
overlook index-related descriptive information, such as timestamps and variable
indices, which carry rich contextual semantics. To unlock the potential of such
information and take advantage of the lightweight and powerful periodic capture
ability of MLP-based architectures, we propose IndexNet, an MLP-based framework
augmented with an Index Embedding (IE) module. The IE module consists of two
key components: Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE).
Specifically, TE transforms timestamps into embedding vectors and injects them
into the input sequence, thereby improving the model's ability to capture
long-term complex periodic patterns. In parallel, CE assigns each variable a
unique and trainable identity embedding based on its index, allowing the model
to explicitly distinguish between heterogeneous variables and avoid homogenized
predictions when input sequences seem close. Extensive experiments on 12
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that IndexNet achieves comparable
performance across mainstream baselines, validating the effectiveness of our
temporally and variably aware design. Moreover, plug-and-play experiments and
visualization analyses further reveal that IndexNet exhibits strong generality
and interpretability, two aspects that remain underexplored in current MTSF
research.

*Bo Li,Xin Zheng,Ming Jin,Can Wang,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DyGEval, a framework for evaluating the performance of Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs) on unseen and unlabeled dynamic graphs during test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs) often face performance uncertainty during inference on unseen test graphs due to evolving data distributions. There is a need for a method to assess their performance under such conditions.

Method: A two-stage framework, DyGEval, is proposed. It includes (1) test-time dynamic graph simulation to train an evaluator with distributional differences and (2) development of a model to estimate DGNN performance on unseen graphs.

Result: Experiments show that DyGEval effectively evaluates various DGNN architectures across dynamic graphs with distribution shifts.

Conclusion: DyGEval proves to be an effective and innovative solution to the problem of DGNN model evaluation, enabling better deployment decisions in real-world applications.

Abstract: Dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a leading paradigm for
learning from dynamic graphs, which are commonly used to model real-world
systems and applications. However, due to the evolving nature of dynamic graph
data distributions over time, well-trained DGNNs often face significant
performance uncertainty when inferring on unseen and unlabeled test graphs in
practical deployment. In this case, evaluating the performance of deployed
DGNNs at test time is crucial to determine whether a well-trained DGNN is
suited for inference on an unseen dynamic test graph. In this work, we
introduce a new research problem: DGNN model evaluation, which aims to assess
the performance of a specific DGNN model trained on observed dynamic graphs by
estimating its performance on unseen dynamic graphs during test time.
Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Graph neural network Evaluator, dubbed
DyGEval, to address this new problem. The proposed DyGEval involves a two-stage
framework: (1) test-time dynamic graph simulation, which captures the
training-test distributional differences as supervision signals and trains an
evaluator; and (2) DyGEval development and training, which accurately estimates
the performance of the well-trained DGNN model on the test-time dynamic graphs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DyGEval serves as an
effective evaluator for assessing various DGNN backbones across different
dynamic graphs under distribution shifts.

### [892] [Space Group Conditional Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23822)
*Omri Puny,Yaron Lipman,Benjamin Kurt Miller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Space Group Conditional Flow Matching, a generative framework for creating symmetric, stable inorganic crystals by incorporating space group and Wyckoff position symmetries into the generation process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing generative models for atomic coordinates fail to account for symmetry constraints of crystallographic space groups, resulting in unrealistic and asymmetrical crystal predictions.

Method: The proposed method conditions the generation process on specific space groups and Wyckoff positions using a symmetric noise base distribution and a group-conditioned, equivariant vector field. It implements an efficient group averaging reformulation to minimize computational overhead while maintaining symmetry.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art outcomes in crystal structure prediction and de novo generation benchmarks, producing more symmetric and stable crystals. Relevant ablation studies are also conducted.

Conclusion: The method significantly improves the realism and symmetry of generated crystals, demonstrating the importance of conditioning on space group symmetries in generative models.

Abstract: Inorganic crystals are periodic, highly-symmetric arrangements of atoms in
three-dimensional space. Their structures are constrained by the symmetry
operations of a crystallographic \emph{space group} and restricted to lie in
specific affine subspaces known as \emph{Wyckoff positions}. The frequency an
atom appears in the crystal and its rough positioning are determined by its
Wyckoff position. Most generative models that predict atomic coordinates
overlook these symmetry constraints, leading to unrealistically high
populations of proposed crystals exhibiting limited symmetry. We introduce
Space Group Conditional Flow Matching, a novel generative framework that
samples significantly closer to the target population of highly-symmetric,
stable crystals. We achieve this by conditioning the entire generation process
on a given space group and set of Wyckoff positions; specifically, we define a
conditionally symmetric noise base distribution and a group-conditioned,
equivariant, parametric vector field that restricts the motion of atoms to
their initial Wyckoff position. Our form of group-conditioned equivariance is
achieved using an efficient reformulation of \emph{group averaging} tailored
for symmetric crystals. Importantly, it reduces the computational overhead of
symmetrization to a negligible level. We achieve state of the art results on
crystal structure prediction and de novo generation benchmarks. We also perform
relevant ablations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ECD²G, a novel method that utilizes principles from electrical engineering to perform discrete data generation by modeling probability flows as electric currents in a circuit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to develop a new perspective for data generation in discrete settings by establishing a connection between electrical circuit theory and probability mass transfer, aiming for a theoretically grounded and innovative approach.

Method: The proposed method maps data generation as analogous to electric current flow in a circuit. The source distribution is treated as current input nodes, and the target distribution as output nodes. A neural network learns the probability flow (electric currents) in the circuit, ensuring the theoretical transfer between distributions.

Result: Proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the ECD²G method in reliably transferring data distributions based on the learned mappings.

Conclusion: ECD²G introduces a novel way to connect electrical circuit theory with discrete data generation, providing a provable and effective method for mapping and transferring data between distributions.

Abstract: We propose $\textbf{E}$lectric $\textbf{C}$urrent $\textbf{D}$iscrete
$\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{G}$eneration (ECD$^{2}$G), a pioneering method for
data generation in discrete settings that is grounded in electrical engineering
theory. Our approach draws an analogy between electric current flow in a
circuit and the transfer of probability mass between data distributions. We
interpret samples from the source distribution as current input nodes of a
circuit and samples from the target distribution as current output nodes. A
neural network is then used to learn the electric currents to represent the
probability flow in the circuit. To map the source distribution to the target,
we sample from the source and transport these samples along the circuit
pathways according to the learned currents. This process provably guarantees
transfer between data distributions. We present proof-of-concept experiments to
illustrate our ECD$^{2}$G method.

TL;DR: This paper introduces "Adversarial Diffusion for Robust Reinforcement Learning (AD-RRL)", an RL method that uses diffusion models to improve robustness against uncertainties, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of robustness in reinforcement learning (RL) methods when faced with modeling errors and uncertainties.

Method: The authors propose AD-RRL, which leverages diffusion models conditioned to generate worst-case trajectories, using Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) optimization to improve robustness during training.

Result: AD-RRL outperforms existing robust RL methods in terms of robustness and performance on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: The use of diffusion models effectively enhances RL policy robustness by addressing uncertainty in environment dynamics, demonstrating the promise of this approach in robust RL.

Abstract: Robustness to modeling errors and uncertainties remains a central challenge
in reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we address this challenge by
leveraging diffusion models to train robust RL policies. Diffusion models have
recently gained popularity in model-based RL due to their ability to generate
full trajectories "all at once", mitigating the compounding errors typical of
step-by-step transition models. Moreover, they can be conditioned to sample
from specific distributions, making them highly flexible. We leverage
conditional sampling to learn policies that are robust to uncertainty in
environment dynamics. Building on the established connection between
Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) optimization and robust RL, we introduce
Adversarial Diffusion for Robust Reinforcement Learning (AD-RRL). AD-RRL guides
the diffusion process to generate worst-case trajectories during training,
effectively optimizing the CVaR of the cumulative return. Empirical results
across standard benchmarks show that AD-RRL achieves superior robustness and
performance compared to existing robust RL methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DART proposes a novel RL framework for GUI agents, addressing inefficiencies and improving task success rates through decoupled training and data curation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in training reinforcement learning models for GUI agents, such as slow multi-turn interactions and lack of high-quality data.

Method: DART utilizes a decoupled framework with four asynchronous modules to enable efficient training. It also incorporates adaptive data curation techniques to optimize learning.

Result: The DART-GUI-7B model achieved a 42.13% task success rate, which is a substantial improvement over existing models and open-source state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework introduces innovative practices that enhance system efficiency and RL policy learning. The approach is set to benefit the broader open-source community.

Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM) based GUI agents show promise for automating
complex desktop and mobile tasks, but face significant challenges in applying
reinforcement learning (RL): (1) slow multi-turn interactions with GUI
environments for policy rollout, and (2) insufficient high-quality
agent-environment interactions for policy learning. To address these
challenges, we propose DART, a Decoupled Agentic RL Training framework for GUI
agents, which coordinates heterogeneous modules in a highly decoupled manner.
DART separates the training system into four asynchronous modules: environment
cluster, rollout service, data manager, and trainer. This design enables
non-blocking communication, asynchronous training, rollout-wise trajectory
sampling, and per-worker model synchronization, significantly improving the
system efficiency: 1.6*GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9* training throughput,
and 5.5* environment utilization. To facilitate effective learning from
abundant samples, we introduce an adaptive data curation scheme: (1)
pre-collecting successful trajectories for challenging tasks to supplement
sparse success in online sampling; (2) dynamically adjusting rollout numbers
and trajectory lengths based on task difficulty; (3) training selectively on
high-entropy steps to prioritize critical decisions; (4) stabilizing learning
via truncated importance sampling for policy mismatch between policy rollout
and updating. On the OSWorld benchmark, DART-GUI-7B achieves a 42.13% task
success rate, a 14.61% absolute gain over the base model, and 7.34% higher than
open-source SOTA. We will fully open-source our training framework, data, and
model checkpoints via computer-use-agents.github.io/dart-gui, which we believe
is a timely contribution to the open-source community of agentic RL training.

*Simon Schrodi,Elias Kempf,Fazl Barez,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the phenomenon of subliminal learning, where biases transfer from teacher to student language models during distillation, even under hard distillation conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and how subliminal learning—bias transfer from teacher to student models during distillation—occurs and to uncover its underlying mechanisms.

Method: The authors conducted controlled experiments and mechanistic analyses to evaluate subliminal learning, focusing on divergence tokens and layers in neural networks.

Result: Key findings include that subliminal learning is driven by divergence tokens, early layers are critical in bias transfer, and subtle interventions like masking specific tokens or altering prompts can suppress it.

Conclusion: Subliminal learning is fragile and can be controlled by targeting divergence tokens or modifying prompts, highlighting opportunities to mitigate bias in model distillation.

Abstract: Language models can transfer hidden biases during distillation. For example,
a teacher that "likes owls" can make its student "like owls" too, even when the
training data consists only of lists of numbers. This surprising phenomenon is
called subliminal learning. Subliminal learning can be expected under soft
distillation, where the student is trained on the teacher's full next-token
distribution. But the fact that this also occurs under hard distillation-where
the student only sees sampled tokens-raises a deeper question: when and how
does subliminal learning actually occur? We answer this question through
controlled experiments and mechanistic analysis. Our results show that
subliminal learning does not need (global) token entanglement or logit leakage.
Instead, it comes down to a small set of divergence tokens-rare cases where
teachers with different biases would predict different tokens. Masking out
these tokens mostly removes the hidden bias transfer. Mechanistically,
divergence tokens reveal that early layers are critical. Surprisingly,
finetuning even a single such early layer is sufficient for subliminal
learning. Finally, we find that subliminal learning is fragile. Even small
changes, like paraphrasing prompts, are usually sufficient to suppress it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the success of gradient-based optimization methods in training large, complex deep neural networks, a unified theoretical framework is needed.

Method: The authors develop a single general theorem proving linear convergence of gradient flow for neural networks with piecewise non-zero polynomial or ReLU/sigmoid activations.

Result: The theorem consolidates prior results under weaker assumptions and establishes convergence for architectures not previously studied, showing strong empirical agreement with practical gradient descent.

Conclusion: This work provides a theoretical foundation for gradient optimization in neural networks, demonstrating unified linear convergence with practical validation.

Abstract: A key challenge in modern deep learning theory is to explain the remarkable
success of gradient-based optimization methods when training large-scale,
complex deep neural networks. Though linear convergence of such methods has
been proved for a handful of specific architectures, a united theory still
evades researchers. This article presents a unified proof for linear
convergence of continuous gradient descent, also called gradient flow, while
training any neural network with piecewise non-zero polynomial activations or
ReLU, sigmoid activations. Our primary contribution is a single, general
theorem that not only covers architectures for which this result was previously
unknown but also consolidates existing results under weaker assumptions. While
our focus is theoretical and our results are only exact in the infinitesimal
step size limit, we nevertheless find excellent empirical agreement between the
predictions of our result and those of the practical step-size gradient descent
method.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DOC, a method to address catastrophic forgetting in LLMs during continual learning by tracking and adjusting functional directions during fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in large language models (LLMs) when fine-tuning on new data without access to past datasets.

Method: Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning dynamically tracks and updates functional directions, and adjusts gradients to mitigate interference between tasks.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that DOC reduces catastrophic forgetting and outperforms prior methods on LLM continual learning benchmarks.

Conclusion: DOC enhances continual learning in LLMs by effectively addressing catastrophic forgetting, offering a robust fine-tuning solution.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge in continual learning
for large language models (LLMs), where models struggle to retain performance
on historical tasks when fine-tuning on new sequential data without access to
past datasets. In this paper, we first reveal that the drift of functional
directions during the fine-tuning process is a key reason why existing
regularization-based methods fail in long-term LLM continual learning. To
address this, we propose Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning, a
novel approach that tracks the drift of these functional directions and
dynamically updates them during the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, by
adjusting the gradients of new task parameters to be orthogonal to the tracked
historical function directions, our method mitigates interference between new
and old tasks. Extensive experiments on various LLM continual learning
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach outperforms prior methods,
effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting and providing a robust tool for
continuous LLM fine-tuning. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle coverage limitations in infrastructure-deficient environments and overcome unreliable air-to-ground communication due to complex geographic constraints.

Method: The paper introduces a Markov decision process for UAV resource allocation and trajectory control, employing a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with a novel hybrid proximal policy optimization algorithm that enforces constraints via action masking.

Result: The proposed approach achieves high fairness (index of 0.99) and reduces UAV energy consumption by up to 25% compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The integrated communication and control co-design mechanism enhances UAV swarm-assisted networks by optimizing energy consumption and communication fairness, making it suitable for complex geographic environments.

Abstract: The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm-assisted communication
networks has become an increasingly vital approach for remediating coverage
limitations in infrastructure-deficient environments, with especially pressing
applications in temporary scenarios, such as emergency rescue, military and
security operations, and remote area coverage. However, complex geographic
environments lead to unpredictable and highly dynamic wireless channel
conditions, resulting in frequent interruptions of air-to-ground (A2G) links
that severely constrain the reliability and quality of service in UAV
swarm-assisted mobile communications. To improve the quality of UAV
swarm-assisted communications in complex geographic environments, we propose an
integrated communication and control co-design mechanism. Given the stringent
energy constraints inherent in UAV swarms, our proposed mechanism is designed
to optimize energy efficiency while maintaining an equilibrium between
equitable communication rates for mobile ground users (GUs) and UAV energy
expenditure. We formulate the joint resource allocation and 3D trajectory
control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and develop a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to enable real-time coordinated actions
across the UAV swarm. To optimize the action policy of UAV swarms, we propose a
novel multi-agent hybrid proximal policy optimization with action masking
(MAHPPO-AM) algorithm, specifically designed to handle complex hybrid action
spaces. The algorithm incorporates action masking to enforce hard constraints
in high-dimensional action spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach achieves a fairness index of 0.99 while reducing energy consumption by
up to 25% compared to baseline methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in analyzing and deriving insights from sparse time-series data using interpretable machine learning models.

Method: GMAN encodes each time-series trajectory into directed graphs and employs a more expressive version of GNANs to process them, enabling feature, node, and graph-level interpretability.

Result: GMAN achieves superior performance compared to non-interpretable models in tasks such as mortality prediction and fake-news detection.

Conclusion: The framework offers a balance between model interpretability and expressivity, allowing for domain-specific explanations while outperforming traditional models.

Abstract: We introduce GMAN, a flexible, interpretable, and expressive framework that
extends Graph Neural Additive Networks (GNANs) to learn from sets of sparse
time-series data. GMAN represents each time-dependent trajectory as a directed
graph and applies an enriched, more expressive GNAN to each graph. It allows
users to control the interpretability-expressivity trade-off by grouping
features and graphs to encode priors, and it provides feature, node, and
graph-level interpretability. On real-world datasets, including mortality
prediction from blood tests and fake-news detection, GMAN outperforms strong
non-interpretable black-box baselines while delivering actionable,
domain-aligned explanations.

### [901] [HiViS: Hiding Visual Tokens from the Drafter for Speculative Decoding in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23928)
*Zhinan Xie,Peisong Wang,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiViS proposes a new framework to accelerate Vision-Language Model (VLM) inference by eliminating inefficiencies introduced by visual tokens in speculative decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are inefficiencies in adapting speculative decoding from Large Language Models (LLMs) to Vision-Language Models (VLMs) due to visual token misalignment and the computational burden of handling a large number of visual tokens.

Method: HiViS removes visual tokens from the drafter's input, uses the target VLM's hidden states as implicit visual inputs, and employs a multi-step self-feedback training strategy to train the drafter efficiently while retaining generation quality.

Result: HiViS reduces the drafter's prefill sequence length to 0.7%-1.3% of the target VLM's input size and achieves up to 2.65x speedup across various models and tasks, with no loss in generation quality.

Conclusion: HiViS effectively addresses inefficiencies in VLM speculative decoding, significantly accelerating inference while preserving output quality.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective approach for accelerating inference in
Large Language models (LLMs), but its adaptation to Vision-Language models
(VLMs) remains challenging for additional visual tokens in multimodal inputs.
First, owing to the fact that the drafter and the target VLM may derived from
different families, the semantic representations of visual tokens in the target
VLM are misaligned with those in the drafter, introducing bias into the
KV-cache during the prefill stage. Second, the large number of visual tokens
substantially slows down the drafter's self-attention during the decoding
stage. We propose Hiding Visual Tokens from the Drafter for Speculative
Decoding in Vision-Language Models (HiViS), an explicit-implicit input
decomposition framework that alleviates the above inefficiency. All visual
tokens are removed from the drafter's input, retaining only textual tokens as
explicit inputs, while directly reusing the target VLM's corresponding
last-layer hidden states as implicit visual information without additional
processing. To train the drafter efficiently, we introduces multi-step
self-feedback training strategy with dynamic data selection and sequential
embedding supervision to simulate reasoning during training. Our approach
compresses the prefill sequence length of the drafter to only 0.7%-1.3% of the
target VLM's input, while maintaining lossless generation quality. Extensive
experiments across diverse models and tasks demonstrate up to 2.65x speedup,
confirming the effectiveness of HiViS in accelerating VLM inference.

*Jiahao Ying,Mingbao Lin,Qianru Sun,Yixin Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture using an internal metric to discover insights about routing mechanisms, neuron utilization trends, and collaboration among experts, aiming to complement benchmark performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors observe limited understanding of Mixture-of-Experts architectures, restricting their broader progress despite their efficiency and scalability.

Method: The study utilizes an internal metric called MUI to explore neuron utilization, model training dynamics, and expert-level task behaviors in publicly available MoE models.

Result: Key discoveries include declining neuron utilization with model evolution, dynamic training trajectories, collaborative expert behaviors for task completion, and activation patterns reflecting data diversity.

Conclusion: MUI emerges as a potential complementary metric to benchmark performance, offering systematic insights into the mechanisms and specialization of MoE models.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising direction,
offering efficiency and scalability by activating only a subset of parameters
during inference. However, current research remains largely
performance-centric, with limited understanding of its internal mechanisms,
thereby constraining broader progress. In this work, we use an internal metric
to investigate the mechanisms of MoE architecture by explicitly incorporating
routing mechanisms and analyzing expert-level behaviors. Through systematic
analyses of a wide range of publicly available MoE models, we uncover several
findings: (1) neuron utilization decreases as models evolve, reflecting
stronger generalization; (2) training exhibits a dynamic trajectory, where
benchmark performance alone provides limited signal while MUI reveals deeper
insights; (3) task completion emerges from collaborative contributions of
multiple experts, with shared experts driving concentration; and (4) activation
patterns at the neuron level provide a fine-grained proxy for data diversity.
Together, these results demonstrate the potential of MUI as a complementary
indicator to benchmark performance, offering new insights into the capacity,
dynamics, and specialization of MoE models. Our project can be found at

### [903] [Diffusion Models are Kelly Gamblers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23937)
*Akhil Premkumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper connects diffusion models with the Kelly criterion, finding a link between mutual information stored in conditional models and boosting strategies like classifier-free guidance. It explores nuances in viewing diffusion models as infinitely deep autoencoders and connects denoising loss to quantum mechanics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical underpinnings of diffusion models by analyzing their connection to information theory and quantum mechanics.

Method: The study establishes connections between mutual information, classifier-free guidance, the manifold hypothesis, and diffusion models, alongside a detailed comparison to the Fermi Golden Rule.

Result: Conditional diffusion models store mutual information that links signals and conditioning. Classifier-free guidance enhances mutual information during sampling, particularly aiding image models with low signal-label information.

Conclusion: Diffusion models contain rich theoretical connections to information and quantum mechanics, with practical implications for improving sampling quality, especially in image-generation tasks.

Abstract: We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for
maximizing returns in betting games. We find that conditional diffusion models
store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning
information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. Classifier-free
guidance effectively boosts the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ at
sampling time. This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual
information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately
connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the
popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In
doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum
mechanics.

### [904] [Efficient Identification of High Similarity Clusters in Polygon Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23942)
*John N. Daras*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new framework is proposed to optimize spatial similarity computations for large datasets, focusing on reducing computational loads through targeted cluster verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling spatial similarity computations to large datasets encounters significant challenges due to extensive computational requirements.

Method: The framework uses dynamic similarity index thresholding, supervised scheduling, recall-constrained optimization, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), and machine learning models to prioritize clusters.

Result: Experimental results confirm that the method reduces computational costs substantially while maintaining accuracy and scalability for large-scale geospatial analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses challenges in geospatial analysis by offering a scalable and accurate solution for managing vast datasets.

Abstract: Advancements in tools like Shapely 2.0 and Triton can significantly improve
the efficiency of spatial similarity computations by enabling faster and more
scalable geometric operations. However, for extremely large datasets, these
optimizations may face challenges due to the sheer volume of computations
required. To address this, we propose a framework that reduces the number of
clusters requiring verification, thereby decreasing the computational load on
these systems. The framework integrates dynamic similarity index thresholding,
supervised scheduling, and recall-constrained optimization to efficiently
identify clusters with the highest spatial similarity while meeting
user-defined precision and recall requirements. By leveraging Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) to dynamically determine similarity thresholds and machine
learning models to prioritize clusters, our approach achieves substantial
reductions in computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental
results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the method, offering a
practical solution for large-scale geospatial analysis.

### [905] [DiBS-MTL: Transformation-Invariant Multitask Learning with Direction Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23948)
*Surya Murthy,Kushagra Gupta,Mustafa O. Karabag,David Fridovich-Keil,Ufuk Topcu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DiBS-MTL, an MTL algorithm addressing issues with task domination by offering invariance to nonaffine task transformations, achieving Pareto stationary points in nonconvex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MTL methods suffer from task domination due to nonaffine scaling of task losses, which impacts overall performance. There's a need for algorithms that are robust to such transformations.

Method: The authors adapt DiBS (Direction-based Bargaining Solution) to MTL, proposing DiBS-MTL, which guarantees convergence to Pareto stationary points under nonconvex conditions.

Result: DiBS-MTL demonstrates competitive performance on standard MTL benchmarks while showing robustness against degrading monotonic nonaffine task loss transformations.

Conclusion: DiBS-MTL proves to be a promising approach for resolving task domination issues in MTL, achieving reliable performance and robustness against challenging loss transformations.

Abstract: Multitask learning (MTL) algorithms typically rely on schemes that combine
different task losses or their gradients through weighted averaging. These
methods aim to find Pareto stationary points by using heuristics that require
access to task loss values, gradients, or both. In doing so, a central
challenge arises because task losses can be arbitrarily, nonaffinely scaled
relative to one another, causing certain tasks to dominate training and degrade
overall performance. A recent advance in cooperative bargaining theory, the
Direction-based Bargaining Solution (DiBS), yields Pareto stationary solutions
immune to task domination because of its invariance to monotonic nonaffine task
loss transformations. However, the convergence behavior of DiBS in nonconvex
MTL settings is currently not understood. To this end, we prove that under
standard assumptions, a subsequence of DiBS iterates converges to a Pareto
stationary point when task losses are possibly nonconvex, and propose DiBS-MTL,
a computationally efficient adaptation of DiBS to the MTL setting. Finally, we
validate DiBS-MTL empirically on standard MTL benchmarks, showing that it
achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while
maintaining robustness to nonaffine monotonic transformations that
significantly degrade the performance of existing approaches, including prior
bargaining-inspired MTL methods. Code available at

### [906] [Evaluating the Robustness of Chinchilla Compute-Optimal Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23963)
*Rylan Schaeffer,Noam Levi,Andreas Kirsch,Theo Guenais,Brando Miranda,Elyas Obbad,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the validity of Chinchilla's compute-optimal scaling principles despite prior criticisms, determining they remain robust under varied interpretations and perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address criticisms surrounding the Chinchilla paper's findings, such as ambiguities, confidence interval issues, and scaling inconsistency, to assess its reliability for language model scaling.

Method: Analyzed three possible interpretations of Chinchilla's model parameters, assessed their impact on key results, and systematically perturbed the parameters to test the robustness of findings.

Result: The core results of Chinchilla remain largely unaffected by parameter ambiguities or structured perturbations, maintaining consistent scaling law insights and tokens-to-parameter ratios.

Conclusion: Chinchilla's compute-optimal scaling principles are reliable and durable, providing continued guidance for language model scaling despite underlying uncertainties or parameter errors.

Abstract: Hoffman et al (2022)'s Chinchilla paper introduced the principle of
compute-optimal scaling, laying a foundation for future scaling of language
models. In the years since, however, valid concerns about Chinchilla have been
raised: wide confidence intervals, discrepancies between its three approaches,
and incongruities with other scaling laws. This raises a critical question for
the field: Can practitioners still rely on Chinchilla's prescriptions? Our work
demonstrates the answer is yes. We begin by uncovering that the model
parameters central to Chinchilla's analyses were ambiguous: three
interpretations are possible, with relative differences between different
interpretations of model parameters as high as 15.2%. We find that, perhaps
surprisingly, which model parameters are used for the analyses do not
meaningfully affect key results: the scaling law estimates and the
compute-optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio. Indeed, under one interpretation,
the tokens-to-parameter ratio becomes more constant with the target compute
budget. We then ask how distorted the Chinchilla model parameters could have
been without meaningfully affecting the key results. By deliberately perturbing
model parameters in four structured ways, we find that key Chinchilla results
are most sensitive to additive or systematic errors, which can alter the
otherwise flat trend of the optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio, but overall,
Chinchilla's key results withstand sizable perturbations. Altogether, our
findings offer the field renewed confidence in Chinchilla as a durable guide
for scaling language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model-agnostic method to detect and fix label noise using neural network features, improving dataset quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label noise can negatively impact neural network training as deep networks grow larger; thus, automated error-detection tools are necessary.

Method: The method involves analyzing the penultimate feature of neural networks to detect and rectify mislabeled data based on its similarity to the true class cluster.

Result: Experiments demonstrate high performance under various noise types in detecting and correcting label errors, enhancing dataset quality.

Conclusion: The approach can effectively identify and rectify label noise, improving training datasets for modern deep networks.

Abstract: Label noise in datasets could damage the performance of neural net training.
As the size of modern deep networks grows, there is a growing demand for
automated tools for detecting such errors. In this paper, we propose post-hoc,
model-agnostic error detection and rectification methods utilizing the
penultimate feature from a neural network. Our idea is based on the observation
that the similarity between the penultimate feature of a mislabeled data point
and its true class data points is higher than that for data points from other
classes, making the probability of label occurrence within a tight, similar
cluster informative for detecting and rectifying errors. Extensive experiments
show our method not only demonstrates high performance across various noises
but also automatically rectifies these errors to improve the quality of
datasets.

*Maruf Ahmed Mridul,Oshani Seneviratne*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for generating gas-optimized smart contracts from financial specifications, demonstrating up to 35.59% gas savings compared to unoptimized baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The adoption of smart contracts for financial derivatives is limited due to the challenge of translating high-level financial specifications into efficient, executable code.

Method: The authors used a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) RL agent to select optimal code snippets from a library. A two-phase training curriculum was implemented to focus first on functional correctness, then on gas optimization.

Result: The RL agent successfully generated Solidity smart contracts with significant gas savings, achieving up to 35.59% cost reductions compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The approach provides an effective automated method to translate financial agreements into economically viable smart contracts, overcoming key adoption challenges in this domain.

Abstract: Smart contract-based automation of financial derivatives offers substantial
efficiency gains, but its real-world adoption is constrained by the complexity
of translating financial specifications into gas-efficient executable code. In
particular, generating code that is both functionally correct and economically
viable from high-level specifications, such as the Common Domain Model (CDM),
remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) framework to generate functional and gas-optimized Solidity smart
contracts directly from CDM specifications. We employ a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) agent that learns to select optimal code snippets from a
pre-defined library. To manage the complex search space, a two-phase curriculum
first trains the agent for functional correctness before shifting its focus to
gas optimization. Our empirical results show the RL agent learns to generate
contracts with significant gas savings, achieving cost reductions of up to
35.59% on unseen test data compared to unoptimized baselines. This work
presents a viable methodology for the automated synthesis of reliable and
economically sustainable smart contracts, bridging the gap between high-level
financial agreements and efficient on-chain execution.

*Amartya Roy,Devharish N,Shreya Ganguly,Kripabandhu Ghosh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GUIDE, a causal discovery framework leveraging LLM and a dual-encoder architecture, outperforming existing methods in scalability and accuracy while reducing computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional causal discovery methods face scalability, computational efficiency, and adaptability issues, particularly with higher-order nodes and mixed data types.

Method: GUIDE combines LLM-generated adjacency matrices and observational data using a dual-encoder architecture, optimized with reinforcement learning for accuracy and compliance with DAG constraints.

Result: GUIDE reduces runtime by around 42% compared to RL-BIC and KCRL, while increasing accuracy by approximately 117% over NOTEARS and GraN-DAG, with scalability to 70 or more nodes.

Conclusion: GUIDE addresses limitations in existing methods, providing a scalable, efficient, and accurate framework for causal discovery, effective across mixed data types.

Abstract: Modern causal discovery methods face critical limitations in scalability,
computational efficiency, and adaptability to mixed data types, as evidenced by
benchmarks on node scalability (30, $\le 50$, $\ge 70$ nodes), computational
energy demands, and continuous/non-continuous data handling. While traditional
algorithms like PC, GES, and ICA-LiNGAM struggle with these challenges,
exhibiting prohibitive energy costs for higher-order nodes and poor scalability
beyond 70 nodes, we propose \textbf{GUIDE}, a framework that integrates Large
Language Model (LLM)-generated adjacency matrices with observational data
through a dual-encoder architecture. GUIDE uniquely optimizes computational
efficiency, reducing runtime on average by $\approx 42%$ compared to RL-BIC and
KCRL methods, while achieving an average $\approx 117%$ improvement in accuracy
over both NOTEARS and GraN-DAG individually. During training, GUIDE's
reinforcement learning agent dynamically balances reward maximization
(accuracy) and penalty avoidance (DAG constraints), enabling robust performance
across mixed data types and scalability to $\ge 70$ nodes -- a setting where
baseline methods fail.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable attention model that accelerates diffusion transformers for video generation by classifying attention weights into critical, marginal, and negligible. SLA achieves a 20x reduction in computation, maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study tackles the inefficiency caused by the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms and long sequence lengths in video generation using Diffusion Transformers.

Method: The authors identify a split in attention weights between high-rank and low-rank parts and propose SLA, which applies selective attention techniques (O(N^2), O(N), or skipping) to different weight categories, integrating computations into one GPU kernel.

Result: SLA reduces attention computation by 95%, achieves a 13.7x speedup in GPU computation, and a 2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation while maintaining generation quality.

Conclusion: Sparse and low-rank attention acceleration (SLA) proves effective in vastly speeding up attention computations in video generation without compromising on quality, making it superior to baseline methods.

Abstract: In Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, particularly for video generation,
attention latency is a major bottleneck due to the long sequence length and the
quadratic complexity. We find that attention weights can be separated into two
parts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining
weights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse
acceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based
on this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable
attention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion
models. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and
negligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N)
attention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these
computations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward
passes. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x
reduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration
without loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention
computation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality,
outperforming baseline methods. In addition, we implement an efficient GPU
kernel for SLA, which yields a 13.7x speedup in attention computation and a
2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B.

*Rylan Schaeffer,Noam Levi,Brando Miranda,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates pretraining scaling laws in the context of generative tasks like mathematical problem-solving and software engineering, proposing three scaling laws based on compute, parameters+tokens, and log likelihoods of reference solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding and predicting generative performance through scaling laws, especially since most research focuses on discriminative evaluations.

Method: The paper introduces and evaluates three different pretraining scaling laws, focusing on their application to generative evaluations and their ability to predict performance at various levels of $k$.

Result: The compute and parameters+tokens scaling laws stabilize over smaller magnitudes compared to the gold reference likelihood scaling law. Predictive performance is comparable across the three, with slight variations based on the value of $k$.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical and practical insights, showing how scaling laws apply to generative tasks, and introduces a framework that connects compute and parameters+tokens scaling laws.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have played a central role in modern machine learning,
driving the field's ever-expanding scaling of parameters, data and compute.
While much research has gone into fitting scaling laws and predicting
performance on pretraining losses and on discriminative evaluations such as
multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has been done
on fitting scaling laws and predicting performance on generative evaluations
such as mathematical problem-solving or software engineering. We propose and
evaluate three different pretraining scaling laws for fitting pass-at-$k$ on
generative evaluations and for predicting pass-at-$k$ of the most expensive
model using the performance of cheaper models. Our three scaling laws differ in
the covariates used: (1) compute, (2) model parameters and tokens, (3) log
likelihoods of gold reference solutions. We make four main contributions: (1)
We show how generative evaluations offer new hyperparameters (in our setting,
$k$) that researchers can use to control the scaling laws parameters and the
predictability of performance. (2) In terms of scaling law parameters, we find
that the compute scaling law and parameters\,+\,tokens scaling law stabilize
for the last ~$1.5{-}2.5$ orders of magnitude, whereas the gold reference
likelihood scaling law stabilizes for the last ~$5$ orders of magnitude. (3) In
terms of predictive performance, we find all three scaling laws perform
comparably, although the compute scaling law predicts slightly worse for small
$k$ and the log likelihoods of gold reference solutions predicts slightly worse
for large $k$. (4) We establish a theoretical connection that the compute
scaling law emerges as the compute-optimal envelope of the
parameters-and-tokens scaling law. Our framework provides researchers and
practitioners with insights and methodologies to forecast generative
performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a foundation model for mobility data that leverages self-supervised learning to reconstruct missing trajectory segments and outperforms existing methods in trajectory-related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models have achieved significant results in other domains, and the authors aim to achieve similar breakthroughs in trajectory modeling by addressing challenges like understanding dynamics and contextual reasoning in mobility data.

Method: GPS-MTM uses a bi-directional Transformer architecture with a self-supervised masked modeling objective to learn semantic correlations in human movement data. It decomposes mobility data into states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent transitions) for better understanding.

Result: GPS-MTM consistently outperforms other methods across multiple datasets in tasks like trajectory infilling, next-stop prediction, and dynamics-related tasks where contextual reasoning is essential.

Conclusion: GPS-MTM establishes itself as a robust foundation model for trajectory analytics, effectively positioning mobility data as an important modality for large-scale representation learning.

Abstract: Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video
understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory
modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a
foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of
normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories
into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary
modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent
transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised
masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across
modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual
labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and
Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as
trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most
pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual
reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation
model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class
modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further
reference.

*Runyu Zhang,Na Li,Asuman Ozdaglar,Jeff Shamma,Gioele Zardini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a principled framework for incorporating risk-seeking optimism in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), introducing optimistic value functions and deriving a policy-gradient theorem for them. The proposed approach shows improved coordination over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the tendency of risk-averse multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods to reach suboptimal equilibria and to provide a theoretical grounding for optimistic cooperation-promoting methods.

Method: The authors use the dual representation of convex risk measures to formalize optimism in MARL as divergence-penalized risk-seeking objectives. They derive a policy-gradient theorem for optimistic value functions and propose optimistic actor-critic algorithms.

Result: Empirical evaluations on cooperative benchmarks show that the proposed risk-seeking optimistic framework consistently improves coordination, outperforming both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods.

Conclusion: The framework unifies risk-sensitive learning with optimism, offering a theoretically grounded and effective approach for improving cooperation in MARL.

Abstract: Risk sensitivity has become a central theme in reinforcement learning (RL),
where convex risk measures and robust formulations provide principled ways to
model preferences beyond expected return. Recent extensions to multi-agent RL
(MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness
to uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to
suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can
promote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice,
are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual
representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that
interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value
functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking
evaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem
for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic
risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic
algorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative
benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves
coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods.
Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a
theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in
MARL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for deciding whether a user query should be handled locally on-device or offloaded to the cloud, optimizing performance using a reward-based method instead of conventional binary classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient query routing in device-cloud collaboration, as existing classifiers struggle with assessing task difficulty from input prompts.

Method: They propose a post-training framework where on-device LLMs decide query routing by solving a formulated reward maximization problem using a group-adaptive policy gradient algorithm with constraints on cloud usage.

Result: The proposed method consistently outperforms traditional baselines and narrows the performance gap between on-device and cloud LLM solutions.

Conclusion: This methodology enhances the decision-making capabilities of on-device LLMs, offering a more effective solution for device-cloud collaboration while optimizing both performance and offloading constraints.

Abstract: Device-cloud collaboration has emerged as a promising paradigm for deploying
large language models (LLMs), combining the efficiency of lightweight on-device
inference with the superior performance of powerful cloud LLMs. An essential
problem in this scenario lies in deciding whether a given query is best handled
locally or delegated to the cloud. Existing approaches typically rely on
external routers, implemented as binary classifiers, which often struggle to
determine task difficulty from the prompt's surface pattern. To address these
limitations, we propose a framework where the on-device LLM makes routing
decisions at the end of its solving process, with this capability instilled
through post-training. In particular, we formulate a reward maximization
problem with carefully designed rewards that encourage effective problem
solving and judicious offloading to the cloud. To solve this problem, we
develop a group-adaptive policy gradient algorithm, featuring a group-level
policy gradient, designed to yield an unbiased gradient estimator of the
reward, and adaptive prompt filtering, developed to enforce the constraint on
cloud LLM usage. Extensive experiments across models and benchmarks show that
the proposed methodology consistently outperforms existing baselines and
significantly narrows the gap to full cloud LLM performance.

*Qiushui Xu,Yuhao Huang,Yushu Jiang,Lei Song,Jinyu Wang,Wenliang Zheng,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ICQL, an offline RL framework, to tackle compositional tasks by adapting Q-functions via context inference, demonstrating significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional Q-learning in offline RL for tasks with diverse subtasks, which often fail to capture compositional nature.

Method: Proposes ICQL, leveraging linear Transformers to infer local Q-functions from context, backed by theoretical guarantees of error bounds and near-optimal policy extraction.

Result: ICQL improves performance notably in various domains, achieving up to 16.4% gains in kitchen tasks and smaller improvements in Gym and Adroit tasks.

Conclusion: ICQL showcases a robust approach to Q-value estimation for offline RL, promoting in-context learning as a promising direction for complex tasks.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the Q-function is a central challenge in offline
reinforcement learning. However, existing approaches often rely on a single
global Q-function, which struggles to capture the compositional nature of tasks
involving diverse subtasks. We propose In-context Compositional Q-Learning
(\texttt{ICQL}), the first offline RL framework that formulates Q-learning as a
contextual inference problem, using linear Transformers to adaptively infer
local Q-functions from retrieved transitions without explicit subtask labels.
Theoretically, we show that under two assumptions--linear approximability of
the local Q-function and accurate weight inference from retrieved
context--\texttt{ICQL} achieves bounded Q-function approximation error, and
supports near-optimal policy extraction. Empirically, \texttt{ICQL}
substantially improves performance in offline settings: improving performance
in kitchen tasks by up to 16.4\%, and in Gym and Adroit tasks by up to 8.6\%
and 6.3\%. These results highlight the underexplored potential of in-context
learning for robust and compositional value estimation, positioning
\texttt{ICQL} as a principled and effective framework for offline RL.

*Roussel Rahman,Jeff Shrager*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Strategy Choice Theory (SCT) is reinterpreted as a Small Math Model (SMM) using neural networks, extending previous principles to include counting practice, symbol embedding, and attention mechanisms for arithmetic learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a more computationally modern and unified platform to investigate children's arithmetic learning using SCT principles extended to neural network models.

Method: A neural-network-based architecture (Small Math Model) builds upon Strategy Choice Theory principles, incorporating features like counting practice, symbol embeddings, and gated attention into arithmetic learning.

Result: The SMM demonstrates constructive and destructive interplay between counting and addition, and highlights phase-like improvements (e.g., reliance on finger-counting during recall).

Conclusion: This research suggests leveraging neural network platforms to extend the decades-long SCT framework towards adaptive strategy choice and strategy discovery, aiming for a deeper understanding of numerical reasoning in artificial systems.

Abstract: Strategy Choice Theory (SCT)\footnote{``Strategy Choice Theory'',
``Distributions of Associations'', and ``Overlapping Wave Theory'' have been
used to refer to this line of work, emphasizing different
aspects.}\citep[e.g.,][]{siegler1984strategychoices, siegler2000rebirth}
explains important aspects of children's arithmetic learning based upon
principles including learning from developmentally naturalistic data,
probabilistic representation, confidence-based retrieval, and the phase-like
importance of scaffolding strategies, such as finger-counting. Here we recast
SCT as a ``Small Math Model'' (SMM), employing a neural-network-based
architecture analogous to LLMs. The SMM extends SCT to include counting
practice\footnote{The original SCT model was pre-biased in accordance with the
supposed experience of counting.}, symbol (number) embedding, and gated
attention. Similar to earlier work, the SMM demonstrates constructive and
destructive interference between counting and addition, and the ``wave-like''
use of finger-counting as sum recall improves. We plan to extend the SMM to
later aspects of the decades-long SCT program, including adaptive strategy
choice and eventually strategy discovery, providing a unified platform to
investigate the understanding of numerical characteristics and relationships
essential for mathematical reasoning -- as it can emerge in LLM-based agents.

### [917] [AQUAIR: A High-Resolution Indoor Environmental Quality Dataset for Smart Aquaculture Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24069)
*Youssef Sabiri,Walid Houmaidi,Ouail El Maadi,Yousra Chtouki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AQUAIR, a public dataset collecting six indoor environmental quality variables from a fish aquaculture facility to support forecasting and anomaly-detection tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of public datasets combining indoor air parameters and water-quality dynamics, which limits advancements in smart aquaculture and predictive tools.

Method: AQUAIR was created by logging six IEQ variables using an Awair HOME monitor every five minutes over three months, coupled with sensor calibration checks, timestamp normalization, and data processing pipelines.

Result: The dataset contains over 23,000 observations documenting stable conditions with specific patterns, particularly during feeding times, providing potential for various analyses such as forecasting and event detection.

Conclusion: AQUAIR fills a critical data gap in aquaculture informatics, offering a benchmark for machine learning and environmental sensing research while facilitating advancements in smart aquaculture systems.

Abstract: Smart aquaculture systems depend on rich environmental data streams to
protect fish welfare, optimize feeding, and reduce energy use. Yet public
datasets that describe the air surrounding indoor tanks remain scarce, limiting
the development of forecasting and anomaly-detection tools that couple
head-space conditions with water-quality dynamics. We therefore introduce
AQUAIR, an open-access public dataset that logs six Indoor Environmental
Quality (IEQ) variables--air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide,
total volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 and PM10--inside a fish aquaculture
facility in Amghass, Azrou, Morocco. A single Awair HOME monitor sampled every
five minutes from 14 October 2024 to 9 January 2025, producing more than 23,000
time-stamped observations that are fully quality-controlled and publicly
archived on Figshare. We describe the sensor placement, ISO-compliant mounting
height, calibration checks against reference instruments, and an open-source
processing pipeline that normalizes timestamps, interpolates short gaps, and
exports analysis-ready tables. Exploratory statistics show stable conditions
(median CO2 = 758 ppm; PM2.5 = 12 micrograms/m3) with pronounced feeding-time
peaks, offering rich structure for short-horizon forecasting, event detection,
and sensor drift studies. AQUAIR thus fills a critical gap in smart aquaculture
informatics and provides a reproducible benchmark for data-centric machine
learning curricula and environmental sensing research focused on head-space
dynamics in recirculating aquaculture systems.

*Ju-Hyung Lee,Yanqing Lu,Klaus Doppler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEARL utilizes advanced adaptive techniques for cooperative device-to-device communication via lightweight on-device language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve device-to-device communication through peer-aware cross-layer optimization using lightweight technology.

Method: Introduces two variants of PEARL using LLMs: PEARL (Head + LoRA) and PEARL-Lite (Head-only) alongside KL-based finetuning and reward-aligned training.

Result: PEARL improves objective scores compared to baselines, achieves a reduction in energy by up to 16% in specific scenarios, and offers fast inference times.

Conclusion: PEARL demonstrates its efficiency in always-on communication scenarios, making lightweight LLMs practical for on-device control with reduced energy and enhanced performance.

Abstract: We present PEARL (Peer-Enhanced Adaptive Radio via On-Device LLM), a
framework for cooperative cross-layer optimization in device-to-device (D2D)
communication. Building on our previous work on single-device on-device LLMs,
PEARL extends the paradigm by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states
to guide Wi-Fi Aware (WA) parameter selection. A context-aware reward, which
normalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by device
battery states, provides richer supervision for KL-based finetuning. We study
two lightweight variants: PEARL (Head + Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)) achieves
the best overall performance, while PEARL-Lite (Head-only) delivers sub-20 ms
inference at near-identical objective scores. Across synthetic scenarios
grounded in real measurements, PEARL improves objective scores over heuristic
and compact model baselines and reduces energy by up to 16% in cooperative
low-battery cases. These results demonstrate that peer-aware context,
reward-aligned training, and head-based efficiency make LLMs practical for
always-on, on-device cross-layer control.

### [919] [ADAPT: Lightweight, Long-Range Machine Learning Force Fields Without Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24115)
*Evan Dramko,Yihuang Xiong,Yizhi Zhu,Geoffroy Hautier,Thomas Reps,Christopher Jermaine,Anastasios Kyrillidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces ADAPT, a Transformer-based machine-learning force field designed to efficiently compute defect energetics and structures, outperforming existing graph neural network methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of graph neural networks (oversmoothing and poor representation of long-range interactions) in modeling point defects in materials, given their computational expense.

Method: ADAPT utilizes a Transformer encoder that models interactions directly through a coordinates-in-space formulation and considers explicit pairwise atomic interactions. Atoms are treated as tokens for interaction modeling.

Result: ADAPT demonstrates a 33% reduction in force and energy prediction errors compared to GNN-based models while maintaining lower computational costs.

Conclusion: ADAPT provides an efficient and accurate alternative for computing material defect properties, leveraging advanced Transformer-based methods to overcome GNN shortcomings.

Abstract: Point defects play a central role in driving the properties of materials.
First-principles methods are widely used to compute defect energetics and
structures, including at scale for high-throughput defect databases. However,
these methods are computationally expensive, making machine-learning force
fields (MLFFs) an attractive alternative for accelerating structural
relaxations. Most existing MLFFs are based on graph neural networks (GNNs),
which can suffer from oversmoothing and poor representation of long-range
interactions. Both of these issues are especially of concern when modeling
point defects. To address these challenges, we introduce the Accelerated Deep
Atomic Potential Transformer (ADAPT), an MLFF that replaces graph
representations with a direct coordinates-in-space formulation and explicitly
considers all pairwise atomic interactions. Atoms are treated as tokens, with a
Transformer encoder modeling their interactions. Applied to a dataset of
silicon point defects, ADAPT achieves a roughly 33 percent reduction in both
force and energy prediction errors relative to a state-of-the-art GNN-based
model, while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost.

*Md Mozaharul Mottalib,Thao-Ly T. Phan,Rahmatollah Beheshti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyMaTE, a hybrid model combining strengths of Mamba (an SSM) and Transformer models to represent EHR data better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex nature of electronic health records (EHRs) challenges deep learning, demanding efficient, scalable methods.

Method: HyMaTE integrates State Space Models and Transformers for channel-level and sequence-level data processing.

Result: Demonstrates improved efficiency and nuanced representation on predictive tasks using multiple clinical datasets.

Conclusion: HyMaTE is scalable, interpretable, and generalizable, offering a robust solution for real-world healthcare applications.

Abstract: Electronic health Records (EHRs) have become a cornerstone in modern-day
healthcare. They are a crucial part for analyzing the progression of patient
health; however, their complexity, characterized by long, multivariate
sequences, sparsity, and missing values poses significant challenges in
traditional deep learning modeling. While Transformer-based models have
demonstrated success in modeling EHR data and predicting clinical outcomes,
their quadratic computational complexity and limited context length hinder
their efficiency and practical applications. On the other hand, State Space
Models (SSMs) like Mamba present a promising alternative offering linear-time
sequence modeling and improved efficiency for handling long sequences, but
focus mostly on mixing sequence-level information rather than channel-level
data. To overcome these challenges, we propose HyMaTE (A Hybrid Mamba and
Transformer Model for EHR Representation Learning), a novel hybrid model
tailored for representing longitudinal data, combining the strengths of SSMs
with advanced attention mechanisms. By testing the model on predictive tasks on
multiple clinical datasets, we demonstrate HyMaTE's ability to capture an
effective, richer, and more nuanced unified representation of EHR data.
Additionally, the interpretability of the outcomes achieved by self-attention
illustrates the effectiveness of our model as a scalable and generalizable
solution for real-world healthcare applications. Codes are available at:

### [921] [Echo Flow Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24122)
*Hongbo Liu,Jia Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Echo Flow Networks (EFNs), a framework to improve time-series forecasting through extended Echo State Networks (X-ESNs) with enhanced computational efficiency and prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of capturing long-range temporal dependencies efficiently in time-series forecasting, as conventional deep learning models struggle with balancing computational complexity and information retention.

Method: The method combines extended Echo State Networks (X-ESNs) with MLP readouts, incorporates a Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation (MCRA), and proposes a dual-stream architecture to improve temporal dynamics and representation.

Result: EFNs demonstrate up to 4x faster training and 3x smaller model size than leading methods like PatchTST, with a significant forecasting error reduction from 43% to 35%. EchoFormer achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: EFNs represent an advancement in time-series forecasting by combining efficiency, expanded representational capacity, and improved accuracy, showcasing their potential over traditional and contemporary forecasting methods.

Abstract: At the heart of time-series forecasting (TSF) lies a fundamental challenge:
how can models efficiently and effectively capture long-range temporal
dependencies across ever-growing sequences? While deep learning has brought
notable progress, conventional architectures often face a trade-off between
computational complexity and their ability to retain accumulative information
over extended horizons.
  Echo State Networks (ESNs), a class of reservoir computing models, have
recently regained attention for their exceptional efficiency, offering constant
memory usage and per-step training complexity regardless of input length. This
makes them particularly attractive for modeling extremely long-term event
history in TSF. However, traditional ESNs fall short of state-of-the-art
performance due to their limited nonlinear capacity, which constrains both
their expressiveness and stability.
  We introduce Echo Flow Networks (EFNs), a framework composed of a group of
extended Echo State Networks (X-ESNs) with MLP readouts, enhanced by our novel
Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation (MCRA), which enables complex,
neuron-specific temporal dynamics, significantly expanding the network's
representational capacity without compromising computational efficiency. In
addition, we propose a dual-stream architecture in which recent input history
dynamically selects signature reservoir features from an infinite-horizon
memory, leading to improved prediction accuracy and long-term stability.
  Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks demonstrate that EFNs achieve up to
4x faster training and 3x smaller model size compared to leading methods like
PatchTST, reducing forecasting error from 43% to 35%, a 20% relative
improvement. One instantiation of our framework, EchoFormer, consistently
achieves new state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets: ETTh,
ETTm, DMV, Weather, and Air Quality.

### [922] [The Impossibility of Inverse Permutation Learning in Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24125)
*Rohan Alur,Chris Hays,Manish Raghavan,Devavrat Shah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores why decoder-only transformers cannot solve the inverse permutation task and proposes two feasible constructions for addressing this limitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand why decoder-only transformers fail to learn inverse permutation tasks and to highlight its implications for reasoning tasks like long-context retrieval, QA, and in-context learning.

Method: The authors demonstrate an impossibility result for the task using theoretical analysis, then propose two alternative constructions based on causal attention masks and scratch tokens.

Result: They show that decoder-only models lack the expressive capacity to solve such tasks, but these limitations can be addressed with causal attention masks or by padding input with neutral scratch tokens.

Conclusion: The findings indicate key architectural limitations in decoder-only transformers, while offering insights into mechanisms (e.g., scratch tokens) that could improve reasoning in large language models.

Abstract: In this technical note, we study the problem of inverse permutation learning
in decoder-only transformers. Given a permutation and a string to which that
permutation has been applied, the model is tasked with producing the original
(``canonical'') string. We argue that this task models a natural robustness
property across a variety of reasoning tasks, including long-context retrieval,
multiple choice QA and in-context learning. Our primary contribution is an
impossibility result: we show that an arbitrary depth, decoder-only transformer
cannot learn this task. This result concerns the expressive capacity of
decoder-only transformer models and is agnostic to training dynamics or sample
complexity. We give a pair of alternative constructions under which inverse
permutation learning is feasible. The first of these highlights the fundamental
role of the causal attention mask, and reveals a gap between the expressivity
of encoder-decoder transformers and the more popular decoder-only architecture.
The latter result is more surprising: we show that simply padding the input
with ``scratch tokens" yields a construction under which inverse permutation
learning is possible. We conjecture that this may suggest an alternative
mechanism by which chain-of-thought prompting or, more generally, intermediate
``thinking'' tokens can enable reasoning in large language models, even when
these tokens encode no meaningful semantic information (e.g., the results of
intermediate computations).

*Ethan Zachary Lo,Dan Chie-Tien Lo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a machine learning-based forecasting model for predicting tropical cyclone features and status, achieving superior accuracy and precision compared to traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in traditional cyclone forecasting methods, which are computationally expensive and struggle with errors due to atmospheric chaos.

Method: A two-stage machine learning pipeline is used, combining regression to predict cyclone trajectory features and classification models (RF, SVM, MLP) to forecast cyclone statuses.

Result: The random forest classifier achieves 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP models, with strong prediction results for pressure and wind within 2.2 mb and 2.4 kt.

Conclusion: Machine learning models, especially ensemble classifiers like RF, provide an effective and scalable alternative for real-time cyclone forecasting.

Abstract: Accurate cyclone forecasting is essential for minimizing loss of life,
infrastructure damage, and economic disruption. Traditional numerical weather
prediction models, though effective, are computationally intensive and prone to
error due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. This study proposes a
machine learning (ML) approach to forecasting tropical cyclone trajectory and
status using time series data from the National Hurricane Center, including
recently added best track wind radii. A two-stage ML pipeline is developed: a
regression model first predicts cyclone features maximum wind speed, minimum
pressure, trajectory length, and directional change using a sliding window of
historical data. These outputs are then input into classification models to
predict the cyclone's categorical status. Gradient boosting regression and
three classifiers random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and
multilayer perceptron (MLP) are evaluated. After hyperparameter tuning and
synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE), the RF classifier achieves the highest
performance with 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP across precision,
recall, and F1 score. The RF model is particularly robust in identifying
minority cyclone statuses and minimizing false negatives. Regression results
yield low mean absolute errors, with pressure and wind predictions within about
2.2 mb and 2.4 kt, respectively. These findings demonstrate that ML models,
especially ensemble-based classifiers, offer an effective, scalable alternative
to traditional forecasting methods, with potential for real-time cyclone
prediction and integration into decision support systems.

*Arpit Garg,Hemanth Saratchandran,Ravi Garg,Simon Lucey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies instability in machine unlearning methods due to unbounded weight growth and proposes a stable, parameter-efficient solution using bounded functions to improve forgetting and retention in Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability and unreliability of existing machine unlearning methods in large language models, specifically stemming from unbounded growth of weights and gradients in gradient difference methods.

Method: The authors propose 'Bounded Parameter-Efficient Unlearning,' which applies bounded functions within LoRA-based fine-tuning, stabilizing the gradient difference method during optimization by controlling weight dynamics.

Result: The proposed method achieves significant improvements in forgetting and retention across various benchmarks (TOFU, TDEC, MUSE) and model scales (125M to 8B parameters).

Conclusion: The paper establishes a theoretically grounded and practically scalable framework for machine unlearning in LLMs, solving prior stability issues and enhancing performance across diverse settings.

Abstract: Machine unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is essential for privacy
and safety; however, existing approaches remain unstable and unreliable. A
widely used strategy, the gradient difference method, applies gradient descent
on retained data while performing gradient ascent on forget data, the data
whose influence should be removed. However, when combined with cross-entropy
loss, this procedure causes unbounded growth of weights and gradients, leading
to training instability and degrading both forgetting and retention. We provide
a theoretical framework that explains this failure, explicitly showing how
ascent on the forget set destabilizes optimization in the feedforward MLP
layers of LLMs. Guided by this insight, we propose Bounded Parameter-Efficient
Unlearning, a parameter-efficient approach that stabilizes LoRA-based
fine-tuning by applying bounded functions to MLP adapters. This simple
modification controls the weight dynamics during ascent, enabling the gradient
difference method to converge reliably. Across the TOFU, TDEC, and MUSE
benchmarks, and across architectures and scales from 125M to 8B parameters, our
method achieves substantial improvements in forgetting while preserving
retention, establishing a novel theoretically grounded and practically scalable
framework for unlearning in LLMs.

*Qipeng Zhan,Zhuoping Zhou,Zexuan Wang,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAE introduces an asymmetric architecture to autoencoders, preserving both local and global geometric structures in data simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoencoder methods struggle to balance local and global geometric properties in the latent space, leading to suboptimal data representation.

Method: MAE employs an asymmetric architecture with global distance constraints applied to the encoder and local geometric constraints applied to the decoder.

Result: MAE consistently outperformed existing methods on synthetic and real-world datasets across various metrics.

Conclusion: MAE effectively addresses the challenge of maintaining both local and global geometric structures in autoencoders, enabling superior data representation and dimensionality reduction.

Abstract: Autoencoders have emerged as powerful models for visualization and
dimensionality reduction based on the fundamental assumption that
high-dimensional data is generated from a low-dimensional manifold. A critical
challenge in autoencoder design is to preserve the geometric structure of data
in the latent space, with existing approaches typically focusing on either
global or local geometric properties separately. Global approaches often
encounter errors in distance approximation that accumulate, while local methods
frequently converge to suboptimal solutions that distort large-scale
relationships. We propose Multi-Scale Geometric Autoencoder (MAE), which
introduces an asymmetric architecture that simultaneously preserves both scales
of the geometric structure by applying global distance constraints to the
encoder and local geometric constraints to the decoder. Through theoretical
analysis, we establish that this asymmetric design aligns naturally with the
distinct roles of the encoder and decoder components. Our comprehensive
experiments on both synthetic manifolds and real-world datasets demonstrate
that MAE consistently outperforms existing methods across various evaluation
metrics.

*Ruibo Chen,Sheng Zhang,Yihan Wu,Tong Zheng,Peihua Mai,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Random Selection Probing (RSP), a statistical framework for detecting correlations between large language models and vision-language models, producing rigorous p-values for fine-tuned relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reliable techniques to determine the relationships or similarity between machine learning models, given the increasing prevalence of fine-tuned or derivative models.

Method: Developing Random Selection Probing (RSP), which optimizes prefixes in a reference model and assesses their transferability to target models using statistical hypothesis testing and comparison against baseline models.

Result: RSP consistently identified model correlations with low p-values for related models and high p-values for unrelated ones, validated across diverse models and access conditions.

Conclusion: RSP establishes itself as a robust, principled, and interpretable framework for detecting model correlations, mitigating false positives and providing transparent evaluation in machine learning ecosystems.

Abstract: The growing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language
models (VLMs) has heightened the need for reliable techniques to determine
whether a model has been fine-tuned from or is even identical to another.
Existing similarity-based methods often require access to model parameters or
produce heuristic scores without principled thresholds, limiting their
applicability. We introduce Random Selection Probing (RSP), a
hypothesis-testing framework that formulates model correlation detection as a
statistical test. RSP optimizes textual or visual prefixes on a reference model
for a random selection task and evaluates their transferability to a target
model, producing rigorous p-values that quantify evidence of correlation. To
mitigate false positives, RSP incorporates an unrelated baseline model to
filter out generic, transferable features. We evaluate RSP across both LLMs and
VLMs under diverse access conditions for reference models and test models.
Experiments on fine-tuned and open-source models show that RSP consistently
yields small p-values for related models while maintaining high p-values for
unrelated ones. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness
of RSP. These results establish RSP as the first principled and general
statistical framework for model correlation detection, enabling transparent and
interpretable decisions in modern machine learning ecosystems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FM-FoG, a wearable system, detects Freezing-of-Gait (FoG) in Parkinson's patients using a foundation model approach without requiring patient-specific training. It achieves high accuracy and energy efficiency for unseen patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FoG detection systems require extensive patient-specific training data and lack generalization, limiting clinical deployment and effectiveness across Parkinson’s disease patients.

Method: The paper introduces FM-FoG, a wearable system leveraging self-supervised learning on diverse IMU datasets and sensor context integration. A lightweight CNN-LSTM activity classifier ensures the model operates only during relevant activities, reducing computational demands.

Result: FM-FoG achieves 98.5% F1-score on unseen patients, outperforming baseline methods. When deployed on a smartphone, it reduces battery usage by 72% and maintains intervention latency under 20ms.

Conclusion: FM-FoG offers a practical and energy-efficient solution for real-time FoG detection in Parkinson’s patients, generalizing across individuals without patient-specific training requirements.

Abstract: Freezing-of-Gait (FoG) affects over 50% of mid-to-late stage Parkinson's
disease (PD) patients, significantly impairing patients' mobility independence
and reducing quality of life. FoG is characterized by sudden episodes where
walking cannot start or is interrupted, occurring exclusively during standing
or walking, and never while sitting or lying down. Current FoG detection
systems require extensive patient-specific training data and lack
generalization, limiting clinical deployment. To address these issues, we
introduce FM-FoG, a real-time foundation model-based wearable system achieving
FoG detection in unseen patients without patient-specific training. Our
approach combines self-supervised pretraining on diverse Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) datasets with sensor context integration. Since FoG occurs only
during ambulatory activities, a lightweight CNN-LSTM activity classifier
selectively activates the foundation model only during walking or standing,
avoiding unnecessary computation. Evaluated on the VCU FoG-IMU dataset with 23
PD patients, FM-FoG achieves a 98.5% F1-score when tested on previously unseen
patients, substantially outperforming competitive baseline methods. Deployed on
a Google Pixel 8a smartphone, the system extends battery life by up to 72%
while maintaining sub-20ms intervention latency. The results indicate that our
FM-FoG can enable practical, energy-efficient healthcare applications that
generalize across patients without individual training requirements.

### [928] [Negative Pre-activations Differentiate Syntax](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24198)
*Linghao Kong,Angelina Ning,Micah Adler,Nir Shavit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Wasserstein neurons in large language models are essential for syntax differentiation and grammatical behavior, despite being few in number.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discover the critical contributions of Wasserstein neurons to syntax differentiation in language models.

Method: Analyzed negative pre-activation behavior and syntactic token interactions, performed ablation experiments on these neurons.

Result: Removing negative pre-activations of certain neurons disrupted grammatical behavior and highlighted their role in syntax processing.

Conclusion: Sparse Wasserstein neurons play a functional role in syntax by driving differentiation in negative pre-activation spaces, crucial for performance across layers and training.

Abstract: A recently discovered class of entangled neurons, known as Wasserstein
neurons, is disproportionately critical in large language models despite
constituting only a very small fraction of the network: their targeted removal
collapses the model, consistent with their unique role in differentiating
similar inputs. Interestingly, in Wasserstein neurons immediately preceding
smooth activation functions, such differentiation manifests in the negative
pre-activation space, especially in early layers. Pairs of similar inputs are
driven to highly distinct negative values, and these pairs involve syntactic
tokens such as determiners and prepositions. We show that this negative region
is functional rather than simply favorable for optimization. A minimal,
sign-specific intervention that zeroes only the negative pre-activations of a
small subset of entangled neurons significantly weakens overall model function
and disrupts grammatical behavior, while both random and perplexity-matched
controls leave grammatical performance largely unchanged. Part of speech
analysis localizes the excess surprisal to syntactic scaffolding tokens, and
layer-specific interventions reveal that small local degradations accumulate
across depth. Over training checkpoints, the same ablation impairs grammatical
behavior as Wasserstein neurons emerge and stabilize. Together, these results
identify negative differentiation in a sparse subset of entangled neurons as a
crucial mechanism that language models rely on for syntax.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenges in applying reinforcement learning to large language models, particularly off-policy settings, due to real-world constraints and the need for innovation.

Method: Through first-principles derivation, the authors adapt REINFORCE to off-policy settings by introducing regularization of policy updates and actively shaping data distribution.

Result: The analysis provides theoretical grounding for recent algorithms, highlights the misconceptions around certain RL techniques, and validates the proposed approaches through empirical studies.

Conclusion: The work offers actionable insights and opens up new pathways for principled off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms for large language models.

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is
attracting growing interest, driven by practical constraints in real-world
applications, the complexity of LLM-RL infrastructure, and the need for further
innovations of RL methodologies. While classic REINFORCE and its modern
variants like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) are typically regarded
as on-policy algorithms with limited tolerance of off-policyness, we present in
this work a first-principles derivation for group-relative REINFORCE without
assuming a specific training data distribution, showing that it admits a native
off-policy interpretation. This perspective yields two general principles for
adapting REINFORCE to off-policy settings: regularizing policy updates, and
actively shaping the data distribution. Our analysis demystifies some myths
about the roles of importance sampling and clipping in GRPO, unifies and
reinterprets two recent algorithms -- Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) and
Asymmetric REINFORCE (AsymRE) -- as regularized forms of the REINFORCE loss,
and offers theoretical justification for seemingly heuristic data-weighting
strategies. Our findings lead to actionable insights that are validated with
extensive empirical studies, and open up new opportunities for principled
algorithm design in off-policy RL for LLMs. Source code for this work is

### [930] [MDD-Thinker: Towards Large Reasoning Models for Major Depressive Disorder Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24217)
*Yuyang Sha,Hongxin Pan,Gang Luo,Caijuan Shi,Jing Wang,Kefeng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MDD-Thinker, a language model for diagnosing depression, which outperforms traditional and modern baselines in accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency of diagnosing Major Depressive Disorder, beyond the limitations of subjective assessments and traditional methods.

Method: Developed an LLM framework called MDD-Thinker using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Trained on 50,000 reasoning samples from clinical and mental health datasets and compared against various diagnostic models.

Result: MDD-Thinker achieved superior accuracy (0.8268) and F1-score (0.8081) compared to other models, demonstrating significant gains in diagnostic performance and reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: MDD-Thinker offers a scalable, efficient, and interpretability-focused diagnostic framework, with potential applications for broader mental health care diagnostics.

Abstract: Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global
disability, yet current diagnostic approaches often rely on subjective
assessments and lack the ability to integrate multimodal clinical information.
Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy
through advanced reasoning but face challenges in interpretability,
hallucination, and reliance on synthetic data.
  Methods We developed MDD-Thinker, an LLM-based diagnostic framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
strengthen reasoning ability and interpretability. Using the UK Biobank
dataset, we generated 40,000 reasoning samples, supplemented with 10,000
samples from publicly available mental health datasets. The model was
fine-tuned on these reasoning corpora, and its diagnostic and reasoning
performance was evaluated against machine learning, deep learning, and
state-of-the-art LLM baselines.
  Findings MDD-Thinker achieved an accuracy of 0.8268 and F1-score of 0.8081,
significantly outperforming traditional baselines such as SVM and MLP, as well
as general-purpose LLMs. Incorporating both SFT and RL yielded the greatest
improvements, with relative gains of 29.0% in accuracy, 38.1% in F1-score, and
34.8% in AUC. Moreover, the model demonstrated comparable reasoning performance
compared to much larger LLMs, while maintaining computational efficiency.
  Interpretation This study presents the first reasoning-enhanced LLM framework
for MDD diagnosis trained on large-scale real-world clinical data. By
integrating SFT and RL, MDD-Thinker balances accuracy, interpretability, and
efficiency, offering a scalable approach for intelligent psychiatric
diagnostics. These findings suggest that reasoning-oriented LLMs can provide
clinically reliable support for MDD detection and may inform broader
applications in mental health care.

### [931] [CAOTE: KV Cache Selection for LLMs via Attention Output Error-Based Token Eviction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14051)
*Raghavv Goel,Junyoung Park,Mukul Gagrani,Dalton Jones,Matthew Morse,Harper Langston,Mingu Lee,Chris Lott*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAOTE, a token eviction method that combines attention scores and value vectors to enhance performance in resource-constrained devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory and computational limits impede large language models' efficiency, especially in low-resource scenarios. Current token eviction methods inadequately assess token importance due to reliance on attention scores alone.

Method: CAOTE calculates token importance by integrating attention scores with value vectors, optimizing eviction error. It can enhance other eviction methods and allows flexible application.

Result: CAOTE improves downstream task accuracy when paired with state-of-the-art token eviction methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in leveraging value information.

Conclusion: By integrating value vectors with attention scores, CAOTE provides a novel and more effective approach to token eviction in resource-restricted environments.

Abstract: While long context support of large language models has extended their
abilities, it also incurs challenges in memory and compute which becomes
crucial bottlenecks in resource-restricted devices. Token eviction, a widely
adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by
evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores
as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of
attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the
information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this
paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of
cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction
error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and
value vectors. This is the first method which uses value tokens on top of
attention-based eviction scores in closed-form. Additionally, CAOTE can act as
a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We
show that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based
methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the
importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.

*Junjie Wang,Pan Zhou,Yiming Dong,Huan Li,Jia Li,Xun Zhou,Qicheng Lao,Cong Fang,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Conda optimizer, which combines improved spectral conditioning and coordinate-wise adaptivity to enhance training efficiency for large language models (LLMs). Experiments show it significantly outperforms existing optimizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses inefficiencies in large language model (LLM) pre-training, where existing optimizers like Adam face limitations in spectral conditioning while alternative methods like Muon lack coordinate-wise adaptivity.

Method: The proposed optimizer, Column-Normalized Adam (Conda), achieves effective spectral normalization by projecting updates into an orthogonal subspace and applying column-wise second moment normalization. This ensures improved spectral conditioning and retains coordinate-wise adaptivity.

Result: Conda consistently outperforms AdamW, Muon, and other baselines in pre-training efficiency. It achieves a 2-2.5× speedup in convergence on the LLaMA series, evaluated in both training steps and overall training time.

Conclusion: Conda emerges as a robust and effective optimizer for LLM training, combining the benefits of spectral normalization with fast convergence. It is broadly applicable for large-scale model training scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization and
emergent capabilities, yet their pre-training remains computationally expensive
and sensitive to optimization dynamics. While Adam-based optimizers offer fast
convergence by adapting learning rates coordinate-wise, recent studies reveal
that their updates often suffer from poor spectral conditioning and low-rank
structures, hindering efficiency. Muon addresses this issue via global spectral
normalization but lacks the per-coordinate adaptivity of Adam. In this work, we
propose \textbf{Column-Normalized Adam (Conda)}, a novel optimizer that bridges
the strengths of both approaches. Conda projects updates into an orthogonal
subspace and applies column-wise second moment normalization based on the
projected gradients, thereby achieving both improved spectral conditioning and
maintaining coordinate-wise adaptivity. This design alleviates the spectral
pathologies of Adam while preserving its fast convergence behavior. Extensive
experiments on the LLaMA and GPT-2 series show that Conda consistently
outperforms AdamW, Muon, and other baselines in pre-training. Remarkably, on
the LLaMA series, \textbf{Conda achieves $2{\sim}2.5\times$ the convergence
speed of AdamW, measured in both training steps and training time.} Further
ablations demonstrate its robustness under diverse training setups. These
results collectively highlight Conda as an effective and broadly applicable
optimizer for large-scale LLM training. The code is released on

### [933] [Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models:Toward Joint Visualization of Interactive and Independent Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21923)
*Fumin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new model called Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs) that enhances interpretability and predictive power compared to existing models like GAMs and CESR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models in high-stakes fields like healthcare require interpretability. While GAMs achieve this, they sacrifice predictive performance by excluding higher-order interactions, prompting the need for a better alternative.

Method: The paper proposes MACMs, a hybrid model combining multiplicative (CESR) and additive (GAMs) components to capture both higher-order interactions and individual feature effects while maintaining visual interpretability through shape functions.

Result: Experiments show that neural network-based MACMs outperform both CESR and state-of-the-art GAMs in predictive accuracy while retaining interpretability.

Conclusion: MACMs advance the balance between interpretability and predictive performance, addressing limitations in current GAMs and CESR methods.

Abstract: Interpretability is one of the considerations when applying machine learning
to high-stakes fields such as healthcare that involve matters of life safety.
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing
shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit
higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes
significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve
Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the
visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both
interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless,
CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce
Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an
additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive
and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The
model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape
functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in
interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process.
Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The
experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly
outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of
predictive performance.

*Ashiqur Rahman,Hamed Alhoori*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an API-based framework to integrate machine learning in industrial systems without major hardware upgrades, reducing costs and disruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning integration faces barriers in manufacturing industries due to the high costs of upgrading legacy systems and supporting the ML lifecycle, especially for small and medium enterprises.

Method: The authors propose an API-based framework that separates the ML model lifecycle from production systems, accessed via a lightweight browser interface requiring no hardware upgrades.

Result: The framework offers interactive control of ML models to domain experts, maintaining production uptime while enabling trust and seamless adoption.

Conclusion: The solution is scalable, accessible, and reduces risks, thereby improving manufacturing quality, safety, and competitiveness.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) is critical for industrial
competitiveness, yet its adoption is frequently stalled by the prohibitive
costs and operational disruptions of upgrading legacy systems. The financial
and logistical overhead required to support the full ML lifecycle presents a
formidable barrier to widespread implementation, particularly for small and
medium-sized enterprises. This paper introduces a pragmatic, API-based
framework designed to overcome these challenges by strategically decoupling the
ML model lifecycle from the production environment. Our solution delivers the
analytical power of ML to domain experts through a lightweight, browser-based
interface, eliminating the need for local hardware upgrades and ensuring model
maintenance can occur with zero production downtime. This human-in-the-loop
approach empowers experts with interactive control over model parameters,
fostering trust and facilitating seamless integration into existing workflows.
By mitigating the primary financial and operational risks, this framework
offers a scalable and accessible pathway to enhance production quality and
safety, thereby strengthening the competitive advantage of the manufacturing
sector.

### [935] [Accessible, Realistic, and Fair Evaluation of Positive-Unlabeled Learning Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24228)
*Wei Wang,Dong-Dong Wu,Ming Li,Jingxiong Zhang,Gang Niu,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes the first benchmark framework specifically designed to compare different Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning algorithms systematically and fairly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inconsistent experimental settings make it difficult to compare the performance of various PU learning algorithms objectively.

Method: The authors systematically investigated model selection criteria, addressed issues like validation requiring negative data, and proposed a calibration approach to resolve label shift challenges in one-sample settings while ensuring balanced evaluations across different problem families.

Result: The framework identifies critical evaluation issues in PU learning, such as internal label shifts and reliance on unrealistic validation sets, offering improvements for fairer algorithm comparisons.

Conclusion: This benchmark provides a structured and realistic system to evaluate PU learning algorithms systematically, aiming to standardize future comparisons and drive advancements in the field.

Abstract: Positive-unlabeled (PU) learning is a weakly supervised binary classification
problem, in which the goal is to learn a binary classifier from only positive
and unlabeled data, without access to negative data. In recent years, many PU
learning algorithms have been developed to improve model performance. However,
experimental settings are highly inconsistent, making it difficult to identify
which algorithm performs better. In this paper, we propose the first PU
learning benchmark to systematically compare PU learning algorithms. During our
implementation, we identify subtle yet critical factors that affect the
realistic and fair evaluation of PU learning algorithms. On the one hand, many
PU learning algorithms rely on a validation set that includes negative data for
model selection. This is unrealistic in traditional PU learning settings, where
no negative data are available. To handle this problem, we systematically
investigate model selection criteria for PU learning. On the other hand, the
problem settings and solutions of PU learning have different families, i.e.,
the one-sample and two-sample settings. However, existing evaluation protocols
are heavily biased towards the one-sample setting and neglect the significant
difference between them. We identify the internal label shift problem of
unlabeled training data for the one-sample setting and propose a simple yet
effective calibration approach to ensure fair comparisons within and across
families. We hope our framework will provide an accessible, realistic, and fair
environment for evaluating PU learning algorithms in the future.

*Jincheng Liu,Sijun He,Jingjing Wu,Xiangsen Wang,Yang Chen,Zhaoqi Kuang,Siqi Bao,Yuan Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChessArena, a testbed to assess LLMs' strategic reasoning through chess gameplay, revealing shortcomings in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to determine whether LLMs possess genuine strategic reasoning skills or primarily rely on recognizing patterns in their training data.

Method: The authors develop ChessArena, a competitive framework for LLMs to play chess under four modes, equipped with ranking and evaluation systems. Over 13 LLMs are tested in 800+ games.

Result: The experiments show that none of the LLMs surpassed Maia-1100, with some models failing against a random move generator.

Conclusion: Current LLMs exhibit significant limitations in strategic reasoning, but fine-tuning methods, such as applied in Qwen3-8B, can enhance their performance.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities.
However, a critical question remains: do these models possess genuine reasoning
skills particularly complex strategic reasoning or are they primarily excelling
at sophisticated pattern recognition within their training data? To address
this question, this paper presents a chess testbed, ChessArena, to evaluate the
strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Chess requires complex strategic
reasoning capabilities including long-term planning, strict rule comprehension,
and multi-turn conversation memorization. Specifically, ChessArena is a
competitive framework where LLMs play against each other, under four different
play modes. The testbed is equipped with a ranking algorithm and a leaderboard.
The testbed can also evaluate fine-grained capabilities including basic
understanding, move selection, and puzzle solving. Over 13 LLMs with different
modes are evaluated in ChessArena, playing over 800 games. The results reveal
significant shortcomings in current LLMs: no model can beat Maia-1100 (a chess
engine at human amateur level), while some even failed to defeat a random
player that selects moves arbitrarily. We also present a strong baseline to the
testbed: our fine-tuned Qwen3-8B substantially improved performance,
approaching much larger state-of-the-art reasoning models.

*Yunhao Liang,Pujun Zhang,Yuan Qu,Shaochong Lin,Zuo-jun Max Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Graph Foundation Model (GFM), using pretrain-transfer concepts for solving diverse graph-based optimization problems efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend the pretrain-transfer framework of large language models to graph-based Operations Research (OR) problems which face combinatorial constraints.

Method: Developed GFM that uses self-supervised pre-training on paths from random walks in graphs to learn structure and connectivity as supervisory signals.

Result: GFM demonstrated competitive performance in optimization tasks across graphs of different sizes, with faster inference times compared to specialized solvers.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for applying foundation model principles to graph-based optimization in Operations Research.

Abstract: The pretrain-transfer paradigm, which underpins the success of large language
models (LLMs), has demonstrated the immense power of creating foundation models
that learn generalizable representations from vast datasets. However, extending
this paradigm to Operations Research (OR) problems on graph structures remains
challenging due to the fundamental conflict between the statistical flexibility
of language and the strict combinatorial constraints of graphs. To bridge this
gap, we introduce the Graph Foundation Model (GFM), the first framework capable
of solving all distance-based optimization problems on graph structures. By
introducing the LLM-like self-supervised pre-training paradigm on the paths
generated from random walks in the graph, GFM is compelled to internalize the
graph's complex topological and combinatorial rules, where the connectivity of
the structure itself can be treated as the supervisory signal. Unlike existing
neural methods that learn complex and task-specific solving policies, our
approach leverages the pre-trained GFM as a foundational model of the graph's
intrinsic structure, which in turn enables a simple generative heuristic to
tackle a diverse range of optimization challenges effectively. Comprehensive
experiments on networks ranging from 20 to 893 nodes demonstrate that GFM
achieves competitive performance against specialized solvers across a variety
of distinct optimization task classes, while maintaining significantly faster
inference times. Our work establishes a new paradigm of adapting the
pretrain-transfer framework to graph optimization, opening the door for
applying foundation model innovations to OR.

*Inkyu Park,Jeong-Gwan Lee,Taehwan Kwon,Juheon Choi,Seungku Kim,Junsu Kim,Kimin Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a simulation framework for modeling and detecting Extra-Sensory Perception (ESP) cheats in games, focusing on adaptive cheater behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting ESP cheats in games is difficult due to the lack of observable evidence and cheaters' ability to adapt their behavior.

Method: The authors proposed using reinforcement learning agents to simulate cheaters and non-cheaters, and trajectory-based classifiers to detect cheats. They model the cheater-detector interactions as an adversarial game.

Result: The framework successfully simulates adaptive cheater behaviors, demonstrating strategic balance between reward optimization and detection evasion.

Conclusion: This proposed simulation framework aids in studying adaptive cheating behaviors and contributes to the development of more effective cheat detectors.

Abstract: Extra-Sensory Perception (ESP) cheats, which reveal hidden in-game
information such as enemy locations, are difficult to detect because their
effects are not directly observable in player behavior. The lack of observable
evidence makes it difficult to collect reliably labeled data, which is
essential for training effective anti-cheat systems. Furthermore, cheaters
often adapt their behavior by limiting or disguising their cheat usage, which
further complicates detection and detector development. To address these
challenges, we propose a simulation framework for controlled modeling of ESP
cheaters, non-cheaters, and trajectory-based detectors. We model cheaters and
non-cheaters as reinforcement learning agents with different levels of
observability, while detectors classify their behavioral trajectories. Next, we
formulate the interaction between the cheater and the detector as an
adversarial game, allowing both players to co-adapt over time. To reflect
realistic cheater strategies, we introduce a structured cheater model that
dynamically switches between cheating and non-cheating behaviors based on
detection risk. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully
simulates adaptive cheater behaviors that strategically balance reward
optimization and detection evasion. This work provides a controllable and
extensible platform for studying adaptive cheating behaviors and developing
effective cheat detectors.

TL;DR: ELASTIQ improves EEG representation learning by integrating language instructions as semantic constraints, enhancing decoding and transferability across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EEG models struggle with incorporating language instructions, limiting their ability to unify EEG tasks using semantic knowledge.

Method: ELASTIQ combines a joint Spectral-Temporal Reconstruction (STR) module for pretraining with an Instruction-conditioned Q-Former (IQF) mechanism for instruction tuning.

Result: ELASTIQ achieves state-of-the-art results on 14 out of 20 EEG datasets across various tasks, showing robust decoding and transferability.

Conclusion: Explicit task instructions provide powerful semantic priors for EEG embeddings, leading to coherent and linguistically structured representations.

Abstract: Recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models, which
capture transferable EEG representations, have greatly accelerated the
development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). However, existing approaches
still struggle to incorporate language instructions as prior constraints for
EEG representation learning, limiting their ability to leverage the semantic
knowledge inherent in language to unify different labels and tasks. To address
this challenge, we present ELASTIQ, a foundation model for EEG-Language
Alignment with Semantic Task Instruction and Querying. ELASTIQ integrates
task-aware semantic guidance to produce structured and linguistically aligned
EEG embeddings, thereby enhancing decoding robustness and transferability. In
the pretraining stage, we introduce a joint Spectral-Temporal Reconstruction
(STR) module, which combines frequency masking as a global spectral
perturbation with two complementary temporal objectives: random masking to
capture contextual dependencies and causal masking to model sequential
dynamics. In the instruction tuning stage, we propose the
Instruction-conditioned Q-Former (IQF), a query-based cross-attention
transformer that injects instruction embeddings into EEG tokens and aligns them
with textual label embeddings through learnable queries. We evaluate ELASTIQ on
20 datasets spanning motor imagery, emotion recognition, steady-state visual
evoked potentials, covert speech, and healthcare tasks. ELASTIQ achieves
state-of-the-art performance on 14 of the 20 datasets and obtains the best
average results across all five task categories. Importantly, our analyses
reveal for the first time that explicit task instructions serve as semantic
priors guiding EEG embeddings into coherent and linguistically grounded spaces.
The code and pre-trained weights will be released.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a new Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) framework based on Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) for predicting Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) dynamics, exploring its performance across various noise scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) plays a crucial role in soil health and climate resilience, yet its prediction is challenging due to the complex interplay of physical, chemical, and biological processes.

Method: The study develops UDEs combining mechanistic physics like advection-diffusion transport with neural networks that learn microbial production and respiration patterns, validated via synthetic datasets under varying noise conditions.

Result: In noise-free and moderate noise scenarios, the UDE approach demonstrated high accuracy (MSE = 1.6e-5, R2 = 0.9999 in clean cases). However, it struggled with high noise conditions (35%), showing overfitting and failure to capture variability.

Conclusion: While UDEs show promise for SOC forecasting, their effectiveness in high-noise conditions is limited, indicating a need for noise-aware loss functions, probabilistic modeling, and enhanced integration of microbial dynamics for field applications.

Abstract: Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is a foundation of soil health and global climate
resilience, yet its prediction remains difficult because of intricate physical,
chemical, and biological processes. In this study, we explore a Scientific
Machine Learning (SciML) framework built on Universal Differential Equations
(UDEs) to forecast SOC dynamics across soil depth and time. UDEs blend
mechanistic physics, such as advection diffusion transport, with neural
networks that learn nonlinear microbial production and respiration. Using
synthetic datasets, we systematically evaluated six experimental cases,
progressing from clean, noise free benchmarks to stress tests with high (35%)
multiplicative, spatially correlated noise. Our results highlight both the
potential and limitations of the approach. In noise free and moderate noise
settings, the UDE accurately reconstructed SOC dynamics. In clean terminal
profile at 50 years (Case 4) achieved near perfect fidelity, with MSE = 1.6e-5,
and R2 = 0.9999. Case 5, with 7% noise, remained robust (MSE = 3.4e-6, R2 =
0.99998), capturing depth wise SOC trends while tolerating realistic
measurement uncertainty. In contrast, Case 3 (35% noise at t = 0) showed clear
evidence of overfitting: the model reproduced noisy inputs with high accuracy
but lost generalization against the clean truth (R2 = 0.94). Case 6 (35% noise
at t = 50) collapsed toward overly smooth mean profiles, failing to capture
depth wise variability and yielding negative R2, underscoring the limits of
standard training under severe uncertainty. These findings suggest that UDEs
are well suited for scalable, noise tolerant SOC forecasting, though advancing
toward field deployment will require noise aware loss functions, probabilistic
modelling, and tighter integration of microbial dynamics.

*Xianhang Li,Chen Huang,Chun-Liang Li,Eran Malach,Josh Susskind,Vimal Thilak,Etai Littwin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SALT, a two-stage approach to video representation learning that replaces EMA-based training with a simpler, scalable static teacher-student model using latent prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPA) rely on an EMA-updated teacher to prevent representation collapse, but this method complicates scalability and model independence between teacher and student architectures.

Method: The proposed SALT method involves two stages: first, training a teacher encoder with a pixel-reconstruction task, and then freezing it to train a student on predicting teacher latents in masked regions, thus eliminating the need for EMA updates.

Result: SALT-trained student models surpass the performance of V-JEPA counterparts in diverse benchmarks, demonstrating superior compute-efficiency, better accuracy-FLOPs trade-offs, and robustness to teacher quality.

Conclusion: SALT provides a scalable, efficient, and simpler method for video representation learning, decoupling teacher-student optimization and offering a compelling alternative to EMA-based approaches.

Abstract: Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPA) learn generalizable
off-the-shelf video representation by predicting masked regions in latent space
with an exponential moving average (EMA)-updated teacher. While EMA prevents
representation collapse, it complicates scalable model selection and couples
teacher and student architectures. We revisit masked-latent prediction and show
that a frozen teacher suffices. Concretely, we (i) train a target encoder with
a simple pixel-reconstruction objective under V-JEPA masking, then (ii) freeze
it and train a student to predict the teacher's latents on masked regions. This
leads to a two-stage, unregularized scheme that we refer to as SALT
(Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training). SALT decouples optimization into
pixel reconstruction (teacher) and masked latent prediction (student),
increasing transparency, efficiency, and scalability while preserving the
ability of representation to generalize under frozen evaluation. Empirically,
our student models outperform recently proposed V-JEPA 2 encoders under frozen
backbone evaluation across diverse benchmarks. They are also more
compute-optimal: at matched pretraining FLOPs, our method achieves higher
probing accuracy, and its scaling curves dominate V-JEPA's accuracy-FLOPs
Pareto frontier. Finally, we find that student quality is remarkably robust to
teacher quality: high-performing students emerge even with small, sub-optimal
teachers. This points to a compute budget allocation that should overwhelmingly
favor the student. These results position SALT as a simple, scalable, and
compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video
representation learning.

*Shiyuan Zuo,Rongfei Fan,Cheng Zhan,Jie Xu,Puning Zhao,Han Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces H+, a similarity-aware aggregation method for Federated Learning (FL) that effectively counters Byzantine attacks, even in scenarios where clean data is unavailable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation in existing similarity-aware aggregation methods that rely on clean data, making them inapplicable in scenarios without clean data.

Method: H+ randomly selects segments of parameter vectors and applies a similarity check against a reference vector derived either from robust algorithms or clean data. This preserves similar client vectors for aggregation and repeats the process to identify honest clients.

Result: H+ demonstrates state-of-the-art robustness against varying Byzantine attack conditions and outperforms existing methods across different attack scenarios and benchmark datasets, with low computational complexity.

Conclusion: H+ enhances the capability of Federated Learning systems to resist Byzantine attacks both with and without clean data, providing robust and efficient aggregation methods.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing
raw data. However, it remains vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, which can
compromise the aggregation of locally updated parameters at the central server.
Similarity-aware aggregation has emerged as an effective strategy to mitigate
such attacks by identifying and filtering out malicious clients based on
similarity between client model parameters and those derived from clean data,
i.e., data that is uncorrupted and trustworthy. However, existing methods adopt
this strategy only in FL systems with clean data, making them inapplicable to
settings where such data is unavailable. In this paper, we propose H+, a novel
similarity-aware aggregation approach that not only outperforms existing
methods in scenarios with clean data, but also extends applicability to FL
systems without any clean data. Specifically, H+ randomly selects
$r$-dimensional segments from the $p$-dimensional parameter vectors uploaded to
the server and applies a similarity check function $H$ to compare each segment
against a reference vector, preserving the most similar client vectors for
aggregation. The reference vector is derived either from existing robust
algorithms when clean data is unavailable or directly from clean data.
Repeating this process $K$ times enables effective identification of honest
clients. Moreover, H+ maintains low computational complexity, with an
analytical time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(KMr)$, where $M$ is the number of
clients and $Kr \ll p$. Comprehensive experiments validate H+ as a
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, demonstrating substantial robustness
improvements over existing approaches under varying Byzantine attack ratios and
multiple types of traditional Byzantine attacks, across all evaluated scenarios
and benchmark datasets.

### [943] [Towards Generalizable PDE Dynamics Forecasting via Physics-Guided Invariant Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24332)
*Siyang Li,Yize Chen,Yan Guo,Ming Huang,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a new deep learning approach called iMOOE for forecasting spatiotemporal dynamics governed by PDEs, emphasizing zero-shot OOD generalization through a physics-guided methodology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models for forecasting spatiotemporal dynamics struggle with generalizing to unseen out-of-distribution scenarios due to a lack of integration of fundamental PDE invariance principles.

Method: The study introduces iMOOE, a physics-guided framework that captures a newly defined two-fold PDE invariance principle using a Mixture of Operator Expert architecture and a frequency-enriched invariant learning objective.

Result: Experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks demonstrated iMOOE's superior in-distribution accuracy and zero-shot generalization abilities under diverse OOD scenarios.

Conclusion: iMOOE effectively leverages PDE invariance principles to enhance generalization in spatiotemporal forecasting, making it a robust tool for science and engineering applications dealing with complex dynamics.

Abstract: Advanced deep learning-based approaches have been actively applied to
forecast the spatiotemporal physical dynamics governed by partial differential
equations (PDEs), which acts as a critical procedure in tackling many science
and engineering problems. As real-world physical environments like PDE system
parameters are always capricious, how to generalize across unseen
out-of-distribution (OOD) forecasting scenarios using limited training data is
of great importance. To bridge this barrier, existing methods focus on
discovering domain-generalizable representations across various PDE dynamics
trajectories. However, their zero-shot OOD generalization capability remains
deficient, since extra test-time samples for domain-specific adaptation are
still required. This is because the fundamental physical invariance in PDE
dynamical systems are yet to be investigated or integrated. To this end, we
first explicitly define a two-fold PDE invariance principle, which points out
that ingredient operators and their composition relationships remain invariant
across different domains and PDE system evolution. Next, to capture this
two-fold PDE invariance, we propose a physics-guided invariant learning method
termed iMOOE, featuring an Invariance-aligned Mixture Of Operator Expert
architecture and a frequency-enriched invariant learning objective. Extensive
experiments across simulated benchmarks and real-world applications validate
iMOOE's superior in-distribution performance and zero-shot generalization
capabilities on diverse OOD forecasting scenarios.

### [944] [Expanding Horizons of Level Diversity via Multi-objective Evolutionary Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24341)
*Qingquan Zhang,Ziqi Wang,Yuchen Li,Keyuan Zhang,Bo Yuan,Jialin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for training generative models to enhance multi-dimensional diversity in game level creation, using multi-objective evolutionary learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing level generation methods struggle to comprehensively account for diverse level metrics across multiple dimensions, which are often conflicting or complementary.

Method: The authors propose a multi-objective learning model, where each diversity metric serves as an independent objective, combined with a multi-objective evolutionary learning framework.

Result: Applying this framework to Super Mario Bros., they enhanced multi-dimensional diversity and produced a Pareto front of generative models showing trade-offs between playability and two diversity metrics.

Conclusion: This framework supports informed decisions for selecting level generators that meet various needs of players and designers by balancing playability and diversity.

Abstract: In recent years, the generation of diverse game levels has gained increasing
interest, contributing to a richer and more engaging gaming experience. A
number of level diversity metrics have been proposed in literature, which are
naturally multi-dimensional, leading to conflicted, complementary, or both
relationships among these dimensions. However, existing level generation
approaches often fail to comprehensively assess diversity across those
dimensions. This paper aims to expand horizons of level diversity by
considering multi-dimensional diversity when training generative models. We
formulate the model training as a multi-objective learning problem, where each
diversity metric is treated as a distinct objective. Furthermore, a
multi-objective evolutionary learning framework that optimises multiple
diversity metrics simultaneously throughout the model training process is
proposed. Our case study on the commonly used benchmark Super Mario Bros.
demonstrates that our proposed framework can enhance multi-dimensional
diversity and identify a Pareto front of generative models, which provides a
range of tradeoffs among playability and two representative diversity metrics,
including a content-based one and a player-centered one. Such capability
enables decision-makers to make informed choices when selecting generators
accommodating a variety of scenarios and the diverse needs of players and
designers.

### [945] [Watermarking Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24368)
*Thibaud Gloaguen,Robin Staab,Nikola Jovanović,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first effective watermark technique for diffusion language models (DLMs), achieving >99% true positive rates with minimal quality impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current watermarking techniques for autoregressive language models (ARLMs) do not work efficiently for DLMs due to their non-sequential token generation approach.

Method: The method applies the watermark in expectation over the context, even with incomplete token sequences, and promotes tokens that strengthen the watermark as future context while maintaining an unchanged watermark detector.

Result: The proposed watermark achieves a high true positive detection rate (>99%) without significantly affecting model quality, and shows comparable robustness to ARLM watermarking methods.

Conclusion: This work pioneers reliable watermarking methods for DLMs, proving they can be effectively secured without compromising functionality or robustness.

Abstract: We introduce the first watermark tailored for diffusion language models
(DLMs), an emergent LLM paradigm able to generate tokens in arbitrary order, in
contrast to standard autoregressive language models (ARLMs) which generate
tokens sequentially. While there has been much work in ARLM watermarking, a key
challenge when attempting to apply these schemes directly to the DLM setting is
that they rely on previously generated tokens, which are not always available
with DLM generation. In this work we address this challenge by: (i) applying
the watermark in expectation over the context even when some context tokens are
yet to be determined, and (ii) promoting tokens which increase the watermark
strength when used as context for other tokens. This is accomplished while
keeping the watermark detector unchanged. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that the DLM watermark leads to a >99% true positive rate with
minimal quality impact and achieves similar robustness to existing ARLM
watermarks, enabling for the first time reliable DLM watermarking.

### [946] [AXIS: Explainable Time Series Anomaly Detection with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24378)
*Tian Lan,Hao Duong Le,Jinbo Li,Wenjun He,Meng Wang,Chenghao Liu,Chen Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AXIS, a framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with tailored hints to improve explainability and detection accuracy in time-series anomaly detection (TSAD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLMs face challenges in explaining anomalies in time series due to their inability to process continuous signals directly, necessitating representation alignment and contextual grounding between time-series data and text.

Method: AXIS incorporates a frozen LLM with three key hints: a symbolic numeric hint, a step-aligned hint from a pretrained time-series encoder, and a task-prior hint. Additionally, a new benchmark for evaluation focusing on explainability is introduced.

Result: AXIS demonstrates both superior quality in explanations and competitive anomaly detection accuracy in comparison to state-of-the-art general-purpose, time-series-specific LLMs, and Vision Language Models.

Conclusion: AXIS effectively bridges the gap between time-series data and LLMs, advancing explainable TSAD with improved anomaly recognition and explanatory capabilities.

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) increasingly demands explanations that
articulate not only if an anomaly occurred, but also what pattern it exhibits
and why it is anomalous. Leveraging the impressive explanatory capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs), recent works have attempted to treat time series
as text for explainable TSAD. However, this approach faces a fundamental
challenge: LLMs operate on discrete tokens and struggle to directly process
long, continuous signals. Consequently, naive time-to-text serialization
suffers from a lack of contextual grounding and representation alignment
between the two modalities. To address this gap, we introduce AXIS, a framework
that conditions a frozen LLM for nuanced time-series understanding. Instead of
direct serialization, AXIS enriches the LLM's input with three complementary
hints derived from the series: (i) a symbolic numeric hint for numerical
grounding, (ii) a context-integrated, step-aligned hint distilled from a
pretrained time-series encoder to capture fine-grained dynamics, and (iii) a
task-prior hint that encodes global anomaly characteristics. Furthermore, to
facilitate robust evaluation of explainability, we introduce a new benchmark
featuring multi-format questions and rationales that supervise contextual
grounding and pattern-level semantics. Extensive experiments, including both
LLM-based and human evaluations, demonstrate that AXIS yields explanations of
significantly higher quality and achieves competitive detection accuracy
compared to general-purpose LLMs, specialized time-series LLMs, and time-series
Vision Language Models.

*Sushant Mehta,Raj Dandekar,Rajat Dandekar,Sreedath Panat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the Muon optimizer for small to medium decoder transformers, providing mathematical analysis and empirical benchmarks showcasing efficiency advantages over AdamW.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve optimization techniques for training transformers by addressing compute-time and data efficiency trade-offs, leveraging a theoretical and practical evaluation of Muon in modern AI settings.

Method: Theoretical analysis of convergence, spectral regularization, natural gradient connections, and equivalence to steepest descent; empirical validation of Muon’s performance in large-scale model training with enhancements like MLA and MoE.

Result: Muon achieves 48-52% reduction in training computation compared to AdamW, improves perplexity, and shows significant memory and speed efficiency gains when combined with MLA+MoE.

Conclusion: Muon is a robust and efficient optimizer with theoretical rigor and practical advantages, especially beneficial in large-batch, modern training regimes with efficiency techniques.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical and empirical study of the Muon
optimizer for training transformers only with a small to medium decoder (30M -
200M parameters), with an emphasis on its mathematical foundations, convergence
properties and synergistic interactions with modern architectural
optimizations. Building on recent work showing Muon's scalability, we provide
rigorous theoretical analysis including: (i)showing the convergence rate under
standard assumptions, (ii) spectral regularization properties that prevent
gradient explosion, (iii) connection to natural gradient descent on the Stiefel
manifold, and (iv) equivalence to steepest gradient descent under the spectral
norm. Crucially, we demonstrate that Muon expands the Pareto frontier in the
compute-time trade-off by maintaining superior data efficiency at large batch
sizes, a key finding of~\cite{essentialai2025muon} that we validate across our
model scales. Empirically, Muon reaches the target loss with 48-52\% of the
training calculated by AdamW while maintaining or improving the final
perplexity, consistent with larger-scale results. When combined with Multi-Head
Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), we observe multiplicative
efficiency gains: MLA+MoE+Muon achieves 68\% memory reduction and 3.2$\times$
inference speedup, while improving perplexity by 8-12\%. We provide detailed
procedures on 15 architectural and optimizer components, stability analyzes
across 100+ training runs, and practical implementation guidelines including
Newton-Schulz coefficients $(3.4445, -4.7750, 2.0315)$ optimized
by~\cite{su2024muonblog}. Our theoretical analysis and comprehensive
experiments establish Muon as a principled, robust alternative to AdamW that
particularly excels when combined with modern efficiency techniques and
large-batch training regimes.

*Tao Yin,Xiaohong Zhang,Shaochen Fu,Zhibin Zhang,Li Huang,Yiyuan Yang,Kaixiang Yang,Meng Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the inefficiencies in traditional time series anomaly detection methods for industrial IoT, introducing ScatterAD, a method leveraging representation scattering to enhance detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of traditional anomaly detection models that separately handle spatial and temporal dependencies, which leads to suboptimal representation learning and poor sensitivity to anomalies in high-dimensional data.

Method: ScatterAD employs a topological encoder for graph-structured scattering, a temporal encoder to manage over-scattering, and a contrastive fusion mechanism for complementary representation learning. This approach is theoretically grounded on maximizing conditional mutual information between views.

Result: ScatterAD demonstrates superior anomaly detection capabilities by outperforming other methods across various public benchmarks, thanks to its effective handling of spatio-temporal representation scattering.

Conclusion: This research promotes ScatterAD as an advanced and effective solution for multivariate time series anomaly detection, offering improved representational consistency and sensitivity to anomalies, with theoretical and empirical validation supporting its robustness.

Abstract: One main challenge in time series anomaly detection for industrial IoT lies
in the complex spatio-temporal couplings within multivariate data. However,
traditional anomaly detection methods focus on modeling spatial or temporal
dependencies independently, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and
limited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces. In this
work, we conduct an empirical analysis showing that both normal and anomalous
samples tend to scatter in high-dimensional space, especially anomalous samples
are markedly more dispersed. We formalize this dispersion phenomenon as
scattering, quantified by the mean pairwise distance among sample
representations, and leverage it as an inductive signal to enhance
spatio-temporal anomaly detection. Technically, we propose ScatterAD to model
representation scattering across temporal and topological dimensions. ScatterAD
incorporates a topological encoder for capturing graph-structured scattering
and a temporal encoder for constraining over-scattering through mean squared
error minimization between neighboring time steps. We introduce a contrastive
fusion mechanism to ensure the complementarity of the learned temporal and
topological representations. Additionally, we theoretically show that
maximizing the conditional mutual information between temporal and topological
views improves cross-view consistency and enhances more discriminative
representations. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that
ScatterAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series
anomaly detection. Code is available at this repository:

### [949] [Semantic Compression via Multimodal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24431)
*Eleonora Grassucci,Giordano Cicchetti,Aurelio Uncini,Danilo Comminiello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenge of semantic compression in multimodal representation learning, proposing a method to reduce memory usage while preserving semantic integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the scalability issues in multimodal representation learning, particularly the need for more efficient embedding storage while maintaining semantic content across modalities.

Method: The authors developed a semantic compression approach that utilizes centroids to represent shared semantic concepts in embeddings of different modalities, leveraging pretrained encoders and modality alignment.

Result: The approach successfully compresses embeddings, saving memory while retaining performance across diverse multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: Aligning modalities is a critical factor for achieving semantic compression, making the proposed method effective in both reducing storage demands and maintaining task performance.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning produces high-dimensional embeddings that
align diverse modalities in a shared latent space. While this enables strong
generalization, it also introduces scalability challenges, both in terms of
storage and downstream processing. A key open problem is how to achieve
semantic compression, reducing the memory footprint of multimodal embeddings
while preserving their ability to represent shared semantic content across
modalities. In this paper, we prove a strong connection between reducing the
modality gap, which is the residual separation of embeddings from different
modalities, and the feasibility of post-training semantic compression. When the
gap is sufficiently reduced, embeddings from different modalities but
expressing the same semantics share a common portion of the space. Therefore,
their centroid is a faithful representation of such a semantic concept. This
enables replacing multiple embeddings with a single centroid, yielding
significant memory savings. We propose a novel approach for semantic
compression grounded on the latter intuition, operating directly on pretrained
encoders. We demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse large-scale
multimodal downstream tasks. Our results highlight that modality alignment is a
key enabler for semantic compression, showing that the proposed approach
achieves significant compression without sacrificing performance.

*Zifan Wang,Xinlei Yi,Xenia Konti,Michael M. Zavlanos,Karl H. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework to enhance federated learning by addressing data distribution issues and outlier impacts using a novel optimization approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve federated learning performance degraded by data distribution shifts and outliers.

Method: A new ambiguity set based on unbalanced Wasserstein distance and Kullback-Leibler penalization is proposed alongside a decentralized training reformulation.

Result: Extensive experiments confirm enhanced performance on synthetic and real-world datasets using the proposed method.

Conclusion: The study introduces a robust federated learning algorithm and establishes its effectiveness, tackling geometric shifts and outlier issues with convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without direct
data sharing, but its performance can degrade significantly in the presence of
data distribution perturbations. Distributionally robust optimization (DRO)
provides a principled framework for handling this by optimizing performance
against the worst-case distributions within a prescribed ambiguity set.
However, existing DRO-based FL methods often overlook the detrimental impact of
outliers in local datasets, which can disproportionately bias the learned
models. In this work, we study distributionally robust federated learning with
explicit outlier resilience. We introduce a novel ambiguity set based on the
unbalanced Wasserstein distance, which jointly captures geometric
distributional shifts and incorporates a non-geometric Kullback--Leibler
penalization to mitigate the influence of outliers. This formulation naturally
leads to a challenging min--max--max optimization problem. To enable
decentralized training, we reformulate the problem as a tractable Lagrangian
penalty optimization, which admits robustness certificates. Building on this
reformulation, we propose the distributionally outlier-robust federated
learning algorithm and establish its convergence guarantees. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

### [951] [FS-KAN: Permutation Equivariant Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks via Function Sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24472)
*Ran Elbaz,Guy Bar-Shalom,Yam Eitan,Fabrizio Frasca,Haggai Maron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Function Sharing Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (FS-KAN), a novel neural architecture for handling permutation symmetries in a unified and principled way.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods employing parameter-sharing leverage data symmetries, yet lack a generalized framework for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in permutations, limiting their wider application.

Method: The authors developed FS-KAN by generalizing parameter-sharing to Kolmogorov-Arnold layers, maintaining expressive power comparable to standard networks and introducing key theoretical advances.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate superior data efficiency of FS-KAN over standard parameter-sharing methods, especially in low-data scenarios, while retaining KAN-specific benefits like interpretability.

Conclusion: FS-KAN offers a robust architecture that unifies permutation equivariance, enhances data efficiency, and retains model interpretability, particularly excelling in low-data environments.

Abstract: Permutation equivariant neural networks employing parameter-sharing schemes
have emerged as powerful models for leveraging a wide range of data symmetries,
significantly enhancing the generalization and computational efficiency of the
resulting models. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have demonstrated
promise through their improved interpretability and expressivity compared to
traditional architectures based on MLPs. While equivariant KANs have been
explored in recent literature for a few specific data types, a principled
framework for applying them to data with permutation symmetries in a general
context remains absent. This paper introduces Function Sharing KAN (FS-KAN), a
principled approach to constructing equivariant and invariant KA layers for
arbitrary permutation symmetry groups, unifying and significantly extending
previous work in this domain. We derive the basic construction of these FS-KAN
layers by generalizing parameter-sharing schemes to the Kolmogorov-Arnold setup
and provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that FS-KANs have the same
expressive power as networks that use standard parameter-sharing layers,
allowing us to transfer well-known and important expressivity results from
parameter-sharing networks to FS-KANs. Empirical evaluations on multiple data
types and symmetry groups show that FS-KANs exhibit superior data efficiency
compared to standard parameter-sharing layers, by a wide margin in certain
cases, while preserving the interpretability and adaptability of KANs, making
them an excellent architecture choice in low-data regimes.

*Minh Le,Bao-Ngoc Dao,Huy Nguyen,Quyen Tran,Anh Nguyen,Nhat Ho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SMoPE, a framework aiming to optimize Continual Learning (CL) using a hybrid strategy of task-specific and shared prompts, outperforming competing methods while using fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational and memory inefficiencies of task-specific prompts and the performance degradation issues of shared prompts in prompt-based Continual Learning frameworks.

Method: SMoPE organizes a shared prompt into multiple 'prompt experts' within a sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, dynamically activating only relevant experts for each input. The approach uses a prompt-attention score aggregation mechanism for expert selection, an adaptive noise mechanism for balanced utilization, and a prototype-based loss function for better expert specialization.

Result: SMoPE consistently surpasses task-specific prompt approaches and matches state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational and memory requirements.

Conclusion: SMoPE effectively combines the strengths of task-specific and shared prompt paradigms, offering a practical, efficient, and high-performing solution for Continual Learning.

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have recently gained prominence in Continual Learning
(CL) due to their strong performance and memory efficiency. A prevalent
strategy in this paradigm assigns a dedicated subset of prompts to each task,
which, while effective, incurs substantial computational overhead and causes
memory requirements to scale linearly with the number of tasks. Conversely,
approaches employing a single shared prompt across tasks offer greater
efficiency but often suffer from degraded performance due to knowledge
interference. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose SMoPE, a novel framework
that integrates the benefits of both task-specific and shared prompt
strategies. Inspired by recent findings on the relationship between Prefix
Tuning and Mixture of Experts (MoE), SMoPE organizes a shared prompt into
multiple "prompt experts" within a sparse MoE architecture. For each input,
only a select subset of relevant experts is activated, effectively mitigating
interference. To facilitate expert selection, we introduce a prompt-attention
score aggregation mechanism that computes a unified proxy score for each
expert, enabling dynamic and sparse activation. Additionally, we propose an
adaptive noise mechanism to encourage balanced expert utilization while
preserving knowledge from prior tasks. To further enhance expert
specialization, we design a prototype-based loss function that leverages prefix
keys as implicit memory representations. Extensive experiments across multiple
CL benchmarks demonstrate that SMoPE consistently outperforms task-specific
prompt methods and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art
approaches, all while significantly reducing parameter counts and computational
costs.

*Charmaine Barker,Daniel Bethell,Simos Gerasimou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GUIDE, a lightweight meta-model to improve uncertainty quantification in deep learning models, enhancing their reliability under distributional shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of reliable uncertainty quantification in deep learning, especially under distributional shifts, where models might exhibit misplaced confidence.

Method: GUIDE identifies key internal features through a calibration stage and employs a noise-driven curriculum to teach the model when and how to express uncertainty, without retraining or altering the original model's architecture.

Result: GUIDE improves out-of-distribution detection by approximately 77% and adversarial attack detection by ~80%, while maintaining performance on in-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: GUIDE offers a robust method to guide uncertainty, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches, and demonstrates the importance of actively addressing predictive confidence and reliability.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification remains a major obstacle to the
deployment of deep learning models under distributional shift. Existing
post-hoc approaches that retrofit pretrained models either inherit misplaced
confidence or merely reshape predictions, without teaching the model when to be
uncertain. We introduce GUIDE, a lightweight evidential learning meta-model
approach that attaches to a frozen deep learning model and explicitly learns
how and when to be uncertain. GUIDE identifies salient internal features via a
calibration stage, and then employs these features to construct a noise-driven
curriculum that teaches the model how and when to express uncertainty. GUIDE
requires no retraining, no architectural modifications, and no manual
intermediate-layer selection to the base deep learning model, thus ensuring
broad applicability and minimal user intervention. The resulting model avoids
distilling overconfidence from the base model, improves out-of-distribution
detection by ~77% and adversarial attack detection by ~80%, while preserving
in-distribution performance. Across diverse benchmarks, GUIDE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, evidencing the need for actively
guiding uncertainty to close the gap between predictive confidence and
reliability.

### [954] [LLM DNA: Tracing Model Evolution via Functional Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24496)
*Zhaomin Wu,Haodong Zhao,Ziyang Wang,Jizhou Guo,Qian Wang,Bingsheng He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'LLM DNA' as a method for mapping and analyzing the evolutionary relationships of large language models (LLMs) based on their functional behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the opacity in the LLM landscape caused by millions of models and undocumented evolutionary relationships, which complicate their management.

Method: The authors define 'LLM DNA' as a low-dimensional, bi-Lipschitz representation of functional behavior and propose a general, scalable, training-free pipeline to extract this DNA.

Result: The method is validated across 305 LLMs, aligning with prior studies and achieving competitive performance on specific tasks. It also uncovers undocumented relationships and generates evolutionary trees using phylogenetic algorithms.

Conclusion: LLM DNA provides a novel framework for analyzing and managing LLMs, reflecting architectural trends, temporal shifts, and evolutionary dynamics in the LLM ecosystem.

Abstract: The explosive growth of large language models (LLMs) has created a vast but
opaque landscape: millions of models exist, yet their evolutionary
relationships through fine-tuning, distillation, or adaptation are often
undocumented or unclear, complicating LLM management. Existing methods are
limited by task specificity, fixed model sets, or strict assumptions about
tokenizers or architectures. Inspired by biological DNA, we address these
limitations by mathematically defining LLM DNA as a low-dimensional,
bi-Lipschitz representation of functional behavior. We prove that LLM DNA
satisfies inheritance and genetic determinism properties and establish the
existence of DNA. Building on this theory, we derive a general, scalable,
training-free pipeline for DNA extraction. In experiments across 305 LLMs, DNA
aligns with prior studies on limited subsets and achieves superior or
competitive performance on specific tasks. Beyond these tasks, DNA comparisons
uncover previously undocumented relationships among LLMs. We further construct
the evolutionary tree of LLMs using phylogenetic algorithms, which align with
shifts from encoder-decoder to decoder-only architectures, reflect temporal
progression, and reveal distinct evolutionary speeds across LLM families.

*Jonas Hübotter,Patrik Wolf,Alexander Shevchenko,Dennis Jüni,Andreas Krause,Gil Kur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates Test-Time Training (TTT), its effectiveness, and its connection to specialization in foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why and when Test-Time Training (TTT) improves performance, particularly when working with in-distribution data in foundation models.

Method: Propose a specialization model for foundation models under a linear representation hypothesis, provide empirical validation using a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, and perform scaling studies for image and language tasks.

Result: The study confirms that TTT allows for specialization after generalization in foundation models, reducing in-distribution test error, supported by empirical evidence and scaling studies.

Conclusion: TTT is effective in enhancing model performance under specific conditions, particularly by enabling specialization in foundation models for a given task.

Abstract: Recent empirical studies have explored the idea of continuing to train a
model at test-time for a given task, known as test-time training (TTT), and
have found it to yield significant performance improvements. However, there is
limited understanding of why and when TTT is effective. Earlier explanations
mostly focused on the observation that TTT may help when applied to
out-of-distribution adaptation or used with privileged data. However, the
growing scale of foundation models with most test data being in-distribution
questions these explanations. We instead posit that foundation models remain
globally underparameterized, with TTT providing a mechanism for specialization
after generalization, focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task.
Specifically, under the linear representation hypothesis, we propose a model in
which TTT achieves a substantially smaller in-distribution test error than
global training. We empirically validate our model's key assumptions by
training a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, showing that semantically related
data points are explained by only a few shared concepts. Finally, we perform
scaling studies across image and language tasks that confirm the practical
implications of our model, identifying the regimes where specialization is most
effective.

*Sophia N. Wilson,Jens Hesselbjerg Christensen,Raghavendra Selvan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper discusses incorporating physics-based inductive biases into deep learning models to enhance their efficiency (compute, energy, and carbon footprint) while retaining or improving their accuracy, particularly for spatio-temporal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern deep learning prioritizes accuracy over efficiency, leading to resource-intensive models with large carbon footprints. The paper aims to investigate alternative methods to balance efficiency and efficacy.

Method: Physics inductive biases are embedded into the model design for spatio-temporal forecasting tasks, using both standard physics-informed models and newer approaches like flow matching.

Result: Incorporating physics inductive biases results in significant efficiency gains (e.g., lower energy and carbon usage) without compromising or even improving accuracy.

Conclusion: Physics inductive biases allow for principled improvement in machine learning model efficiency, and the authors advocate for efficiency becoming a core consideration alongside efficacy in model development.

Abstract: Development of modern deep learning methods has been driven primarily by the
push for improving model efficacy (accuracy metrics). This sole focus on
efficacy has steered development of large-scale models that require massive
resources, and results in considerable carbon footprint across the model
life-cycle. In this work, we explore how physics inductive biases can offer
useful trade-offs between model efficacy and model efficiency (compute, energy,
and carbon). We study a variety of models for spatio-temporal forecasting, a
task governed by physical laws and well-suited for exploring different levels
of physics inductive bias. We show that embedding physics inductive biases into
the model design can yield substantial efficiency gains while retaining or even
improving efficacy for the tasks under consideration. In addition to using
standard physics-informed spatio-temporal models, we demonstrate the usefulness
of more recent models like flow matching as a general purpose method for
spatio-temporal forecasting. Our experiments show that incorporating physics
inductive biases offer a principled way to improve the efficiency and reduce
the carbon footprint of machine learning models. We argue that model
efficiency, along with model efficacy, should become a core consideration
driving machine learning model development and deployment.

*Bao-Ngoc Dao,Quang Nguyen,Luyen Ngo Dinh,Minh Le,Linh Ngo Van*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Few-shot Continual Event Detection (FCED) tackles learning from limited data and preventing forgetting across sequential tasks. LEAF introduces expert specialization, semantic-aware routing, and contrastive learning for enhanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and limited data availability in FCED, while overcoming issues like knowledge interference and reliance on flawed data augmentation.

Method: LEAF uses a mixture of experts architecture with LoRA matrices, semantic-aware routing for expert selection, contrastive learning objectives, and knowledge distillation for better task management.

Result: LEAF outperforms existing benchmarks in FCED tasks, delivering robust performance while mitigating knowledge interference and enhancing generalization.

Conclusion: LEAF introduces innovative methods to tackle FCED problems, establishing itself as a reliable solution for continual learning and event detection with limited data.

Abstract: Few-shot Continual Event Detection (FCED) poses the dual challenges of
learning from limited data and mitigating catastrophic forgetting across
sequential tasks. Existing approaches often suffer from severe forgetting due
to the full fine-tuning of a shared base model, which leads to knowledge
interference between tasks. Moreover, they frequently rely on data augmentation
strategies that can introduce unnatural or semantically distorted inputs. To
address these limitations, we propose LEAF, a novel and robust expert-based
framework for FCED. LEAF integrates a specialized mixture of experts
architecture into the base model, where each expert is parameterized with
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices. A semantic-aware expert selection
mechanism dynamically routes instances to the most relevant experts, enabling
expert specialization and reducing knowledge interference. To improve
generalization in limited-data settings, LEAF incorporates a contrastive
learning objective guided by label descriptions, which capture high-level
semantic information about event types. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting on
the memory buffer, our framework employs a knowledge distillation strategy that
transfers knowledge from previous models to the current one. Extensive
experiments on multiple FCED benchmarks demonstrate that LEAF consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Eleonora Grassucci,Giuliano Galadini,Giordano Cicchetti,Aurelio Uncini,Fabio Antonacci,Danilo Comminiello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a lightweight, training-free multimodal guidance mechanism for generating audio from silent videos using audio diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in video-to-audio generation methods that either require costly large-scale training or have limited multimodal coherence.

Method: Proposed a Multimodal Diffusion Guidance (MDG) mechanism that enforces unified alignment across video, audio, and text without the need for retraining.

Result: Experiments on VGGSound and AudioCaps show that MDG enhances perceptual quality and multimodal alignment compared to other approaches.

Conclusion: The MDG mechanism effectively improves video-to-audio generation and can be applied to any pretrained audio diffusion model, offering a lightweight and efficient solution.

Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned audio from silent videos, with potential applications in video editing,
Foley sound design, and assistive multimedia. Although the excellent results,
existing approaches either require costly joint training on large-scale paired
datasets or rely on pairwise similarities that may fail to capture global
multimodal coherence. In this work, we propose a novel training-free multimodal
guidance mechanism for V2A diffusion that leverages the volume spanned by the
modality embeddings to enforce unified alignment across video, audio, and text.
The proposed multimodal diffusion guidance (MDG) provides a lightweight,
plug-and-play control signal that can be applied on top of any pretrained audio
diffusion model without retraining. Experiments on VGGSound and AudioCaps
demonstrate that our MDG consistently improves perceptual quality and
multimodal alignment compared to baselines, proving the effectiveness of a
joint multimodal guidance for V2A.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SWAX, a hybrid model combining sliding-window attention and xLSTM layers. The study finds that smaller sliding windows improve long-term memory usage, but a mix of window sizes enhances overall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the interplay between sliding-window softmax attention and linear RNN layers, and to investigate if combining these mechanisms enhances performance for both short and long-context tasks.

Method: SWAX architecture combines sliding-window attention with xLSTM layers. It trains the model using stochastic window sizes to optimize its ability to handle both short and long-term memory tasks.

Result: SWAX outperforms regular sliding-window attention on both short and long-context problems, especially when trained with stochastic window sizes.

Conclusion: A hybrid model like SWAX, which leverages adaptive sliding windows, can solve challenges in long-term context retrieval while maintaining efficiency for short-context tasks.

Abstract: Recent works show that hybrid architectures combining sliding window softmax
attention layers with linear recurrent neural network (RNN) layers outperform
both of these architectures taken separately. However, the impact of the window
length and the interplay between softmax attention and linear RNN layers remain
under-studied. In this work, we introduce SWAX, a hybrid architecture
consisting of sliding-window attention and xLSTM linear RNN layers.
  A counter-intuitive finding with SWAX is that larger sliding windows do not
improve the long-context performance. In fact, short window attention
encourages the model to better train the long-term memory of the xLSTM, by
relying less on the softmax attention mechanism for long context-retrieval.
  The issue with small sliding windows is that they are detrimental for
short-context tasks, which could be solved with information from moderately
larger sliding windows otherwise. Therefore, we train SWAX by stochastically
changing the sliding window size, forcing the model to leverage both a longer
context window and the xLSTM memory. SWAX trained with stochastic window sizes
significantly outperforms regular window attention both on short and
long-context problems.

*Hussam Sababha,Bernat Font,Mohammed Daqaq*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study uses deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for real-time active flow control of vortex-induced vibrations in a high Reynolds number setup, achieving effective vibration suppression under practical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the feasibility and adaptability of real-time DRL for active flow control in experimental, high Reynolds number settings, addressing practical challenges like actuator delays.

Method: The study employed DRL with state feedback (displacement and velocity) to develop a control strategy for rotary actuation, and also augmented the learning algorithm with past actions to mitigate actuation delays.

Result: The DRL agent achieved up to 80% vibration suppression using low-frequency rotary control, and over 95% vibration suppression by employing a high-frequency rotary control strategy that accounts for actuation delays.

Conclusion: Deep reinforcement learning shows promise for experimental active flow control, effectively overcoming limitations such as actuation lag to achieve high levels of vibration attenuation.

Abstract: This study showcases an experimental deployment of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) for active flow control (AFC) of vortex-induced vibrations (VIV)
in a circular cylinder at a high Reynolds number (Re = 3000) using rotary
actuation. Departing from prior work that relied on low-Reynolds-number
numerical simulations, this research demonstrates real-time control in a
challenging experimental setting, successfully addressing practical constraints
such as actuator delay. When the learning algorithm is provided with state
feedback alone (displacement and velocity of the oscillating cylinder), the DRL
agent learns a low-frequency rotary control strategy that achieves up to 80%
vibration suppression which leverages the traditional lock-on phenomenon. While
this level of suppression is significant, it remains below the performance
achieved using high-frequency rotary actuation. The reduction in performance is
attributed to actuation delays and can be mitigated by augmenting the learning
algorithm with past control actions. This enables the agent to learn a
high-frequency rotary control strategy that effectively modifies vortex
shedding and achieves over 95% vibration attenuation. These results demonstrate
the adaptability of DRL for AFC in real-world experiments and its ability to
overcome instrumental limitations such as actuation lag.

*Marco Molinari,Leonardo Nevali,Saharsha Navani,Omar G. Younis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether Vision Language Action (VLA) models, specifically OpenVLA, implicitly learn world models by examining state transitions using embedding arithmetic and probing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if VLAs, like OpenVLA, encode internal world models as they train, a key aspect of model-based reinforcement learning, despite VLAs being policy-based models.

Method: The authors employed embedding arithmetic, along with linear and nonlinear probes on model activations, to analyze whether state transition vectors could be predicted. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) were also integrated as part of their analysis pipeline.

Result: Results revealed that OpenVLA encodes an implicit world model since probes could predict state transitions better than baseline embeddings. Additionally, progression of training indicated the emergence of this world model over time.

Conclusion: OpenVLA implicitly learns a world model during training, and the authors propose methods like embedding arithmetic for evaluating such latent representations in future works.

Abstract: Vision Language Action models (VLAs) trained with policy-based reinforcement
learning (RL) encode complex behaviors without explicitly modeling
environmental dynamics. However, it remains unclear whether VLAs implicitly
learn world models, a hallmark of model-based RL. We propose an experimental
methodology using embedding arithmetic on state representations to probe
whether OpenVLA, the current state of the art in VLAs, contains latent
knowledge of state transitions. Specifically, we measure the difference between
embeddings of sequential environment states and test whether this transition
vector is recoverable from intermediate model activations. Using linear and non
linear probes trained on activations across layers, we find statistically
significant predictive ability on state transitions exceeding baselines
(embeddings), indicating that OpenVLA encodes an internal world model (as
opposed to the probes learning the state transitions). We investigate the
predictive ability of an earlier checkpoint of OpenVLA, and uncover hints that
the world model emerges as training progresses. Finally, we outline a pipeline
leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze OpenVLA's world model.

*Yusuf Guven,Vincenzo Di Vito,Ferdinando Fioretto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a learning-based framework using Neural Operators and optimization surrogate models for efficient PDE-constrained optimization, achieving high solution quality with significant computational speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDE-constrained optimization problems are computationally demanding due to the tight coupling of decision variables and PDE state variables, necessitating efficient methods to address challenges of high dimensionality and dynamic constraints.

Method: The authors developed a dual-network framework combining a time-discrete Neural Operator to model system trajectories and a proxy-based optimization surrogate to approximate optimal decisions while capturing PDE dynamics.

Result: The framework demonstrates solution quality comparable to classical methods like Direct Method and MPC, with computational speed improvements of up to four orders of magnitude on benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: This novel dual-network design offers a scalable and efficient approach to tackling PDE-constrained optimization problems in real-time, making it impactful for various scientific and engineering applications.

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization arises in many
scientific and engineering domains, such as energy systems, fluid dynamics and
material design. In these problems, the decision variables (e.g., control
inputs or design parameters) are tightly coupled with the PDE state variables,
and the feasible set is implicitly defined by the governing PDE constraints.
This coupling makes the problems computationally demanding, as it requires
handling high dimensional discretization and dynamic constraints. To address
these challenges, this paper introduces a learning-based framework that
integrates a dynamic predictor with an optimization surrogate. The dynamic
predictor, a novel time-discrete Neural Operator (Lu et al.), efficiently
approximate system trajectories governed by PDE dynamics, while the
optimization surrogate leverages proxy optimizer techniques (Kotary et al.) to
approximate the associated optimal decisions. This dual-network design enables
real-time approximation of optimal strategies while explicitly capturing the
coupling between decisions and PDE dynamics. We validate the proposed approach
on benchmark PDE-constrained optimization tasks inlacing Burgers' equation,
heat equation and voltage regulation, and demonstrate that it achieves solution
quality comparable to classical control-based algorithms, such as the Direct
Method and Model Predictive Control (MPC), while providing up to four orders of
magnitude improvement in computational speed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAIP, an adaptive module to improve image reconstruction in inverse problems using diffusion models by dynamically balancing prior and likelihood contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like DPS, DMPS, and πGDM use manually tuned static scales to balance prior and likelihood scores in inverse problems, which fail to adapt dynamically to specific tasks or timesteps, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: SAIP is a plug-and-play module that dynamically adjusts the balance between prior and likelihood scores at each timestep without the need for retraining or altering the diffusion model architecture.

Result: The proposed method consistently improves reconstruction performance across a variety of challenging image restoration tasks compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: SAIP demonstrates the ability to boost generalization and reconstruction quality in inverse problems with diffusion models, serving as an adaptive and effective alternative to traditional static scale methods.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with diffusion models has shown promise in tasks
such as image restoration. A common approach is to formulate the problem in a
Bayesian framework and sample from the posterior by combining the prior score
with the likelihood score. Since the likelihood term is often intractable,
estimators like DPS, DMPS, and $\pi$GDM are widely adopted. However, these
methods rely on a fixed, manually tuned scale to balance prior and likelihood
contributions. Such a static design is suboptimal, as the ideal balance varies
across timesteps and tasks, limiting performance and generalization. To address
this issue, we propose SAIP, a plug-and-play module that adaptively refines the
scale at each timestep without retraining or altering the diffusion backbone.
SAIP integrates seamlessly into existing samplers and consistently improves
reconstruction quality across diverse image restoration tasks, including
challenging scenarios.

TL;DR: CURA is a compact and generalizable AI architecture inspired by analog audio signal processing circuits, excelling in diverse tasks with fewer parameters and strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in existing on-device AI architectures, such as lack of compactness and restricted generalizability, which hinder performance in resource-constrained environments.

Method: CURA is developed as an architecture inspired by analog signal processing. It is designed to be lightweight, configurable for various ML tasks, and capable of recognizing complex data patterns while maintaining low parameter requirements.

Result: CURA achieved up to 2,500 times fewer parameters without losing accuracy, performed consistently across diverse NLP and computer vision benchmarks, and excelled in forecasting tasks with lower errors than competing methods.

Conclusion: CURA is a groundbreaking AI solution for resource-constrained environments, demonstrating high efficiency and adaptability across regression, classification, NLP, and computer vision tasks.

Abstract: Existing on-device AI architectures for resource-constrained environments
face two critical limitations: they lack compactness, with parameter
requirements scaling proportionally to task complexity, and they exhibit poor
generalizability, performing effectively only on specific application domains
(e.g., models designed for regression tasks cannot adapt to natural language
processing (NLP) applications). In this paper, we propose CURA, an architecture
inspired by analog audio signal processing circuits that provides a compact and
lightweight solution for diverse machine learning tasks across multiple
domains. Our architecture offers three key advantages over existing approaches:
(1) Compactness: it requires significantly fewer parameters regardless of task
complexity; (2) Generalizability: it adapts seamlessly across regression,
classification, complex NLP, and computer vision tasks; and (3) Complex pattern
recognition: it can capture intricate data patterns while maintaining extremely
low model complexity. We evaluated CURA across diverse datasets and domains.
For compactness, it achieved equivalent accuracy using up to 2,500 times fewer
parameters compared to baseline models. For generalizability, it demonstrated
consistent performance across four NLP benchmarks and one computer vision
dataset, nearly matching specialized existing models (achieving F1-scores up to
90%). Lastly, it delivers superior forecasting accuracy for complex patterns,
achieving 1.6 times lower mean absolute error and 2.1 times lower mean squared
error than competing models.

TL;DR: OrthAlign introduces a method using orthogonal subspace decomposition for aligning large language models (LLMs) to multiple human preferences, overcoming trade-offs between objectives like helpfulness and harmlessness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to resolve the issue of inherent trade-offs in aligning LLMs to multiple human preferences, where optimizing for one preference often degrades performance in others.

Method: The method, OrthAlign, uses orthogonal subspace decomposition to ensure independent optimization in different preference dimensions. Parameter updates are governed by orthogonal constraints and spectral norm bounds for stability.

Result: Experiments demonstrate OrthAlign's efficacy, achieving up to 50.89% improvement in specific preferences and 13.96% overall improvement in reward after multi-objective alignment.

Conclusion: OrthAlign provides a mathematically robust and experimentally validated solution for multi-objective preference alignment in LLMs, offering stable convergence and enhanced overall performance across dimensions.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment faces a critical dilemma when addressing
multiple human preferences: improvements in one dimension frequently come at
the expense of others, creating unavoidable trade-offs between competing
objectives like helpfulness and harmlessness. While prior work mainly focuses
on constraint-based optimization algorithms and data selection strategies to
mitigate conflicts, these approaches overlook the fundamental issue of
resolving conflicts directly at the parameter level. In this paper, we present
OrthAlign, an innovative approach that pioneers a new paradigm by leveraging
orthogonal subspace decomposition to fundamentally resolve gradient-level
conflicts in multi-objective preference alignment. OrthAlign strategically
decomposes parameter update spaces into orthogonal subspaces, ensuring that
optimization toward different preferences occurs in mathematically
non-interfering directions. Building upon this, we provide theoretical
guarantees demonstrating that when parameter increments satisfy both orthogonal
subspace constraints and spectral norm bounds, the resulting updates exhibit
linear Lipschitz growth rather than exponential instability, ensuring stable
convergence across all preference dimensions. Extensive experiments show that:
I. OrthAlign achieves maximum single-preference improvements ranging from
34.61% to 50.89% after multiple-objective alignment across helpful, harmless,
and truthful dimensions. II. With an average overall reward improvement of
13.96%.

Motivation: To address the challenge of scaling physics-inspired neural networks like Hamiltonian Neural Networks to high-dimensional systems while maintaining principles like energy conservation.

Method: Introduces a reduced-order modeling framework: a symplectic autoencoder to learn a low-dimensional structure-preserving submanifold, and a Hamiltonian neural network to model dynamics on this submanifold.

Result: RO-HNN delivers accurate, consistent, and adaptable predictions for high-dimensional physical systems' dynamics.

Conclusion: This work extends the applicability of Hamiltonian neural networks by providing a scalable and physically-consistent approach to modeling high-dimensional systems.

Abstract: By embedding physical intuition, network architectures enforce fundamental
properties, such as energy conservation laws, leading to plausible predictions.
Yet, scaling these models to intrinsically high-dimensional systems remains a
significant challenge. This paper introduces Geometric Reduced-order
Hamiltonian Neural Network (RO-HNN), a novel physics-inspired neural network
that combines the conservation laws of Hamiltonian mechanics with the
scalability of model order reduction. RO-HNN is built on two core components: a
novel geometrically-constrained symplectic autoencoder that learns a
low-dimensional, structure-preserving symplectic submanifold, and a geometric
Hamiltonian neural network that models the dynamics on the submanifold. Our
experiments demonstrate that RO-HNN provides physically-consistent, stable, and
generalizable predictions of complex high-dimensional dynamics, thereby
effectively extending the scope of Hamiltonian neural networks to
high-dimensional physical systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Identity Bridge mechanism, enhancing large language models' ability to handle compositional reasoning tasks like two-hop reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with compositional reasoning tasks, with two-hop reasoning being a key example of their limitations.

Method: The study designs the Identity Bridge, a zero-hop identity supervision mechanism, and demonstrates its efficacy in reshaping latent geometry and achieving better task alignment using techniques such as implicit nuclear-norm regularization.

Result: Models with the Identity Bridge succeed in out-of-distribution two-hop reasoning tasks and show improved latent memory and task structuring.

Conclusion: The Identity Bridge resolves the compositionality gap, enhances reasoning abilities in language models, and offers insights into improving latent alignments for complex tasks.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances, large language models often fail at
compositional reasoning tasks, a phenomenon exemplified by the ``curse of
two-hop reasoning''. This paper introduces the Identity Bridge, a simple yet
powerful mechanism that resolves this compositionality gap by supervising the
model on a zero-hop identity task. We demonstrate empirically that this
addition enables models to successfully perform out-of-distribution two-hop
reasoning, a task they otherwise completely fail. To explain this phenomenon,
we provide a theoretical analysis using a simplified Emb-MLP model, proving
that identity supervision reshapes the model's latent geometry. We show this
alignment is induced by an implicit nuclear-norm regularization during
optimization, which favors low-rank solutions that share structure across
tasks. For complex tasks, we use small initialization or weight decay to
enhance the regularization effect, which enhances the latent space alignment
effect and slows down the generalization decay. Finally, we extend our
investigation to large-scale models, observing that they still achieve two-hop
reasoning through the latent memory, which provides crucial inspiration for
enhancing their implicit reasoning abilities.

TL;DR: This paper presents HyperHELM, a framework for pre-training masked language models in hyperbolic space to better represent hierarchical structures in mRNA sequences. It outperforms Euclidean models on multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological sequences like mRNA inherently contain hierarchical structures, which are not optimally captured using default Euclidean geometry. Hyperbolic geometry could be better suited for this purpose.

Method: The study introduces a hybrid language model framework (HyperHELM) that integrates hyperbolic layers into a Euclidean model backbone for masked language model pre-training of mRNA sequences.

Result: HyperHELM demonstrates superior performance over Euclidean baselines across 9 out of 10 tasks, achieving 10% average improvement and showing better generalization to specific data types. It also surpasses hierarchy-aware Euclidean models in antibody region annotation accuracy by 3%.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic geometry is an effective inductive bias for hierarchical representation in mRNA sequence language modeling, improving prediction accuracy and generalizability.

Abstract: Language models are increasingly applied to biological sequences like
proteins and mRNA, yet their default Euclidean geometry may mismatch the
hierarchical structures inherent to biological data. While hyperbolic geometry
provides a better alternative for accommodating hierarchical data, it has yet
to find a way into language modeling for mRNA sequences. In this work, we
introduce HyperHELM, a framework that implements masked language model
pre-training in hyperbolic space for mRNA sequences. Using a hybrid design with
hyperbolic layers atop Euclidean backbone, HyperHELM aligns learned
representations with the biological hierarchy defined by the relationship
between mRNA and amino acids. Across multiple multi-species datasets, it
outperforms Euclidean baselines on 9 out of 10 tasks involving property
prediction, with 10% improvement on average, and excels in out-of-distribution
generalization to long and low-GC content sequences; for antibody region
annotation, it surpasses hierarchy-aware Euclidean models by 3% in annotation
accuracy. Our results highlight hyperbolic geometry as an effective inductive
bias for hierarchical language modeling of mRNA sequences.

TL;DR: The paper introduces T-POP, an algorithm enabling real-time and data-efficient personalization of large language models (LLMs) using pairwise preference feedback, without requiring fine-tuning or pre-existing user data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the 'cold-start' problem in personalizing LLMs for new users, where current methods require extensive user data or are computationally expensive.

Method: T-POP combines test-time alignment with dueling bandits, steering the decoding of a frozen LLM by learning user preferences online through pairwise feedback, without parameter updates.

Result: T-POP demonstrates significant improvements in personalization efficiency and performance compared to existing methods, especially as more user interactions occur.

Conclusion: The proposed T-POP algorithm offers a practical solution for quick and efficient user-specific adaptation of LLMs, addressing limitations of prior approaches.

Abstract: Personalizing large language models (LLMs) to individual user preferences is
a critical step beyond generating generically helpful responses. However,
current personalization methods are ill-suited for new users, as they typically
require either slow, resource-intensive fine-tuning or a substantial amount of
pre-existing user data, creating a significant cold-start problem. To address
this challenge, we introduce a new paradigm for real-time personalization by
learning from online pairwise preference feedback collected during text
generation. We propose T-POP (Test-Time Personalization with Online Preference
Feedback}), a novel algorithm that synergistically combines test-time alignment
with dueling bandits. Without updating the LLM parameters, T-POP steers the
decoding process of a frozen LLM by learning a reward function online that
captures user preferences. By leveraging dueling bandits, T-POP intelligently
queries the user to efficiently balance between exploring their preferences and
exploiting the learned knowledge to generate personalized text. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that T-POP achieves rapid and data-efficient
personalization, significantly outperforming existing baselines and showing
consistent improvement with more user interactions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces federated algorithms for optimizing prompts in large language models, addressing challenges like black-box optimization, sample efficiency, and collaborative privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt optimization is crucial for LLM performance but faces challenges like proprietary system constraints, query costs, and the need for privacy during multi-user collaborations.

Method: The authors propose two algorithms, FedPOB and FedPOB-Pref, utilizing federated multi-armed bandits to enable collaborative prompt optimization without data sharing.

Result: Experiments showed that FedPOB and FedPOB-Pref outperform existing methods and improve further with increased collaboration.

Conclusion: Federated multi-armed bandit-based approaches are effective and scalable for optimizing prompts in LLMs under privacy and sample-efficiency constraints.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the
input prompt, making prompt optimization a critical task. However, real-world
application is hindered by three major challenges: (1) the black-box nature of
powerful proprietary LLMs, (2) the need for high sample efficiency due to query
costs, and (3) the desire for privacy-preserving collaboration among multiple
users. To address these challenges simultaneously, we introduce a novel
framework for sample-efficient federated prompt optimization based on
multi-armed bandits (MABs). The MAB framework is uniquely suited for this
problem as it is (1) inherently a black-box optimization method, (2)
practically sample-efficient, and (3) enables collaborative learning with
theoretically guaranteed benefit from more participating agents. We first
propose the Federated Prompt Optimization via Bandits (FedPOB) algorithm, a
federated variant of the Linear UCB algorithm, where agents collaborate by
sharing model parameters instead of raw data. We then extend our approach to
the practical setting of comparative user feedback by introducing FedPOB with
Preference Feedback (FedPOB-Pref), an efficient algorithm based on federated
dueling bandits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both FedPOB and
FedPOB-Pref significantly outperform existing baselines and that their
performance consistently improves as more agents participate in the
collaboration, validating the effectiveness of our federated approach.

Motivation: To address the issue of RLHF reward models failing on longtail distributions, leading to reward hacking and misalignment.

Method: The authors propose a mechanistic interpretability framework, analyze specialized circuits in reward models, and develop Circuit-Aware Reward Training (CART) involving data augmentation, regularization, and model ensembles.

Result: The framework connects the specialization of neural circuits with reward generalization and demonstrates how CART can address longtail issues theoretically and practically.

Conclusion: CART improves robustness and provides insights into and remedies for reward model limitations in longtail distribution scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) reward models exhibit
systematic failures on longtail distributions, leading to reward hacking and
misalignment. We propose a mechanistic interpretability framework that
identifies specialized neural circuits responsible for rare-event processing in
reward models. Drawing from recent advances showing distributed specialization
for rare tokens in language models\citep{liu2025no, liu2025emergent}, we
hypothesize that reward models also develop functionally distinct circuits for
longtail scenarios. Our theoretical framework establishes formal connections
between circuit specialization, reward generalization bounds, and longtail
performance. We introduce \textbf{Circuit-Aware Reward Training (CART)}, which
uses circuit analysis to guide data augmentation, regularization, and ensemble
strategies. This approach provides both theoretical insights into reward model
failures and practical interventions for improving longtail robustness.

*Ting Gao,Elvin Isufi,Winnie Daamen,Erik-Sander Smits,Serge Hoogendoorn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Q-Net, a framework for estimating queue lengths at signalized intersections using vehicle counts and aggregated floating car data (aFCD), outperforming baselines with 60% better Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating queue lengths at signalized intersections under partially observed conditions remains a challenge, requiring an effective solution for traffic management.

Method: The proposed method, Q-Net, integrates vehicle count data and aFCD using a state-space model and KalmanNet, an AI-augmented Kalman filter, allowing it to adapt without prior knowledge of noise or system dynamics while ensuring interpretability.

Result: Evaluations in Rotterdam show that Q-Net improves RMSE by 60%, accurately tracks queue dynamics, and has strong spatial and temporal transferability, making it cost-effective and robust.

Conclusion: Q-Net offers an efficient, interpretable, and cost-effective solution for queue estimation, demonstrating potential for real-time traffic control without expensive infrastructure.

Abstract: Estimating queue lengths at signalized intersections remains a challenge in
traffic management, especially under partially observed conditions where
vehicle flows are not fully captured. This paper introduces Q-Net, a
data-efficient and interpretable framework for queue length estimation that
performs robustly even when traffic conservation assumptions are violated.
Q-Net integrates two widely available and privacy-friendly data sources: (i)
vehicle counts from loop detectors near stop lines, and (ii) aggregated
floating car data (aFCD), which divides each road section into segments and
provides segment-wise average speed measurements. These data sources often
differ in spatial and temporal resolution, creating fusion challenges. Q-Net
addresses this by employing a tailored state-space model and an AI-augmented
Kalman filter, KalmanNet, which learns the Kalman gain from data without
requiring prior knowledge of noise covariances or full system dynamics. We
build on the vanilla KalmanNet pipeline to decouple measurement dimensionality
from section length, enabling spatial transferability across road segments.
Unlike black-box models, Q-Net maintains physical interpretability, with
internal variables linked to real-world traffic dynamics. Evaluations on main
roads in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, demonstrate that Q-Net outperforms
baseline methods by over 60\% in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), accurately
tracking queue formation and dissipation while correcting aFCD-induced delays.
Q-Net also demonstrates strong spatial and temporal transferability, enabling
deployment without costly sensing infrastructure like cameras or radar.
Additionally, we propose a real-time variant of Q-Net, highlighting its
potential for integration into dynamic, queue-based traffic control systems.

### [973] [A TRIANGLE Enables Multimodal Alignment Beyond Cosine Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24734)
*Giordano Cicchetti,Eleonora Grassucci,Danilo Comminiello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRIANGLE, a novel similarity measure for improving multimodal learning by better aligning three modalities, achieving state-of-the-art results with up to 9-point Recall@1 improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in current multimodal models which struggle with effectively aligning multiple modalities, thereby failing to exploit the additional information for downstream tasks.

Method: Developed TRIANGLE, a similarity measure using triangle-area similarity to improve multimodal alignment without additional fusion layers, and applied it in contrastive losses rather than cosine similarity.

Result: TRIANGLE achieved state-of-the-art results across various multimodal tasks (e.g., video-text-audio retrieval), with improvements of up to 9 points in Recall@1.

Conclusion: TRIANGLE offers an effective and interpretable approach to enhance multimodal model alignment, outperforming existing cosine-based methods.

Abstract: Multimodal learning plays a pivotal role in advancing artificial intelligence
systems by incorporating information from multiple modalities to build a more
comprehensive representation. Despite its importance, current state-of-the-art
models still suffer from severe limitations that prevent the successful
development of a fully multimodal model. Such methods may not provide
indicators that all the involved modalities are effectively aligned. As a
result, some modalities may not be aligned, undermining the effectiveness of
the model in downstream tasks where multiple modalities should provide
additional information that the model fails to exploit. In this paper, we
present TRIANGLE: TRI-modAl Neural Geometric LEarning, the novel proposed
similarity measure that is directly computed in the higher-dimensional space
spanned by the modality embeddings. TRIANGLE improves the joint alignment of
three modalities via a triangle-area similarity, avoiding additional fusion
layers or pairwise similarities. When incorporated in contrastive losses
replacing cosine similarity, TRIANGLE significantly boosts the performance of
multimodal modeling, while yielding interpretable alignment rationales.
Extensive evaluation in three-modal tasks such as video-text and audio-text
retrieval or audio-video classification, demonstrates that TRIANGLE achieves
state-of-the-art results across different datasets improving the performance of
cosine-based methods up to 9 points of Recall@1.

### [974] [Robust Policy Expansion for Offline-to-Online RL under Diverse Data Corruption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24748)
*Longxiang He,Deheng Ye,Junbo Tan,Xueqian Wang,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL) faces challenges due to noisy or maliciously corrupted data. The proposed method, RPEX, uses an inverse probability weighting strategy to enhance robustness and achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the robustness of O2O RL under scenarios where data corruption is prevalent, such as noise in offline datasets or maliciously corrupted online interactions, which currently lack exploration in the research.

Method: The paper incorporates Inverse Probability Weighted (IPW) mechanisms into the online exploration phase, addressing the heavy-tailed behaviors induced by data corruption. It then introduces a novel approach called Robust Policy Expansion (RPEX).

Result: RPEX achieves state-of-the-art O2O RL performance across diverse data corruption scenarios using extensive experiments on D4RL datasets.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that mitigating heavy-tailed behaviors in corrupted data through RPEX significantly enhances the efficiency and robustness of O2O RL. The results suggest RPEX is promising for real-world deployment in noisy environments.

Abstract: Pretraining a policy on offline data followed by fine-tuning through online
interactions, known as Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL), has
emerged as a promising paradigm for real-world RL deployment. However, both
offline datasets and online interactions in practical environments are often
noisy or even maliciously corrupted, severely degrading the performance of O2O
RL. Existing works primarily focus on mitigating the conservatism of offline
policies via online exploration, while the robustness of O2O RL under data
corruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics, is still
unexplored. In this work, we observe that data corruption induces heavy-tailed
behavior in the policy, thereby substantially degrading the efficiency of
online exploration. To address this issue, we incorporate Inverse Probability
Weighted (IPW) into the online exploration policy to alleviate
heavy-tailedness, and propose a novel, simple yet effective method termed
$\textbf{RPEX}$: $\textbf{R}$obust $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{EX}$pansion.
Extensive experimental results on D4RL datasets demonstrate that RPEX achieves
SOTA O2O performance across a wide range of data corruption scenarios. Code is

*David Berghaus,Patrick Seifner,Kostadin Cvejoski,César Ojeda,Ramsés J. Sánchez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel pretrained deep neural network approach for modeling multiple event types within marked temporal point processes, achieving comparable performance to specialized models without requiring retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency and versatility of modeling marked temporal point processes (MTPPs) by enabling inference across different systems without training separate models for each one.

Method: The authors pretrain a Foundation Inference Model for Point Processes (FIM-PP) using a synthetic dataset of Hawkes processes, employing in-context learning and amortized inference techniques for estimating conditional intensity functions of event histories.

Result: The pretrained model achieves performance similar to specialized models in next-event prediction tasks across multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating versatility and effectiveness.

Conclusion: This approach showcases the feasibility of a unified, pretrained model for MTPP inference, reducing the need for system-specific models while maintaining predictive quality.

Abstract: Modeling event sequences of multiple event types with marked temporal point
processes (MTPPs) provides a principled way to uncover governing dynamical
rules and predict future events. Current neural network approaches to MTPP
inference rely on training separate, specialized models for each target system.
We pursue a radically different approach: drawing on amortized inference and
in-context learning, we pretrain a deep neural network to infer, in-context,
the conditional intensity functions of event histories from a context defined
by sets of event sequences. Pretraining is performed on a large synthetic
dataset of MTPPs sampled from a broad distribution of Hawkes processes. Once
pretrained, our Foundation Inference Model for Point Processes (FIM-PP) can
estimate MTPPs from real-world data without any additional training, or be
rapidly finetuned to target systems. Experiments show that this amortized
approach matches the performance of specialized models on next-event prediction
across common benchmark datasets.
  Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials will soon be available online

*Fabrizio Frasca,Guy Bar-Shalom,Yftah Ziser,Haggai Maron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs often produce hallucinations. CHARM detects these issues by combining attention maps and activations into attributed graphs and uses GNNs for analysis, outperforming other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the issue of hallucinations in LLMs, which are incorrect or unsupported outputs, by improving current detection methods.

Method: Propose CHARM, which uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) over attributed graphs derived from attention scores and activations to detect hallucinations.

Result: CHARM outperforms leading approaches on diverse benchmarks and demonstrates promising zero-shot performance in cross-dataset settings.

Conclusion: Combining computational traces with graph structures is effective for hallucination detection in LLMs, and CHARM is a significant step forward in this area.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate incorrect or unsupported content,
known as hallucinations. Existing detection methods rely on heuristics or
simple models over isolated computational traces such as activations, or
attention maps. We unify these signals by representing them as attributed
graphs, where tokens are nodes, edges follow attentional flows, and both carry
features from attention scores and activations. Our approach, CHARM, casts
hallucination detection as a graph learning task and tackles it by applying
GNNs over the above attributed graphs. We show that CHARM provably subsumes
prior attention-based heuristics and, experimentally, it consistently
outperforms other leading approaches across diverse benchmarks. Our results
shed light on the relevant role played by the graph structure and on the
benefits of combining computational traces, whilst showing CHARM exhibits
promising zero-shot performance on cross-dataset transfer.

*Kacper Kapuśniak,Cristian Gabellini,Michael Bronstein,Prudencio Tossou,Francesco Di Giovanni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MSM Emulators, a generative model for protein simulations that learns transitions across discrete states defined by Markov State Models (MSM). The specific method, MarS-FM, offers two orders of magnitude speedup and achieves superior performance compared to existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protein functions are studied using molecular dynamics (MD), but MD simulations are computationally expensive due to the integration requirements and long simulation times. There is a need for efficient generative models to reproduce meaningful biomolecular trajectories.

Method: The authors propose MSM Emulators and introduce MarS-FM, a generative model leveraging discrete-state sampling using an underlying MSM. It is benchmarked using structural metrics like RMSD, radius of gyration, and secondary structure content with strict sequence dissimilarity in training and testing datasets.

Result: MarS-FM achieves two orders of magnitude speedup over MD simulations and outperforms existing generative models regarding computational performance and replication of MD statistics across structurally diverse protein domains.

Conclusion: MarS-FM demonstrates its efficacy as a highly efficient and generalizable surrogate model for MD simulations, addressing major limitations of computational expense and fidelity to physical biomolecular events.

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a powerful computational microscope for probing
protein functions. However, the need for fine-grained integration and the long
timescales of biomolecular events make MD computationally expensive. To address
this, several generative models have been proposed to generate surrogate
trajectories at lower cost. Yet, these models typically learn a fixed-lag
transition density, causing the training signal to be dominated by frequent but
uninformative transitions. We introduce a new class of generative models, MSM
Emulators, which instead learn to sample transitions across discrete states
defined by an underlying Markov State Model (MSM). We instantiate this class
with Markov Space Flow Matching (MarS-FM), whose sampling offers more than two
orders of magnitude speedup compared to implicit- or explicit-solvent MD
simulations. We benchmark Mars-FM ability to reproduce MD statistics through
structural observables such as RMSD, radius of gyration, and secondary
structure content. Our evaluation spans protein domains (up to 500 residues)
with significant chemical and structural diversity, including unfolding events,
and enforces strict sequence dissimilarity between training and test sets to
assess generalization. Across all metrics, MarS-FM outperforms existing
methods, often by a substantial margin.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Labyrinth, an environment for benchmarking generalisation in imitation learning, focusing on controlled and reproducible experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning benchmarks often fail to assess meaningful generalization due to insufficient variations between training and testing environments.

Method: Labyrinth is designed with precise control over environmental factors such as start and goal positions, structure, and task complexity. It includes features like fully observable state spaces, optimal actions, partial observability, key-and-door tasks, and ice-floor hazards.

Result: Labyrinth successfully provides distinct and verifiable training, evaluation, and test settings, enabling targeted tests of generalisation factors in imitation learning.

Conclusion: Labyrinth is a valuable tool for advancing generalisation evaluation and for developing robust agents in imitation learning.

Abstract: Imitation learning benchmarks often lack sufficient variation between
training and evaluation, limiting meaningful generalisation assessment. We
introduce Labyrinth, a benchmarking environment designed to test generalisation
with precise control over structure, start and goal positions, and task
complexity. It enables verifiably distinct training, evaluation, and test
settings. Labyrinth provides a discrete, fully observable state space and known
optimal actions, supporting interpretability and fine-grained evaluation. Its
flexible setup allows targeted testing of generalisation factors and includes
variants like partial observability, key-and-door tasks, and ice-floor hazards.
By enabling controlled, reproducible experiments, Labyrinth advances the
evaluation of generalisation in imitation learning and provides a valuable tool
for developing more robust agents.

*Felix Strnad,Jonathan Schmidt,Fabian Mockert,Philipp Hennig,Nicole Ludwig*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines how Dunkelflaute events, which impact wind and solar power generation, will affect German electricity production under future climate scenarios. Using a generative deep learning model and CMIP6 climate simulations, it finds that these events' frequency and duration are projected to remain stable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address concerns about grid stability in Germany as the power grid transitions to renewable energy sources like wind and solar, which are weather-dependent.

Method: The authors adapted a generative deep learning framework to downscale CMIP6 climate simulations and compared the results to historical data from ERA5. They assessed Dunkelflaute event occurrences under optimistic (SSP2-4.5) and high (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios.

Result: The findings indicate that the frequency and duration of Dunkelflaute events in Germany are expected to remain largely unchanged throughout the century under the assessed climate scenarios.

Conclusion: Under both optimistic and high emission scenarios, climate-related risks to German electricity production from Dunkelflaute events are projected to stay stable, helping mitigate concerns about renewable energy variability's impact on grid stability.

Abstract: The European electricity power grid is transitioning towards renewable energy
sources, characterized by an increasing share of off- and onshore wind and
solar power. However, the weather dependency of these energy sources poses a
challenge to grid stability, with so-called Dunkelflaute events -- periods of
low wind and solar power generation -- being of particular concern due to their
potential to cause electricity supply shortages. In this study, we investigate
the impact of these events on the German electricity production in the years
and decades to come. For this purpose, we adapt a recently developed generative
deep learning framework to downscale climate simulations from the CMIP6
ensemble. We first compare their statistics to the historical record taken from
ERA5 data. Next, we use these downscaled simulations to assess plausible future
occurrences of Dunkelflaute events in Germany under the optimistic low
(SSP2-4.5) and high (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios. Our analysis indicates that
both the frequency and duration of Dunkelflaute events in Germany in the
ensemble mean are projected to remain largely unchanged compared to the
historical period. This suggests that, under the considered climate scenarios,
the associated risk is expected to remain stable throughout the century.

*Zixu Wang,Hongbin Dong,Xiaoping Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DSAT-HD, a novel Transformer-based model for time series forecasting that combines advanced decomposition, multi-scale adaptive processing, and dual-stream residual learning, significantly outperforming earlier methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in current time series forecasting methods, which struggle to capture diverse features across varied scales and rely on fixed seasonal periods.

Method: The DSAT-HD model incorporates three main approaches: hybrid decomposition using EMA and Fourier with RevIN normalization, a multi-scale adaptive Transformer pathway using sparse allocation and hybrid attention, and a dual-stream framework for seasonal/trend decomposition with coordinated residual learning.

Result: DSAT-HD outperforms existing methods on nine datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on several, with improved generalization across different transfer scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed DSAT-HD model effectively advances time series forecasting capabilities, overcoming key limitations in existing approaches by providing a more adaptable and accurate prediction framework.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial for various applications, such as weather,
traffic, electricity, and energy predictions. Currently, common time series
forecasting methods are based on Transformers. However, existing approaches
primarily model limited time series or fixed scales, making it more challenging
to capture diverse features cross different ranges. Additionally, traditional
methods like STL for complex seasonality-trend decomposition require
pre-specified seasonal periods and typically handle only single, fixed
seasonality. We propose the Hybrid Decomposition Dual-Stream Adaptive
Transformer (DSAT-HD), which integrates three key innovations to address the
limitations of existing methods: 1) A hybrid decomposition mechanism combining
EMA and Fourier decomposition with RevIN normalization, dynamically balancing
seasonal and trend components through noise Top-k gating; 2) A multi-scale
adaptive pathway leveraging a sparse allocator to route features to four
parallel Transformer layers, followed by feature merging via a sparse combiner,
enhanced by hybrid attention combining local CNNs and global interactions; 3) A
dual-stream residual learning framework where CNN and MLP branches separately
process seasonal and trend components, coordinated by a balanced loss function
minimizing expert collaboration variance. Extensive experiments on nine
datasets demonstrate that DSAT-HD outperforms existing methods overall and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on some datasets. Notably, it also
exhibits stronger generalization capabilities across various transfer
scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how integrating domain-specific physics knowledge affects learning rates in machine learning, particularly with dependent data, showing improvements when priors are well-aligned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of how incorporating physical prior knowledge impacts learning rates in machine learning for dependent data.

Method: The authors use empirical risk minimization with physics-informed regularization and derive complexity-dependent bounds on excess risk.

Result: They prove that aligned physical prior information accelerates learning rates from slow Sobolev minimax rates to faster optimal iid rates without sample-size penalties for data dependence.

Conclusion: Physics-informed regularization is effective in improving learning rates without deflation from data dependence when prior information is aligned.

Abstract: A major challenge in physics-informed machine learning is to understand how
the incorporation of prior domain knowledge affects learning rates when data
are dependent. Focusing on empirical risk minimization with physics-informed
regularization, we derive complexity-dependent bounds on the excess risk in
probability and in expectation. We prove that, when the physical prior
information is aligned, the learning rate improves from the (slow) Sobolev
minimax rate to the (fast) optimal i.i.d. one without any sample-size deflation
due to data dependence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DyMoDreamer, a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, enhances sample efficiency by focusing on dynamic features and temporal information, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses sample inefficiency in deep reinforcement learning, particularly in visual tasks, where conventional world models fail to decouple dynamic objects and temporal features from static backgrounds.

Method: DyMoDreamer leverages a dynamic modulation mechanism and inter-frame differencing mask integrated into a recurrent state-space model to extract dynamic features and encode object-level motion cues.

Result: The algorithm achieves a 156.6% human-normalized score on Atari $100$k, sets a new record of $832$ on DeepMind Visual Control Suite, and improves performance on the Crafter benchmark by $9.5$
t.

Conclusion: DyMoDreamer enhances model-based reinforcement learning methods, significantly improving sample efficiency and reward-relevant dynamics.

Abstract: A critical bottleneck in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is sample
inefficiency, as training high-performance agents often demands extensive
environmental interactions. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) mitigates
this by building world models that simulate environmental dynamics and generate
synthetic experience, improving sample efficiency. However, conventional world
models process observations holistically, failing to decouple dynamic objects
and temporal features from static backgrounds. This approach is computationally
inefficient, especially for visual tasks where dynamic objects significantly
influence rewards and decision-making performance. To address this, we
introduce DyMoDreamer, a novel MBRL algorithm that incorporates a dynamic
modulation mechanism to improve the extraction of dynamic features and enrich
the temporal information. DyMoDreamer employs differential observations derived
from a novel inter-frame differencing mask, explicitly encoding object-level
motion cues and temporal dynamics. Dynamic modulation is modeled as stochastic
categorical distributions and integrated into a recurrent state-space model
(RSSM), enhancing the model's focus on reward-relevant dynamics. Experiments
demonstrate that DyMoDreamer sets a new state-of-the-art on the Atari $100$k
benchmark with a $156.6$\% mean human-normalized score, establishes a new
record of $832$ on the DeepMind Visual Control Suite, and gains a $9.5$\%
performance improvement after $1$M steps on the Crafter benchmark. Our code is
released at https://github.com/Ultraman-Tiga1/DyMoDreamer.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Cell2Text, a system that generates natural language descriptions from single-cell RNA sequencing data using a multimodal generative approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-cell foundation models lack the capability to provide rich, contextual descriptions of cellular data, which are crucial for deeper biological understanding.

Method: Cell2Text integrates gene-level embeddings from single-cell models with pretrained large language models to generate structured natural language outputs.

Result: Cell2Text performed better than benchmarks in classification accuracy, PageRank-based ontological consistency, and semantic fidelity in text generation.

Conclusion: Cell2Text offers stronger predictive accuracy and interpretability, enabling scalable and efficient characterization of unseen cellular profiles.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed biology by enabling the
measurement of gene expression at cellular resolution, providing information
for cell types, states, and disease contexts. Recently, single-cell foundation
models have emerged as powerful tools for learning transferable representations
directly from expression profiles, improving performance on classification and
clustering tasks. However, these models are limited to discrete prediction
heads, which collapse cellular complexity into predefined labels that fail to
capture the richer, contextual explanations biologists need. We introduce
Cell2Text, a multimodal generative framework that translates scRNA-seq profiles
into structured natural language descriptions. By integrating gene-level
embeddings from single-cell foundation models with pretrained large language
models, Cell2Text generates coherent summaries that capture cellular identity,
tissue origin, disease associations, and pathway activity, generalizing to
unseen cells. Empirically, Cell2Text outperforms baselines on classification
accuracy, demonstrates strong ontological consistency using PageRank-based
similarity metrics, and achieves high semantic fidelity in text generation.
These results demonstrate that coupling expression data with natural language
offers both stronger predictive performance and inherently interpretable
outputs, pointing to a scalable path for label-efficient characterization of
unseen cells.

*Christos Mountzouris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the determinants of a track's inclusion in the Billboard Hot 100 charts, finding streaming popularity as the strongest predictor, with models achieving high accuracy (Logistic Regression at 90%, Random Forest at 90.4%, and Gradient Boosting at 90.3%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand what factors influence a track's inclusion in the Billboard Hot 100 charts by leveraging structured data made available through digital music streaming platforms.

Method: The study uses predictive modeling techniques (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to analyze the relationship between audio signal attributes, streaming data, and human listening metrics with Billboard inclusion.

Result: The models achieved high accuracy (Logistic Regression: 90%, Random Forest: 90.4%, Gradient Boosting: 90.3%), with streaming popularity as the most decisive predictor along with other audio features.

Conclusion: The findings confirm the primary role of streaming popularity in chart success and demonstrate that predictive models can effectively identify the key factors influencing track popularity.

Abstract: The advent of digital streaming platforms have recently revolutionized the
landscape of music industry, with the ensuing digitalization providing
structured data collections that open new research avenues for investigating
popularity dynamics and mainstream success. The present work explored which
determinants hold the strongest predictive influence for a track's inclusion in
the Billboard Hot 100 charts, including streaming popularity, measurable audio
signal attributes, and probabilistic indicators of human listening. The
analysis revealed that popularity was by far the most decisive predictor of
Billboard Hot 100 inclusion, with considerable contribution from
instrumentalness, valence, duration and speechiness. Logistic Regression
achieved 90.0% accuracy, with very high recall for charting singles (0.986) but
lower recall for non-charting ones (0.813), yielding balanced F1-scores around
0.90. Random Forest slightly improved performance to 90.4% accuracy,
maintaining near-perfect precision for non-charting singles (0.990) and high
recall for charting ones (0.992), with F1-scores up to 0.91. Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) reached 90.3% accuracy, delivering a more balanced trade-off by
improving recall for non-charting singles (0.837) while sustaining high recall
for charting ones (0.969), resulting in F1-scores comparable to the other
models.

*Jiayi Li,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRIFT-Net is proposed as a neural solver for PDEs, combining a dual-branch design to handle global and local dynamics, outperforming attention-based baselines in error and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address weaknesses in global coupling and error accumulation found in existing attention-based PDE solvers.

Method: A dual-branch design integrating a spectral branch for global dynamics and an image branch for local details, with controlled mixing and bandwise weighting.

Result: DRIFT-Net reduced relative L1 error by 7%-54%, decreased parameter count by about 15%, and maintained higher throughput compared to strong baselines on Navier-Stokes benchmarks.

Conclusion: DRIFT-Net enhances global and local representations for PDEs, offering significant gains in accuracy, efficiency, and stability over prior models.

Abstract: Learning PDE dynamics with neural solvers can significantly improve
wall-clock efficiency and accuracy compared with classical numerical solvers.
In recent years, foundation models for PDEs have largely adopted multi-scale
windowed self-attention, with the scOT backbone in \textsc{Poseidon} serving as
a representative example.
  However, because of their locality, truly globally consistent spectral
coupling can only be propagated gradually through deep stacking and window
shifting. This weakens global coupling and leads to error accumulation and
drift during closed-loop rollouts. To address this, we propose
\textbf{DRIFT-Net}. It employs a dual-branch design comprising a spectral
branch and an image branch. The spectral branch is responsible for capturing
global, large-scale low-frequency information, whereas the image branch focuses
on local details and nonstationary structures. Specifically, we first perform
controlled, lightweight mixing within the low-frequency range. Then we fuse the
spectral and image paths at each layer via bandwise weighting, which avoids the
width inflation and training instability caused by naive concatenation. The
fused result is transformed back into the spatial domain and added to the image
branch, thereby preserving both global structure and high-frequency details
across scales. Compared with strong attention-based baselines, DRIFT-Net
achieves lower error and higher throughput with fewer parameters under
identical training settings and budget. On Navier--Stokes benchmarks, the
relative $L_{1}$ error is reduced by 7\%--54\%, the parameter count decreases
by about 15\%, and the throughput remains higher than scOT. Ablation studies
and theoretical analyses further demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of
this design. The code is available at

### [987] [Uncertainty-Guided Expert-AI Collaboration for Efficient Soil Horizon Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24873)
*Teodor Chiaburu,Vipin Singh,Frank Haußer,Felix Bießmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores conformal prediction for uncertainty calibration in machine learning during human-machine collaboration, utilizing a multimodal multitask model, SoilNet, and a simulated human-in-the-loop annotation process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve human-machine collaboration by enabling reliably calibrated model uncertainties for efficient expert interventions, particularly within the domain of soil profile descriptions.

Method: The paper applies conformal prediction to SoilNet, introducing a simulated human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline with limited ground truth data acquisition under high model uncertainty.

Result: Using conformalized SoilNet, the study achieves more efficient annotations in regression tasks while maintaining comparable classification performance under the same annotation budget as its non-conformal counterpart.

Conclusion: Conformal prediction enhances the efficiency and reliability of human-in-the-loop annotations without compromising performance, proving effective for uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential in human-machine collaboration, as
human agents tend to adjust their decisions based on the confidence of the
machine counterpart. Reliably calibrated model uncertainties, hence, enable
more effective collaboration, targeted expert intervention and more responsible
usage of Machine Learning (ML) systems. Conformal prediction has become a well
established model-agnostic framework for uncertainty calibration of ML models,
offering statistically valid confidence estimates for both regression and
classification tasks. In this work, we apply conformal prediction to
$\textit{SoilNet}$, a multimodal multitask model for describing soil profiles.
We design a simulated human-in-the-loop (HIL) annotation pipeline, where a
limited budget for obtaining ground truth annotations from domain experts is
available when model uncertainty is high. Our experiments show that
conformalizing SoilNet leads to more efficient annotation in regression tasks
and comparable performance scores in classification tasks under the same
annotation budget when tested against its non-conformal counterpart. All code

### [988] [Adaptive Canonicalization with Application to Invariant Anisotropic Geometric Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24886)
*Ya-Wei Eileen Lin,Ron Levie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces adaptive canonicalization, a method that adjusts standard forms based on input and network to enhance stability, generalization, and universal approximation in equivariant machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address discontinuities and limitations introduced by conventional canonicalization techniques in equivariant machine learning.

Method: Adaptive canonicalization selects a standard form of input that maximizes the network's predictive confidence, ensuring continuity and symmetry compliance.

Result: The framework improves model performance in molecular/protein classification and point cloud classification, surpassing data augmentation, traditional canonicalization, and equivariant architectures.

Conclusion: Adaptive canonicalization offers a robust, universal, and effective solution to tackle challenges in equivariant machine learning, proving to be superior in practical applications.

Abstract: Canonicalization is a widely used strategy in equivariant machine learning,
enforcing symmetry in neural networks by mapping each input to a standard form.
Yet, it often introduces discontinuities that can affect stability during
training, limit generalization, and complicate universal approximation
theorems. In this paper, we address this by introducing \emph{adaptive
canonicalization}, a general framework in which the canonicalization depends
both on the input and the network. Specifically, we present the adaptive
canonicalization based on prior maximization, where the standard form of the
input is chosen to maximize the predictive confidence of the network. We prove
that this construction yields continuous and symmetry-respecting models that
admit universal approximation properties.
  We propose two applications of our setting: (i) resolving eigenbasis
ambiguities in spectral graph neural networks, and (ii) handling rotational
symmetries in point clouds. We empirically validate our methods on molecular
and protein classification, as well as point cloud classification tasks. Our
adaptive canonicalization outperforms the three other common solutions to
equivariant machine learning: data augmentation, standard canonicalization, and
equivariant architectures.

### [989] [Towards Understanding the Shape of Representations in Protein Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24895)
*Kosio Beshkov,Anders Malthe-Sørenssen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies the transformed space of protein sequences in Protein Language Models (PLMs) using square-root velocity representations and graph filtrations, revealing insights into their encoding capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PLMs are crucial tools for protein design, but their mechanisms for transforming sequences into hidden representations are not well understood, necessitating interpretability tools to explore their functionality.

Method: Square-root velocity representations and graph filtrations are utilized to define metric spaces to compare protein representations and analyze structural encoding in PLMs.

Result: PLMs encode structural features effectively up to a certain context length, with optimal encoding occurring before the final layer. Overly large context lengths degrade their encoding performance.

Conclusion: These findings suggest the potential for improved protein folding models by leveraging intermediate layers of PLMs, which most faithfully encode structural relations.

Abstract: While protein language models (PLMs) are one of the most promising avenues of
research for future de novo protein design, the way in which they transform
sequences to hidden representations, as well as the information encoded in such
representations is yet to be fully understood. Several works have attempted to
propose interpretability tools for PLMs, but they have focused on understanding
how individual sequences are transformed by such models. Therefore, the way in
which PLMs transform the whole space of sequences along with their relations is
still unknown. In this work we attempt to understand this transformed space of
sequences by identifying protein structure and representation with square-root
velocity (SRV) representations and graph filtrations. Both approaches naturally
lead to a metric space in which pairs of proteins or protein representations
can be compared with each other.
  We analyze different types of proteins from the SCOP dataset and show that
the Karcher mean and effective dimension of the SRV shape space follow a
non-linear pattern as a function of the layers in ESM2 models of different
sizes. Furthermore, we use graph filtrations as a tool to study the context
lengths at which models encode the structural features of proteins. We find
that PLMs preferentially encode immediate as well as local relations between
residues, but start to degrade for larger context lengths. The most
structurally faithful encoding tends to occur close to, but before the last
layer of the models, indicating that training a folding model ontop of these
layers might lead to improved folding performance.

*Sanxing Chen,Xiaoyin Chen,Yukun Huang,Roy Xie,Bhuwan Dhingra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study examines how fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) impacts exploration strategies in decision-making tasks. It finds RL and SFT methods improve performance but promote exploitation over exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in exploration capabilities of LLMs in sequential decision-making tasks and understand the impact of various training methods.

Method: Train LLMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) with tailored reward signals, including regret-shaped and algorithmic rewards, and evaluate their performance on multi-armed bandit problems.

Result: Agents trained using RL and SFT outperform pre-trained models, achieving performance comparable to algorithmic baselines like UCB and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to longer decision horizons.

Conclusion: Tailored reward design and methods beyond average regret evaluation are crucial to foster robust exploration behavior while balancing exploitation tendencies in LLMs.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise to become autonomous agents,
they often explore suboptimally in sequential decision-making. Recent work has
sought to enhance this capability via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or
reinforcement learning (RL), improving regret on the classic multi-armed bandit
task. However, it remains unclear how these learning methods shape exploration
strategies and how well they generalize. We investigate both paradigms by
training LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories and RL with a range of tailored
reward signals including a strategic, regret-shaped reward to reduce variance,
and an algorithmic reward that enables oracle imitation. The resulting agents
outperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6x
longer horizons and across bandit families. Behavioral analysis reveals that
gains often stem from more sophisticated but greedier exploitation: RL/SFT
agents are more prone to early catastrophic failure than pre-trained models,
prematurely abandoning exploration. Furthermore, agents trained to imitate UCB
learn to outperform their teacher by adopting more exploitative variants. Our
findings clarify when each training paradigm is preferable and advocate
tailored reward design and evaluation beyond average regret to promote robust
exploratory behavior.

### [991] [Is Sequence Information All You Need for Bayesian Optimization of Antibodies?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24933)
*Sebastian W. Ober,Calvin McCarter,Aniruddh Raghu,Yucen Lily Li,Alan N. Amin,Andrew Gordon Wilson,Hunter Elliott*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how to enhance Bayesian optimization for antibody engineering by incorporating structural information and using protein language model-based soft constraints. Results highlight that structural information improves early optimization for stability, but the soft constraint reduces reliance on structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of optimizing antibody therapeutic properties, which is costly and requires iterative processes, and to evaluate whether structural information or sequence-only methods are better suited for this purpose.

Method: The authors compared Bayesian optimization approaches using structural and sequence-only information for antibody properties like binding affinity and stability. They also introduced a protein language model-based soft constraint to guide the optimization process.

Result: Structural information boosts early optimization efficiency for stability but offers no better peak performance. Protein language model constraints reduce the need for structure, allowing sequence-only methods to achieve comparable performance.

Conclusion: Structural information is potentially useful during initial optimization rounds, but its necessity diminishes when protein language model-based constraints are applied, challenging its overall utility in Bayesian optimization for antibodies.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a natural candidate for the engineering of antibody
therapeutic properties, which is often iterative and expensive. However,
finding the optimal choice of surrogate model for optimization over the highly
structured antibody space is difficult, and may differ depending on the
property being optimized. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no prior
works have attempted to incorporate structural information into antibody
Bayesian optimization. In this work, we explore different approaches to
incorporating structural information into Bayesian optimization, and compare
them to a variety of sequence-only approaches on two different antibody
properties, binding affinity and stability. In addition, we propose the use of
a protein language model-based ``soft constraint,'' which helps guide the
optimization to promising regions of the space. We find that certain types of
structural information improve data efficiency in early optimization rounds for
stability, but have equivalent peak performance. Moreover, when incorporating
the protein language model soft constraint we find that the data efficiency gap
is diminished for affinity and eliminated for stability, resulting in
sequence-only methods that match the performance of structure-based methods,
raising questions about the necessity of structure in Bayesian optimization for
antibodies.

*Angxiao Yue,Anqi Dong,Hongteng Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces OAT-FM, a method that improves upon the Flow Matching technique for generative modeling by incorporating Optimal Acceleration Transport theory, leading to more efficient and effective generative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in Flow Matching (FM) methods for generative modeling by integrating concepts of Optimal Acceleration Transport (OAT) for more efficient and accurate performance.

Method: The authors derive a connection between FM and OAT, enabling the optimization of acceleration transport rather than constant velocity in the product space of sample and velocity. They propose a two-phase FM paradigm and design a low-complexity algorithm for implementation.

Result: OAT-FM eliminates risks of data distribution drift and reduces the need for excessive noise data generation, consistently enhancing performance in various generative modeling tasks.

Conclusion: OAT-FM, grounded in OAT theory, represents an advancement over traditional FM methods, offering improved reliability and generative model fine-tuning with significant practical benefits.

Abstract: As a powerful technique in generative modeling, Flow Matching (FM) aims to
learn velocity fields from noise to data, which is often explained and
implemented as solving Optimal Transport (OT) problems. In this study, we
bridge FM and the recent theory of Optimal Acceleration Transport (OAT),
developing an improved FM method called OAT-FM and exploring its benefits in
both theory and practice. In particular, we demonstrate that the straightening
objective hidden in existing OT-based FM methods is mathematically equivalent
to minimizing the physical action associated with acceleration defined by OAT.
Accordingly, instead of enforcing constant velocity, OAT-FM optimizes the
acceleration transport in the product space of sample and velocity, whose
objective corresponds to a necessary and sufficient condition of flow
straightness. An efficient algorithm is designed to achieve OAT-FM with low
complexity. OAT-FM motivates a new two-phase FM paradigm: Given a generative
model trained by an arbitrary FM method, whose velocity information has been
relatively reliable, we can fine-tune and improve it via OAT-FM. This paradigm
eliminates the risk of data distribution drift and the need to generate a large
number of noise data pairs, which consistently improves model performance in
various generative tasks. Code is available at:

*Sooraj Sathish,Keshav Goyal,Raghuram Bharadwaj Diddigi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates transfer learning in deep RL by using state representations for simpler models, identifies challenges with representation correlations, and proposes a novel regularized Q-learning approach to address them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep RL faces challenges like hyperparameter tuning and computational costs. Transfer learning can reduce these burdens by reusing knowledge from past tasks.

Method: The paper introduces a regularized deep Q-learning framework that decorrelates state representations, enabling better transfer learning using linear function approximators.

Result: Experiments on standard RL benchmarks and MinAtar games show improved transfer learning performance and reduced computational overhead with the proposed approach.

Conclusion: By reducing feature correlation in state representations, the proposed method enhances transfer learning efficacy, supporting simpler models while reducing resource use.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated success in solving complex
sequential decision-making problems by integrating neural networks with the RL
framework. However, training deep RL models poses several challenges, such as
the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning and high computational costs.
Transfer learning has emerged as a promising strategy to address these
challenges by enabling the reuse of knowledge from previously learned tasks for
new, related tasks. This avoids the need for retraining models entirely from
scratch. A commonly used approach for transfer learning in RL is to leverage
the internal representations learned by the neural network during training.
Specifically, the activations from the last hidden layer can be viewed as
refined state representations that encapsulate the essential features of the
input. In this work, we investigate whether these representations can be used
as input for training simpler models, such as linear function approximators, on
new tasks. We observe that the representations learned by standard deep RL
models can be highly correlated, which limits their effectiveness when used
with linear function approximation. To mitigate this problem, we propose a
novel deep Q-learning approach that introduces a regularization term to reduce
positive correlations between feature representation of states. By leveraging
these reduced correlated features, we enable more effective use of linear
function approximation in transfer learning. Through experiments and ablation
studies on standard RL benchmarks and MinAtar games, we demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach in improving transfer learning performance and thereby
reducing computational overhead.

*Weifan Jiang,Rana Shahout,Yilun Du,Michael Mitzenmacher,Minlan Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DUCHESS is a system for serving LLMs that reduces token usage, cost, and latency while maintaining accuracy using branch orchestration and latency optimization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the high token usage and latency associated with inference-time reasoning algorithms in LLMs, seeking to balance efficiency and accuracy.

Method: DUCHESS uses a linear probing model to predict branch correctness and employs an orchestration policy to optimize the termination, duplication, or continuation of reasoning branches. Additionally, it prioritizes easier tasks first to improve multi-request latency.

Result: DUCHESS achieves a 42-63% reduction in token usage without sacrificing accuracy and dramatically lowers latency across various metrics (mean, median, and tail latencies) on reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: DUCHESS successfully improves the efficiency of LLM serving, pushing the token-accuracy tradeoff frontier further while reducing latency during high-demand scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on inference-time reasoning
algorithms such as chain-of-thought and multi-branch reasoning to improve
accuracy on complex tasks. These methods, however, substantially increase token
usage and per-request latency. Prior work has largely focused on reducing token
usage, often at the expense of accuracy, while overlooking other latency
factors. We present DUCHESS, an LLM serving system that reduces cost and
latency without sacrificing accuracy through intra-request branch orchestration
guided by predictions. DUCHESS employs a lightweight linear probing model over
LLM layer activations to estimate branch correctness, and its orchestration
policy decides whether to terminate, duplicate, or continue a branch. When
handling multiple requests, DUCHESS further reduces latency by prioritizing
easier reasoning tasks when complexity can be estimated from the prompt.
Experiments on three reasoning benchmarks show that DUCHESS consistently
improves the token-accuracy Pareto frontier, reducing token usage by 42-63% at
matched accuracy compared to self-consistency. In serving with vLLM, DUCHESS
reduces mean, median, and tail latencies by 57-81%, 58-85%, and 52-84% with
First-Come-First-Served scheduling, and achieves additional gains under
difficulty-aware scheduling at higher request rates.

*Ahmad Fraij,Sam Dauncey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Autoregressive models are more sample-efficient for small-scale datasets, while discrete diffusion models require larger capacity and compute to become competitive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sample efficiency is crucial in addressing the challenges of data scarcity and ensuring effective performance of large language models.

Method: This study leverages the double descent phenomenon to evaluate the sample efficiency of discrete diffusion versus autoregressive models using metrics like training epochs, capacity, and test loss trends.

Result: Differences observed include discrete diffusion models needing larger capacity and training cycles to escape underparameterization. Both model types exhibit similar behavior in overparameterized conditions without pronounced test loss improvements.

Conclusion: Autoregressive models are better for smaller datasets due to their sample efficiency, whereas discrete diffusion models require significant resources to achieve competitive performance.

Abstract: Data scarcity drives the need for more sample-efficient large language
models. In this work, we use the double descent phenomenon to holistically
compare the sample efficiency of discrete diffusion and autoregressive models.
We show that discrete diffusion models require larger capacity and more
training epochs to escape their underparameterized regime and reach the
interpolation threshold. In the strongly overparameterized regime, both models
exhibit similar behavior, with neither exhibiting a pronounced second descent
in test loss across a large range of model sizes. Overall, our results indicate
that autoregressive models are more sample-efficient on small-scale datasets,
while discrete diffusion models only become competitive when given sufficient
capacity and compute.

*Haoran He,Yuxiao Ye,Qingpeng Cai,Chen Hu,Binxing Jiao,Daxin Jiang,Ling Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ROVER, a simplified RL approach for math reasoning in large language models, outperforming existing methods in quality and diversity by leveraging Q-values from a uniform random policy instead of traditional optimization loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods like PPO and GRPO for reasoning in LLMs suffer from instability, complexity, and diversity collapse, necessitating a simpler yet effective alternative.

Method: The authors formalize RLVR as a specialized Markov Decision Process and prove that optimal actions can be derived from the Q-function of a random policy. They present ROVER, which uses softmax over these Q-values for reasoning in LLMs, avoiding traditional policy iteration.

Result: ROVER achieves superior math reasoning performance across quality (+8.2 pass@1, +16.8 pass@256) and diversity (+17.6%), outperforming more complex RL methods while being simpler to train and implement.

Conclusion: ROVER offers a minimalist yet highly effective framework for RL in LLM-based reasoning, addressing instability and complexity challenges while enhancing performance and diversity.

Abstract: RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Current
methods rely primarily on policy optimization frameworks like PPO and GRPO,
which follow generalized policy iteration that alternates between evaluating
the current policy's value and improving the policy based on evaluation. While
effective, they often suffer from training instability and diversity collapse,
requiring complex heuristic tricks and careful tuning. We observe that standard
RLVR in math reasoning can be formalized as a specialized finite-horizon Markov
Decision Process with deterministic state transitions, tree-structured
dynamics, and binary terminal rewards. Though large in scale, the underlying
structure is simpler than general-purpose control settings for which popular RL
algorithms (e.g., PPO) were developed, suggesting that several sophisticated
techniques in existing methods may be reduced or even omitted. Based on this
insight, we prove a surprising result: the optimal action can be recovered from
the Q-function of a fixed uniformly random policy, thereby bypassing the
generalized policy iteration loop and its associated heuristics. We introduce
Random Policy Valuation for Diverse Reasoning (ROVER) to translate this
principle into a practical and scalable algorithm for LLM math reasoning, a
minimalist yet highly effective RL method that samples actions from a softmax
over these uniform-policy Q-values. ROVER preserves diversity throughout
training, allowing sustained exploration of multiple valid pathways. Across
multiple base models and standard math reasoning benchmarks, ROVER demonstrates
superior performance in both \textbf{quality} (\textbf{+8.2} on pass@1,
\textbf{+16.8} on pass@256) and \textbf{diversity} (\textbf{+17.6\%}), despite
its radical simplification compared to strong, complicated existing methods.

*Lu Zou,Wendi Ren,Weizhong Zhang,Liang Ding,Shuang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper revisits Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) using a function-space perspective in RKHS, improving theoretical grounding and practical efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a stronger theoretical foundation for PPO beyond finite-dimensional assumptions and improve its practical stability and efficiency.

Method: The paper uses RKHS: decoupling policy evaluation and improvement via a kernelized TD critic for efficient updates, with a KL-regularized natural-gradient policy step that mimics PPO/TRPO-style updates in continuous spaces.

Result: The proposed method offers non-asymptotic guarantees related to RKHS entropy, achieves optimal convergence rates, improves empirical stability and sample efficiency on control tasks, and enhances critic throughput compared to baselines.

Conclusion: RKHS-proximal updates with kernel-TD critics solidify PPO's theoretical foundation and offer global policy improvement with practical efficiency in continuous state-action spaces.

Abstract: We revisit Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) from a function-space
perspective. Our analysis decouples policy evaluation and improvement in a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS): (i) A kernelized temporal-difference
(TD) critic performs efficient RKHS-gradient updates using only one-step
state-action transition samples; (ii) a KL-regularized, natural-gradient policy
step exponentiates the evaluated action-value, recovering a PPO/TRPO-style
proximal update in continuous state-action spaces. We provide non-asymptotic,
instance-adaptive guarantees whose rates depend on RKHS entropy, unifying
tabular, linear, Sobolev, Gaussian, and Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regimes,
and we derive a sampling rule for the proximal update that ensures the optimal
$k^{-1/2}$ convergence rate for stochastic optimization. Empirically, the
theory-aligned schedule improves stability and sample efficiency on common
control tasks (e.g., CartPole, Acrobot), while our TD-based critic attains
favorable throughput versus a GAE baseline. Altogether, our results place PPO
on a firmer theoretical footing beyond finite-dimensional assumptions and
clarify when RKHS-proximal updates with kernel-TD critics yield global policy
improvement with practical efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand and mitigate privacy risks posed by diffusion models, particularly how they may reveal training data membership.

Method: They conduct theoretical and empirical studies analyzing the predicted noise vectors used by diffusion models, and propose a single-query attack method called SimA. They also compare vulnerabilities across model types and analyze effects of regularization in latent space.

Result: SimA demonstrates strong performance across different diffusion model variants. Latent Diffusion Models are found to be less vulnerable than pixel-space models, and adjusting latent space regularization improves robustness to MIAs.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a theoretical framework for score-based MIAs, highlights the distinct vulnerabilities of Latent Diffusion Models, and proposes strategies for improving their privacy robustness.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) against diffusion models have emerged as
a pressing privacy concern, as these models may inadvertently reveal whether a
given sample was part of their training set. We present a theoretical and
empirical study of score-based MIAs, focusing on the predicted noise vectors
that diffusion models learn to approximate. We show that the expected denoiser
output points toward a kernel-weighted local mean of nearby training samples,
such that its norm encodes proximity to the training set and thereby reveals
membership. Building on this observation, we propose SimA, a single-query
attack that provides a principled, efficient alternative to existing
multi-query methods. SimA achieves consistently strong performance across
variants of DDPM, Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Notably, we find that Latent
Diffusion Models are surprisingly less vulnerable than pixel-space models, due
to the strong information bottleneck imposed by their latent auto-encoder. We
further investigate this by differing the regularization hyperparameters
($\beta$ in $\beta$-VAE) in latent channel and suggest a strategy to make LDM
training more robust to MIA. Our results solidify the theory of score-based
MIAs, while highlighting that Latent Diffusion class of methods requires better
understanding of inversion for VAE, and not simply inversion of the Diffusion
process

*Spyros Kondylatos,Gustau Camps-Valls,Ioannis Papoutsis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an uncertainty-aware deep learning framework for wildfire danger prediction, improving both the accuracy and reliability by modeling epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wildfires pose significant threats, and the growing risk demands forecasting models that are accurate and reliable. Current Deep Learning methods lack uncertainty quantification, limiting trust in their predictions.

Method: The framework jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties to enhance wildfire danger forecasts. Experiments include next-day to ten-day forecasting, incorporating uncertainty thresholds and generating calibrated danger maps.

Result: The model achieved a 2.3% improvement in F1 Score and a 2.1% reduction in Expected Calibration Error compared to a deterministic baseline. Reliability and practicality of the uncertainty estimates were validated.

Conclusion: The joint modeling of uncertainties significantly enhances the performance and trustworthiness of wildfire forecasting, offering tools for better decision support and advancing DL-based solutions in this domain.

Abstract: Wildfires are among the most severe natural hazards, posing a significant
threat to both humans and natural ecosystems. The growing risk of wildfires
increases the demand for forecasting models that are not only accurate but also
reliable. Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise in predicting wildfire danger;
however, its adoption is hindered by concerns over the reliability of its
predictions, some of which stem from the lack of uncertainty quantification. To
address this challenge, we present an uncertainty-aware DL framework that
jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty to enhance
short-term wildfire danger forecasting. In the next-day forecasting, our
best-performing model improves the F1 Score by 2.3% and reduces the Expected
Calibration Error by 2.1% compared to a deterministic baseline, enhancing both
predictive skill and calibration. Our experiments confirm the reliability of
the uncertainty estimates and illustrate their practical utility for decision
support, including the identification of uncertainty thresholds for rejecting
low-confidence predictions and the generation of well-calibrated wildfire
danger maps with accompanying uncertainty layers. Extending the forecast
horizon up to ten days, we observe that aleatoric uncertainty increases with
time, showing greater variability in environmental conditions, while epistemic
uncertainty remains stable. Finally, we show that although the two uncertainty
types may be redundant in low-uncertainty cases, they provide complementary
insights under more challenging conditions, underscoring the value of their
joint modeling for robust wildfire danger prediction. In summary, our approach
significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of wildfire danger
forecasting, advancing the development of trustworthy wildfire DL systems.

### [1000] [MARCOS: Deep Thinking by Markov Chain of Continuous Thoughts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25020)
*Jiayu Liu,Zhenya Huang,Anya Sims,Enhong Chen,Yee Whye Teh,Ning Miao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MARCOS, a reasoning framework for large language models using a hidden Markov chain of continuous thoughts, instead of traditional token-based chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current token-based chain-of-thought methods in large language models are slow, computationally expensive, and limit reasoning capabilities due to their discrete token spaces and entanglement with token generation.

Method: MARCOS models reasoning as a hidden Markov chain where internal continuous thoughts transition for each reasoning step. Explicit reasoning steps (token sequences) act as observable variables, with reasoning disentangled from token generation. A two-phase variational training scheme is introduced for this latent process.

Result: MARCOS demonstrates performance on par with or better than token-based chain-of-thought methods, outperforming by 4.7% on the GSM8K dataset and achieving up to 15.7x inference speed improvement on benchmarks.

Conclusion: MARCOS presents an innovative reasoning paradigm for large language models, enhancing inference speed and reasoning flexibility while enabling new applications in reinforcement learning and reasoning control.

Abstract: The current paradigm for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) involves
models "thinking out loud" via a sequence of tokens, known as chain-of-thought
(CoT). This approach, while effective, has several significant drawbacks.
Firstly, inference requires autoregressive generation of often thousands of CoT
tokens, which is slow and computationally expensive. Secondly, it constrains
reasoning to the discrete space of tokens, creating an information bottleneck
across reasoning steps. Thirdly, it fundamentally entangles reasoning with
token generation, forcing LLMs to "think while speaking," which causes
potentially short-sighted reasoning. In light of these limitations, we
re-imagine reasoning in LLMs and present a new paradigm: MARCOS. In our
approach, rather than autoregressively generating tokens, we model reasoning as
a hidden Markov chain of continuous, high-dimensional "thoughts". Each
reasoning step involves a transition of the internal thoughts, where explicit
reasoning steps (which may consist of hundreds of tokens) serve as observable
variables, which are windows to peek into the implicit thoughts. Since this
latent process is incompatible with the standard supervised learning, we
further propose a two-phase variational training scheme. Our experiments on
three benchmarks demonstrate that MARCOS outperforms existing continuous
reasoning methods and, for the first time, achieves performance comparable to
token-based CoT, even surpassing it by 4.7% on GSM8K with up to 15.7x speedup
in inference. Beyond this, MARCOS offers additional advantages, such as
step-level instead of token-level control over randomness, opening significant
opportunities for reinforcement learning and reasoning in LLMs.

### [1001] [Scaling with Collapse: Efficient and Predictable Training of LLM Families](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25087)
*Shane Bergsma,Bin Claire Zhang,Nolan Dey,Shaheer Muhammad,Gurpreet Gosal,Joel Hestness*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper shows that loss curves in LLM training collapse onto universal trajectories when using optimal hyperparameters under practical scaling recipes, and applies this concept to improve training diagnostics and hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding whether the loss curve collapse phenomenon holds under practical scaling recipes in LLM training and how it can be leveraged for efficient model training.

Method: The authors demonstrate that loss curve collapse occurs when optimal hyperparameters are set according to empirical scaling laws, linking this phenomenon to compute-efficient training of LLMs.

Result: They validate loss curve collapse across scales in practical settings, show its diagnostic utility for identifying training issues early, and propose its use for early stopping during hyperparameter tuning. They further use it to develop the competitive LLM family, Celerity.

Conclusion: Loss curve collapse is a key signature of efficient LLM training and has practical applications in diagnostics, optimization, and model development, optimizing compute practices and model performance.

Abstract: Effective LLM training relies on *consistency*, meaning that key quantities
-- such as final losses and optimal hyperparameters -- scale predictably across
model sizes. Qiu et al. (2025) recently showed that this consistency extends
beyond scalars: whole training loss curves can *collapse* onto a universal
trajectory after a simple normalization. What remains unclear is whether this
phenomenon holds for LLM families trained under *practical scaling recipes*,
where width, depth, learning rate, batch size, and weight decay are scaled
jointly. We show that it does: loss curves collapse across scales precisely
when optimization hyperparameters are set optimally for the given data budget,
in accordance with recent empirical scaling laws. Collapse thus emerges as a
signature of compute-efficient training. We demonstrate two applications at
scale: (1) deviation-from-collapse provides a sensitive, early diagnostic of
training pathologies, and (2) the predictability of collapsed curves enables
early stopping in large-scale hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we train a
competitive LLM family, *Celerity*, using these insights, highlighting collapse
as an effective tool for developing efficient LLMs.

*Sophia V. Kuhn,Rafael Bischof,Marius Weber,Antoine Binggeli,Michael A. Kraus,Walter Kaufmann,Fernando Pérez-Cruz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bayesian neural network surrogates to enable efficient and uncertainty-informed structural pre-assessments for aging infrastructure, significantly reducing resource demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aging infrastructure portfolios present a resource allocation issue: deciding which structures need intervention while balancing cost-effective analysis methods with accurate but time-intensive simulations.

Method: The authors propose Bayesian neural network surrogates trained on extensive databases of non-linear finite element analyses to predict structural code compliance factors, incorporating epistemic uncertainty for informed decision-making.

Result: The models demonstrated accurate and efficient estimation of high-fidelity structural analyses, enabling rapid identification of critical structures for further inspection.

Conclusion: By reducing the need for exhaustive manual analyses, the proposed approach significantly lowers costs and carbon emissions, optimizing resource allocation for large-scale infrastructure portfolios.

Abstract: Aging infrastructure portfolios pose a critical resource allocation
challenge: deciding which structures require intervention and which can safely
remain in service. Structural assessments must balance the trade-off between
cheaper, conservative analysis methods and accurate but costly simulations that
do not scale portfolio-wide. We propose Bayesian neural network (BNN)
surrogates for rapid structural pre-assessment of worldwide common bridge
types, such as reinforced concrete frame bridges. Trained on a large-scale
database of non-linear finite element analyses generated via a parametric
pipeline and developed based on the Swiss Federal Railway's bridge portfolio,
the models accurately and efficiently estimate high-fidelity structural
analysis results by predicting code compliance factors with calibrated
epistemic uncertainty. Our BNN surrogate enables fast, uncertainty-aware
triage: flagging likely critical structures and providing guidance where
refined analysis is pertinent. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in
a real-world case study of a railway underpass, showing its potential to
significantly reduce costs and emissions by avoiding unnecessary analyses and
physical interventions across entire infrastructure portfolios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ORPO-Distill improves cross-architecture LLM distillation by optimizing teacher-student reasoning traces, yielding better results across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations in conventional black-box knowledge distillation (KD) for large language models (LLMs), focusing on enhancing learning efficiency and quality across model architectures.

Method: The proposed method uses Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) to optimize teacher-student traces, along with a mixed-policy strategy to incorporate student outputs effectively, enabling diverse reasoning traces.

Result: ORPO-Distill consistently outperformed standard baselines (off- and on-policy methods) in experiments across five datasets and multiple student models.

Conclusion: The ORPO-Distill method effectively transfers knowledge between models, proving its superiority over traditional KD approaches in enhancing LLM distillation across varied architectures.

Abstract: We introduce ORPO-Distill, a general-purpose method for cross-architecture
LLM distillation that formulates the problem as a preference optimization task.
Unlike standard CoT distillation, the approach transfers knowledge through
diverse reasoning traces. It employs an Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization
objective that contrasts teacher and student traces for more effective
learning, and adopts a mixed-policy strategy for utilizing student-generated
outputs, outperforming both off- and on-policy alternatives. Experiments on
five datasets and multiple student models show consistent improvements over
conventional black-box KD baselines.

*Bingrui Li,Jiaxin Wen,Zhanpeng Zhou,Jun Zhu,Jianfei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of trajectory invariance to simplify and optimize hyperparameter tuning by reducing the search space dimensionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter tuning is becoming increasingly expensive in large-scale models, necessitating more efficient tuning principles.

Method: The authors study diverse hyperparameters and uncover trajectory invariance, where certain pre-training metrics overlap based on a combination of learning rate and weight decay. They propose a tuning rule that follows this pattern.

Result: A two-dimensional hyperparameter space is effectively reduced to one dimension using the concept of trajectory invariance, leading to simpler and more efficient hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: The paper establishes new principles for efficient hyperparameter tuning and challenges existing views while refining scaling laws.

Abstract: As hyperparameter tuning becomes increasingly costly at scale, efficient
tuning methods are essential. Yet principles for guiding hyperparameter tuning
remain limited. In this work, we seek to establish such principles by
considering a broad range of hyperparameters, including batch size, learning
rate, and weight decay. We identify a phenomenon we call trajectory invariance,
where pre-training loss curves, gradient noise, and gradient norm exhibit
invariance--closely overlapping--with respect to a quantity that combines
learning rate and weight decay. This phenomenon effectively reduces the
original two-dimensional hyperparameter space to one dimension, yielding an
efficient tuning rule: follow the salient direction revealed by trajectory
invariance. Furthermore, we refine previous scaling laws and challenge several
existing viewpoints. Overall, our work proposes new principles for efficient
tuning and inspires future research on scaling laws.

### [1005] [Advantage Weighted Matching: Aligning RL with Pretraining in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25050)
*Shuchen Xue,Chongjian Ge,Shilong Zhang,Yichen Li,Zhi-Ming Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM), a reinforcement learning method for diffusion models that unifies pretraining and RL objectives to achieve faster convergence and reduced variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and high variance in recent RL approaches for diffusion models, particularly Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO).

Method: The proposed method, AWM, employs a score/flow-matching loss identical to pretraining but reweights samples based on their advantage, reducing variance and aligning pretraining with RL objectives.

Result: AWM demonstrates significant improvements, achieving up to a 24x speedup compared to existing methods (like Flow-GRPO) on benchmarks such as GenEval, OCR, and PickScore without sacrificing generation quality.

Conclusion: AWM unifies pretraining and RL objectives, is consistent with policy-gradient theory, and provides substantial performance boosts in diffusion models, paving the way for more efficient reinforcement learning applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a central paradigm for advancing
Large Language Models (LLMs), where pre-training and RL post-training share the
same log-likelihood formulation. In contrast, recent RL approaches for
diffusion models, most notably Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO),
optimize an objective different from the pretraining objectives--score/flow
matching loss. In this work, we establish a novel theoretical analysis: DDPO is
an implicit form of score/flow matching with noisy targets, which increases
variance and slows convergence. Building on this analysis, we introduce
\textbf{Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM)}, a policy-gradient method for
diffusion. It uses the same score/flow-matching loss as pretraining to obtain a
lower-variance objective and reweights each sample by its advantage. In effect,
AWM raises the influence of high-reward samples and suppresses low-reward ones
while keeping the modeling objective identical to pretraining. This unifies
pretraining and RL conceptually and practically, is consistent with
policy-gradient theory, reduces variance, and yields faster convergence. This
simple yet effective design yields substantial benefits: on GenEval, OCR, and
PickScore benchmarks, AWM delivers up to a $24\times$ speedup over Flow-GRPO
(which builds on DDPO), when applied to Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX,
without compromising generation quality. Code is available at

*Yuxian Jiang,Yafu Li,Guanxu Chen,Dongrui Liu,Yu Cheng,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses entropy collapse and premature convergence in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for large reasoning models (LRMs) by introducing SIREN, a selective entropy regularization method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem of entropy collapse and premature convergence in RLVR for LRMs, which naive entropy regularization fails to mitigate due to vast action space and long trajectories.

Method: The paper introduces SIREN, which uses a two-step entropy masking mechanism (top-p mask and peak-entropy mask) and a self-anchored regularization to confine exploration and stabilize training.

Result: SIREN demonstrates superior performance across five mathematical benchmarks and shows a +6.6 maj@k improvement on AIME24/25 with Qwen2.5-Math-7B. It promotes response diversity and maintains appropriate entropy levels.

Conclusion: The proposed SIREN method effectively mitigates premature convergence in RLVR for LRMs while preserving validation performance throughout training.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown great promise
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large reasoning models (LRMs). However,
it suffers from a critical issue: entropy collapse and premature convergence.
Naive entropy regularization, a common approach for encouraging exploration in
the traditional RL literature, fails to address this problem in the context of
LRM. Our analysis reveals that this failure stems from the vast action space
and long trajectories in LRMs, which easily trigger a global entropy explosion
as the model indiscriminately explores all possible actions and states. To
address this, we propose SIREN (SelectIve entRopy rEgularizatioN), a method
that confines exploration to a meaningful subset of actions and states. SIREN
achieves this through a two-step entropy masking mechanism, consisting of a
top-p mask and a peak-entropy mask. In addition, regularization is transformed
into a self-anchored form to stabilize training. Across five mathematical
benchmarks, SIREN attains superior average performance over previous
entropy-related RLVR approaches, exemplified by a +6.6 maj@k improvement on
AIME24/25 with Qwen2.5-Math-7B. Further analysis confirms that SIREN promotes
greater response diversity and maintains entropy at an appropriate level, which
helps to preserve the validation pass@k throughout training. This effectively
mitigates the premature convergence problem common in RLVR for LRM.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection in regression tasks using score-based diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-driven models in critical fields like weather forecasting and fluid dynamics struggle to handle OOD data. This paper aims to address the challenge of detecting such failures in regression tasks.

Method: The method involves using score-based diffusion models to estimate joint likelihoods, integrating both inputs and regression model predictions to generate task-aware reliability scores.

Result: Experiments across various scientific datasets show that the estimated likelihoods correlate strongly with prediction errors, enhancing OOD detection capabilities.

Conclusion: The study offers a foundational step towards creating trustworthy AI tools for scientific predictions. The proposed framework introduces a practical mechanism for reliability assessment, with publicly available code for broader use.

Abstract: Data-driven models are increasingly adopted in critical scientific fields
like weather forecasting and fluid dynamics. These methods can fail on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data, but detecting such failures in regression tasks
is an open challenge. We propose a new OOD detection method based on estimating
joint likelihoods using a score-based diffusion model. This approach considers
not just the input but also the regression model's prediction, providing a
task-aware reliability score. Across numerous scientific datasets, including
PDE datasets, satellite imagery and brain tumor segmentation, we show that this
likelihood strongly correlates with prediction error. Our work provides a
foundational step towards building a verifiable 'certificate of trust', thereby
offering a practical tool for assessing the trustworthiness of AI-based
scientific predictions. Our code is publicly available at

*Albert Vong,Steven Henke,Oliver Hoidn,Hanna Ruth,Junjing Deng,Alexander Hexemer,Apurva Mehta,Arianna Gleason,Levi Hancock,Nicholas Schwarz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a physics-informed, deep learning-based method for efficient and robust X-ray ptychography reconstruction across diverse experimental conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional reconstruction methods for X-ray ptychography are too slow for next-generation light sources, demanding quicker and more adaptable solutions.

Method: The paper proposes an unsupervised, probe-centric deep neural network training workflow using experimentally-measured probes combined with synthetic objects for robust reconstruction models.

Result: The workflow achieved reconstruction fidelity comparable to experimental data-trained models and demonstrated robustness across multiple beamlines with dynamic conditions.

Conclusion: The approach facilitates real-time feedback for fast and adaptable experiment steering, overcoming limitations of existing deep learning methods in X-ray ptychography.

Abstract: X-ray ptychography is a data-intensive imaging technique expected to become
ubiquitous at next-generation light sources delivering many-fold increases in
coherent flux. The need for real-time feedback under accelerated acquisition
rates motivates surrogate reconstruction models like deep neural networks,
which offer orders-of-magnitude speedup over conventional methods. However,
existing deep learning approaches lack robustness across diverse experimental
conditions. We propose an unsupervised training workflow emphasizing probe
learning by combining experimentally-measured probes with synthetic,
procedurally generated objects. This probe-centric approach enables a single
physics-informed neural network to reconstruct unseen experiments across
multiple beamlines; among the first demonstrations of multi-probe
generalization. We find probe learning is equally important as in-distribution
learning; models trained using this synthetic workflow achieve reconstruction
fidelity comparable to those trained exclusively on experimental data, even
when changing the type of synthetic training object. The proposed approach
enables training of experiment-steering models that provide real-time feedback
under dynamic experimental conditions.

*Haoming Wen,Yushi Bai,Juanzi Li,Jie Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIRI, a reinforcement learning approach enhancing efficiency and accuracy in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) via alternating compression and expansion cycles during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LRMs encounter repetitive thinking patterns, leading to inefficiencies. Previous efforts to mitigate this issue have sacrificed performance, necessitating a novel approach balancing efficiency and effectiveness.

Method: SIRI follows a two-phase training cycle: compression reduces rollout length to enhance decision precision, while expansion increases length to enable exploration. This iterative adjustment dynamically improves performance while minimizing token usage.

Result: The SIRI approach applied to models like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B significantly boosts reasoning performance (43.2% on AIME24) while using fewer tokens (46.9% reduction), achieving superior accuracy compared to other methods.

Conclusion: SIRI demonstrates the potential of oscillating output truncation lengths during training to effectively balance reasoning depth and efficiency, reaching an optimal trade-off. Its publicly available models offer practical value for further research.

Abstract: We introduce SIRI, Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved
Compression, a simple yet effective RL approach for Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) that enables more efficient and accurate reasoning. Existing studies
have observed repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs, and attempts to reduce them
often come at the cost of performance. In this paper, we show that this
trade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates
between compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically
adjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase
cuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable
decisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens
and increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length
limit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon
settings. Remarkably, we find that after each compression-expansion cycle, the
model's performance improves even as its output length decreases, steadily
pushing it closer to the Pareto frontier in the performance-efficiency
trade-off. Training on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, SIRI-low improves
performance on AIME24 by 43.2% while reducing token usage by 46.9% after three
iterations, and SIRI-high achieves the highest accuracy compared to all other
methods (Figure 1). Our findings shed light on the potential of periodically
oscillating the LRM's output truncation length during training to dynamically
balance exploration and efficiency in reasoning, converging towards an optimal
"sweet spot" between the two. Our models are publicly available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes BALF, a neural network compression framework that simplifies the process by eliminating the need for fine-tuning and offers flexible control on compression targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural network compression often demands extensive fine-tuning and computational resources, making it challenging to implement on standard hardware.

Method: They developed the BALF framework, incorporating activation-aware factorization and a scalable rank allocation system to compress models without fine-tuning.

Result: BALF successfully compresses models like ResNet-20, ResNeXt-101, and vision transformers, demonstrating significant reduction in computational overhead while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: The BALF framework is effective at compressing neural networks without the need for fine-tuning, enabling resource-efficient optimization with minimal sacrifice in accuracy.

Abstract: Neural network compression techniques typically require expensive fine-tuning
or search procedures, rendering them impractical on commodity hardware.
Inspired by recent LLM compression research, we present a general
activation-aware factorization framework that can be applied to a broad range
of layers. Moreover, we introduce a scalable budgeted rank allocator that
allows flexible control over compression targets (e.g., retaining 50% of
parameters) with no overhead. Together, these components form BALF, an
efficient pipeline for compressing models without fine-tuning. We demonstrate
its effectiveness across multiple scales and architectures, from ResNet-20 on
CIFAR-10 to ResNeXt-101 and vision transformers on ImageNet, and show that it
achieves excellent results in the fine-tuning-free regime. For instance, BALF
reduces FLOPs on ResNeXt-101 by 45% with only a 1-percentage-point top-1
accuracy drop.

*Jinhao Liang,Yixuan Sun,Anirban Samaddar,Sandeep Madireddy,Ferdinando Fioretto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Chance-constrained Flow Matching (CCFM), a training-free method combining stochastic optimization and generative sampling to enforce hard constraints without distorting data distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models often struggle with hard constraints derived from physical laws or task specifications, and conventional projection methods can distort data distributions or complicate sampling processes.

Method: The paper proposes CCFM, which integrates stochastic optimization directly into the sampling process, maintaining both constraint feasibility and distribution fidelity without the need for multi-step projections.

Result: CCFM demonstrated superior performance in constrained generative modeling tasks like physical systems governed by partial differential equations and molecular docking problems, achieving better feasibility and fidelity than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CCFM provides a theoretically sound and empirically validated approach for constraint enforcement in generative modeling, addressing key challenges and improving performance while simplifying the sampling process.

Abstract: Generative models excel at synthesizing high-fidelity samples from complex
data distributions, but they often violate hard constraints arising from
physical laws or task specifications. A common remedy is to project
intermediate samples onto the feasible set; however, repeated projection can
distort the learned distribution and induce a mismatch with the data manifold.
Thus, recent multi-stage procedures attempt to defer projection to clean
samples during sampling, but they increase algorithmic complexity and
accumulate errors across steps. This paper addresses these challenges by
proposing a novel training-free method, Chance-constrained Flow Matching
(CCFM), that integrates stochastic optimization into the sampling process,
enabling effective enforcement of hard constraints while maintaining
high-fidelity sample generation. Importantly, CCFM guarantees feasibility in
the same manner as conventional repeated projection, yet, despite operating
directly on noisy intermediate samples, it is theoretically equivalent to
projecting onto the feasible set defined by clean samples. This yields a
sampler that mitigates distributional distortion. Empirical experiments show
that CCFM outperforms current state-of-the-art constrained generative models in
modeling complex physical systems governed by partial differential equations
and molecular docking problems, delivering higher feasibility and fidelity.

TL;DR: The paper explores ways to improve voltage prediction in power grids using physics-informed machine learning techniques, specifically Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voltage prediction is crucial for power system stability but challenging due to poor generalization of machine learning models trained on limited or incomplete data.

Method: The study investigates three physics-informed approaches: power-flow-constrained loss functions, complex-valued neural networks, and residual-based task reformulation. Controlled experiments are conducted using the ENGAGE dataset.

Result: The experiments demonstrate the effects of various inductive biases on both predictive performance and out-of-distribution generalization, yielding valuable insights.

Conclusion: Physics-informed inductive biases improve the reliability and efficiency of machine learning models for voltage prediction in modern distribution networks.

Abstract: Voltage prediction in distribution grids is a critical yet difficult task for
maintaining power system stability. Machine learning approaches, particularly
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer significant speedups but suffer from poor
generalization when trained on limited or incomplete data. In this work, we
systematically investigate the role of inductive biases in improving a model's
ability to reliably learn power flow. Specifically, we evaluate three
physics-informed strategies: (i) power-flow-constrained loss functions, (ii)
complex-valued neural networks, and (iii) residual-based task reformulation.
Using the ENGAGE dataset, which spans multiple low- and medium-voltage grid
configurations, we conduct controlled experiments to isolate the effect of each
inductive bias and assess both standard predictive performance and
out-of-distribution generalization. Our study provides practical insights into
which model assumptions most effectively guide learning for reliable and
efficient voltage prediction in modern distribution networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TR2-D2, a framework that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for optimizing reward-guided discrete diffusion trajectories, ensuring improved fine-tuning of diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning approaches in diffusion fine-tuning often reinforce sub-optimal trajectories due to reliance on the current model's rollouts.

Method: TR2-D2 employs MCTS to generate trajectory-aware replay buffers, allowing for improved fine-tuning of pre-trained diffusion models based on stochastic optimal control objectives.

Result: The TR2-D2 framework demonstrates successful single- and multi-objective fine-tuning in biological sequence generation tasks, showcasing its potential in reliably guiding discrete diffusion processes.

Conclusion: TR2-D2 effectively addresses the limitations of reinforcement learning-based diffusion fine-tuning by leveraging tree search methods for trajectory-aware optimization, making it valuable in discrete sequence generation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with stochastic optimal control offers a promising
framework for diffusion fine-tuning, where a pre-trained diffusion model is
optimized to generate paths that lead to a reward-tilted distribution. While
these approaches enable optimization without access to explicit samples from
the optimal distribution, they require training on rollouts under the current
fine-tuned model, making them susceptible to reinforcing sub-optimal
trajectories that yield poor rewards. To overcome this challenge, we introduce
TRee Search Guided TRajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion
(TR2-D2), a novel framework that optimizes reward-guided discrete diffusion
trajectories with tree search to construct replay buffers for trajectory-aware
fine-tuning. These buffers are generated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
and subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained discrete diffusion model under
a stochastic optimal control objective. We validate our framework on single-
and multi-objective fine-tuning of biological sequence diffusion models,
highlighting the overall effectiveness of TR2-D2 for reliable reward-guided
fine-tuning in discrete sequence generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving sample efficiency in deep reinforcement learning by analyzing the critic network's optimization landscape, introducing well-motivated design principles, and proposing the sample-efficient XQC algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance sample efficiency in deep reinforcement learning by addressing limitations related to optimization landscape and training stability, rather than relying solely on empirical performance improvements.

Method: The authors analyze the Hessian eigenspectrum and condition number for different architectural design decisions, and introduce a combination of batch normalization, weight normalization, and distributional cross-entropy loss.

Result: The proposed combination significantly reduces the condition number, stabilizes gradient norms, and improves training dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art sample efficiency in 70 continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: Optimization-aware design principles lead to improved sample efficiency without increasing model complexity, demonstrated by the XQC algorithm's superior performance with fewer parameters.

Abstract: Sample efficiency is a central property of effective deep reinforcement
learning algorithms. Recent work has improved this through added complexity,
such as larger models, exotic network architectures, and more complex
algorithms, which are typically motivated purely by empirical performance. We
take a more principled approach by focusing on the optimization landscape of
the critic network. Using the eigenspectrum and condition number of the
critic's Hessian, we systematically investigate the impact of common
architectural design decisions on training dynamics. Our analysis reveals that
a novel combination of batch normalization (BN), weight normalization (WN), and
a distributional cross-entropy (CE) loss produces condition numbers orders of
magnitude smaller than baselines. This combination also naturally bounds
gradient norms, a property critical for maintaining a stable effective learning
rate under non-stationary targets and bootstrapping. Based on these insights,
we introduce XQC: a well-motivated, sample-efficient deep actor-critic
algorithm built upon soft actor-critic that embodies these optimization-aware
principles. We achieve state-of-the-art sample efficiency across 55
proprioception and 15 vision-based continuous control tasks, all while using
significantly fewer parameters than competing methods.

*Peiyu Liu,Jianhao Ding,Zhaofei Yu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a normalization-free training framework for spiking neural networks (SNNs), leveraging biologically-inspired E-I circuits and techniques to enable stable training while maintaining biological realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between performance and biological realism in training deep SNNs, which are hindered by traditional reliance on explicit normalization schemes like batch normalization.

Method: The authors propose replacing feedforward SNN layers with excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) neural circuits inspired by cortical dynamics and introduce two techniques: E-I Init for parameter initialization ensuring neuron balance, and E-I Prop for decoupling forward/backward propagation via gradient flow regulation.

Result: The proposed framework achieves stable training of biologically constrained deep SNNs while maintaining competitive performance across datasets and architectures without explicit normalization.

Conclusion: This work bridges a gap in training SNNs by reconciling biological plausibility with computational efficiency and establishes a platform to further investigate cortical computation's lateral inhibition mechanisms.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered significant attention as a
central paradigm in neuromorphic computing, owing to their energy efficiency
and biological plausibility. However, training deep SNNs has critically
depended on explicit normalization schemes, such as batch normalization,
leading to a trade-off between performance and biological realism. To resolve
this conflict, we propose a normalization-free learning framework that
incorporates lateral inhibition inspired by cortical circuits. Our framework
replaces the traditional feedforward SNN layer with a circuit of distinct
excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons that complies with Dale's law. The
circuit dynamically regulates neuronal activity through subtractive and
divisive inhibition, which respectively control the activity and the gain of
excitatory neurons. To enable and stabilize end-to-end training of the
biologically constrained SNN, we propose two key techniques: E-I Init and E-I
Prop. E-I Init is a dynamic parameter initialization scheme that balances
excitatory and inhibitory inputs while performing gain control. E-I Prop
decouples the backpropagation of the E-I circuits from the forward propagation
and regulates gradient flow. Experiments across several datasets and network
architectures demonstrate that our framework enables stable training of deep
SNNs with biological realism and achieves competitive performance without
resorting to explicit normalizations. Therefore, our work not only provides a
solution to training deep SNNs but also serves a computational platform for
further exploring the functions of lateral inhibition in large-scale cortical

TL;DR: This paper introduces Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for radar-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR), combining spatial and temporal processing for efficient aircraft marshalling signal classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational demands of radar-based HAR on edge devices, providing a more efficient alternative to camera methods while preserving privacy and robustness.

Method: A hybrid architecture is developed using convolutional modules for spatial features and Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons for temporal dynamics to model radar-based HAR.

Result: The approach reduces trainable parameters by 88% with less than 1% accuracy loss and successfully applies to other datasets, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: SNNs are proven to be an efficient and competitive solution for radar-based HAR, balancing the trade-offs in accuracy, latency, memory, and energy usage.

Abstract: Radar-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) offers privacy and robustness
over camera-based methods, yet remains computationally demanding for edge
deployment. We present the first use of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for
radar-based HAR on aircraft marshalling signal classification. Our novel hybrid
architecture combines convolutional modules for spatial feature extraction with
Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons for temporal processing, inherently
capturing gesture dynamics. The model reduces trainable parameters by 88\% with
under 1\% accuracy loss compared to baselines, and generalizes well to the Soli
gesture dataset. Through systematic comparisons with Artificial Neural
Networks, we demonstrate the trade-offs of spiking computation in terms of
accuracy, latency, memory, and energy, establishing SNNs as an efficient and
competitive solution for radar-based HAR.

*Muhammad Bilal*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS), a spiking neural network model optimized for network tasks like congestion management and anomaly detection. It improves performance in such tasks compared to classical units and traditional baselines, particularly in early-warning and detection latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical spiking neural network models like Hodgkin-Huxley and Izhikevich are not well-suited for time-critical networking tasks at the edge (e.g., anomaly detection or congestion management).

Method: The authors propose Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS), a novel two-variable neural unit designed to handle edge-computation tasks by encoding queue occupancy and recovery resource. NOS supports training via two differentiable reset schemes and employs an operational rule and stability tests based on network and graph topology.

Result: NOS demonstrates superior performance to baseline methods in detecting congestion onsets with fewer false positives, better early-warning F1 scores, and reduced detection latency across various network topologies. Calibration methods improve its precision under bursty inputs and enable label-free forecasting.

Conclusion: Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS) is a robust, resource-efficient spiking neural network designed for network edge tasks. It outperforms traditional units and modern neural models in both open- and closed-loop scenarios, offering timely and precise congestion detection and management.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks offer event-driven computation suited to
time-critical networking tasks such as anomaly detection, local routing
control, and congestion management at the edge. Classical units, including
Hodgkin-Huxley, Izhikevich, and the Random Neural Network, map poorly to these
needs. We introduce Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS), a compact two-variable
unit whose state encodes normalised queue occupancy and a recovery resource.
The model uses a saturating nonlinearity to enforce finite buffers, a
service-rate leak, and graph-local inputs with delays and optional per link
gates. It supports two differentiable reset schemes for training and
deployment. We give conditions for equilibrium existence and uniqueness, local
stability tests from the Jacobian trace and determinant, and a network
threshold that scales with the Perron eigenvalue of the coupling matrix. The
analysis yields an operational rule g* ~ k* rho(W) linking damping and offered
load, shows how saturation enlarges the stable region, and explains finite-size
smoothing of synchrony onsets. Stochastic arrivals follow a Poisson shot-noise
model aligned with telemetry smoothing. Against queueing baselines, NOS matches
M/M/1 mean by calibration while truncating deep tails under bursty input. In
closed loop it gives, low-jitte with short settling. In zero-shot, label-free
forecasting NOS is calibrated per node from arrival statistics. Its NOS
dynamics yield high AUROC/AUPRC, enabling timely detection of congestion onsets
with few false positives. Under a train-calibrated residual protocol across
chain, star, and scale-free topologies, NOS improves early-warning F1 and
detection latency over MLP, RNN, GRU, and tGNN. We provide guidance for
data-driven initialisation, surrogate-gradient training with a homotopy on
reset sharpness, and explicit stability checks with topology-aware bounds for
resource constrained deployments.

*Nhan T. Luu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper finds that Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), without explicit regularization, can achieve state-of-the-art adversarial defense performance through natural gradient sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and improving the adversarial robustness of SNNs, particularly in vision-related tasks, is an underexplored area.

Method: The study analyzes the behavior of SNNs under specific architectural configurations to uncover their inherent gradient sparsity and its effect on adversarial robustness.

Result: SNNs with natural gradient sparsity demonstrate superior adversarial defense capabilities without requiring external regularization.

Conclusion: Adversarial robustness emerges intrinsically in SNNs via gradient sparsity, but there is a trade-off with generalization capability, where sparse gradients enhance robustness and dense gradients enhance generalization.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted growing interest in both
computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, primarily due to their
inherent energy efficiency and compact memory footprint. However, achieving
adversarial robustness in SNNs, particularly for vision-related tasks, remains
a nascent and underexplored challenge. Recent studies have proposed leveraging
sparse gradients as a form of regularization to enhance robustness against
adversarial perturbations. In this work, we present a surprising finding: under
specific architectural configurations, SNNs exhibit natural gradient sparsity
and can achieve state-of-the-art adversarial defense performance without the
need for any explicit regularization. Further analysis reveals a trade-off
between robustness and generalization: while sparse gradients contribute to
improved adversarial resilience, they can impair the model's ability to
generalize; conversely, denser gradients support better generalization but
increase vulnerability to attacks.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Confidence-adaptive and Re-calibration Batch Normalization (CaRe-BN) to improve Spiking Neural Networks' (SNNs) optimization in online Reinforcement Learning, overcoming issues with Batch Normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs provide energy-efficient solutions but face challenges due to reliance on Batch Normalization in RL, which impacts convergence and policy optimization.

Method: CaRe-BN incorporates confidence-guided adaptive updates and a re-calibration mechanism to improve BN statistics without disrupting RL training.

Result: CaRe-BN enhances SNN optimization, improves performance by up to 22.6%, and enables SNNs to outperform ANNs by 5.9% in benchmarks.

Conclusion: CaRe-BN establishes a promising approach for stabilizing SNN training in RL, unlocking high-performing, energy-efficient neuromorphic agents.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer low-latency and energy-efficient
decision-making on neuromorphic hardware by mimicking the event-driven dynamics
of biological neurons. However, due to the discrete and non-differentiable
nature of spikes, directly trained SNNs rely heavily on Batch Normalization
(BN) to stabilize gradient updates. In online Reinforcement Learning (RL),
imprecise BN statistics hinder exploitation, resulting in slower convergence
and suboptimal policies. This challenge limits the adoption of SNNs for
energy-efficient control on resource-constrained devices. To overcome this, we
propose Confidence-adaptive and Re-calibration Batch Normalization (CaRe-BN),
which introduces (\emph{i}) a confidence-guided adaptive update strategy for BN
statistics and (\emph{ii}) a re-calibration mechanism to align distributions.
By providing more accurate normalization, CaRe-BN stabilizes SNN optimization
without disrupting the RL training process. Importantly, CaRe-BN does not alter
inference, thus preserving the energy efficiency of SNNs in deployment.
Extensive experiments on continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that CaRe-BN
improves SNN performance by up to $22.6\%$ across different spiking neuron
models and RL algorithms. Remarkably, SNNs equipped with CaRe-BN even surpass
their ANN counterparts by $5.9\%$. These results highlight a new direction for
BN techniques tailored to RL, paving the way for neuromorphic agents that are
both efficient and high-performing.

*Nhan T. Luu,Duong T. Luu,Pham Ngoc Nam,Truong Cong Thang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid ANN-SNN framework using surrogate gradients for bit-plane-based spike encoding, achieving competitive accuracy and a novel approach to integrate ANN-SNN layers for end-to-end differentiable learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to combine the energy efficiency of SNNs with the high accuracy and optimization capabilities of ANNs in a seamless, layer-wise manner while addressing the issue of non-differentiability in spike encoding.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid ANN-SNN architecture by integrating layer-wise SNN blocks within ANN pipelines, leveraging surrogate gradients for bit-plane-based spike encoding to enable end-to-end differentiability.

Result: Their approach achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art pure ANN and SNN models, while retaining the efficiency and potential of temporal representations inherent to spiking computation.

Conclusion: The paper not only demonstrates the feasibility of end-to-end training for hybrid ANN-SNN models but also introduces a new class of architectures that offer promising directions for future research.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant traction in both
computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence for their potential in
energy-efficient computing. In contrast, artificial neural networks (ANNs)
excel at gradient-based optimization and high accuracy. This contrast has
consequently led to a growing subfield of hybrid ANN-SNN research. However,
existing hybrid approaches often rely on either a strict separation between ANN
and SNN components or employ SNN-only encoders followed by ANN classifiers due
to the constraints of non-differentiability of spike encoding functions,
causing prior hybrid architectures to lack deep layer-wise cooperation during
backpropagation. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid ANN-SNN
framework that integrates layer-wise encode-decode SNN blocks within
conventional ANN pipelines. Central to our method is the use of surrogate
gradients for a bit-plane-based spike encoding function, enabling end-to-end
differentiable training across ANN and SNN layers. This design achieves
competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art pure ANN and SNN models while
retaining the potential efficiency and temporal representation benefits of
spiking computation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
implementation of a surrogate gradient for bit plane coding specifically and
spike encoder interface in general to be utilized in the context of hybrid
ANN-SNN, successfully leading to a new class of hybrid models that pave new
directions for future research.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper advocates for integrating biological inspiration into AI to bridge disparities and enhance capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the increasing computational demand from large language models and leveraging biological mechanisms for novel AI developments.

Method: Analyzing disparities between artificial and natural intelligence, comparing elements from both systems, and identifying areas yet to be captured by AI.

Result: Highlighted gaps where AI fails to emulate natural intelligence and identified opportunities for integrating NI into modern AI systems.

Conclusion: Further biological inspiration is crucial for diversifying AI capabilities, ensuring adaptability in real-world environments and niche applications.

Abstract: The introduction of large language models has significantly expanded global
demand for computing; addressing this growing demand requires novel approaches
that introduce new capabilities while addressing extant needs. Although
inspiration from biological systems served as the foundation on which modern
artificial intelligence (AI) was developed, many modern advances have been made
without clear parallels to biological computing. As a result, the ability of
techniques inspired by "natural intelligence" (NI) to inflect modern AI systems
may be questioned. However, by analyzing remaining disparities between AI and
NI, we argue that further biological inspiration is indeed necessary to
diversify the capabilities of artificial systems and enable them to succeed in
real-world environments and adapt to niche applications. To elucidate which NI
mechanisms can contribute toward this goal, we review and compare elements of
biological and artificial computing systems, emphasizing areas of NI that have
not yet been effectively captured by AI. We then suggest areas of opportunity
for NI-inspired mechanisms that can inflect AI hardware and software.

*Yiting Dong,Jianhao Ding,Zijie Xu,Tong Bu,Zhaofei Yu,Tiejun Huang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces PredNext, a module enhancing unsupervised representation learning in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for large-scale temporal video data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised SNNs often lack the depth and temporal feature consistency required for modeling long-range dependencies in video data.

Method: PredNext employs cross-view future Step Prediction and Clip Prediction to explicitly model temporal relationships, and it integrates seamlessly with self-supervised objectives.

Result: PredNext significantly improves performance on benchmarks such as UCF101, HMDB51, and MiniKinetics, achieving results comparable to supervised ImageNet pretraining.

Conclusion: PredNext enhances temporal feature consistency and network generalization, offering a strong foundation for unsupervised deep SNNs in large-scale video tasks.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their temporal processing capabilities
and biologically plausible dynamics, offer a natural platform for unsupervised
representation learning. However, current unsupervised SNNs predominantly
employ shallow architectures or localized plasticity rules, limiting their
ability to model long-range temporal dependencies and maintain temporal feature
consistency. This results in semantically unstable representations, thereby
impeding the development of deep unsupervised SNNs for large-scale temporal
video data. We propose PredNext, which explicitly models temporal relationships
through cross-view future Step Prediction and Clip Prediction. This
plug-and-play module seamlessly integrates with diverse self-supervised
objectives. We firstly establish standard benchmarks for SNN self-supervised
learning on UCF101, HMDB51, and MiniKinetics, which are substantially larger
than conventional DVS datasets. PredNext delivers significant performance
improvements across different tasks and self-supervised methods. PredNext
achieves performance comparable to ImageNet-pretrained supervised weights
through unsupervised training solely on UCF101. Additional experiments
demonstrate that PredNext, distinct from forced consistency constraints,
substantially improves temporal feature consistency while enhancing network
generalization capabilities. This work provides a effective foundation for
unsupervised deep SNNs on large-scale temporal video data.

*Alexandre Queant,Ulysse Rançon,Benoit R Cottereau,Timothée Masquelier*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'DelRec,' a method to train axonal or synaptic delays in recurrent spiking layers of spiking neural networks (SNNs), achieving state-of-the-art performance on temporal datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited expressivity of SNNs by leveraging trainable synaptic delays which have been theoretically identified as beneficial but lack practical, efficient training methods.

Method: The authors propose 'DelRec,' which employs surrogate gradient learning paired with a differentiable interpolation technique to optimize non-integer synaptic delays in recurrent spiking layers, compatible with various spiking neuron models.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art results on two temporal datasets (Spiking Speech Command and Permuted Sequential MNIST) and matches state-of-the-art performance on the Spiking Heidelberg Digit dataset using standard spiking neuron models.

Conclusion: Recurrent synaptic delays improve SNNs' temporal processing capabilities significantly, and the 'DelRec' method effectively optimizes such delays, paving the way for better energy efficiency and performance in neuromorphic hardware.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a bio-inspired alternative to conventional
real-valued deep learning models, with the potential for substantially higher
energy efficiency. Interest in SNNs has recently exploded due to a major
breakthrough: surrogate gradient learning (SGL), which allows training SNNs
with backpropagation, strongly outperforming other approaches. In SNNs, each
synapse is characterized not only by a weight but also by a transmission delay.
While theoretical works have long suggested that trainable delays significantly
enhance expressivity, practical methods for learning them have only recently
emerged. Here, we introduce ''DelRec'', the first SGL-based method to train
axonal or synaptic delays in recurrent spiking layers, compatible with any
spiking neuron model. DelRec leverages a differentiable interpolation technique
to handle non-integer delays with well-defined gradients at training time. We
show that trainable recurrent delays outperform feedforward ones, leading to
new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on two challenging temporal datasets (Spiking
Speech Command, an audio dataset, and Permuted Sequential MNIST, a vision one),
and match the SOTA on the now saturated Spiking Heidelberg Digit dataset using
only vanilla Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire neurons with stateless (instantaneous)
synapses. Our results demonstrate that recurrent delays are critical for
temporal processing in SNNs and can be effectively optimized with DelRec,
paving the way for efficient deployment on neuromorphic hardware with
programmable delays. Our code is available at :

TL;DR: The QMoE model compresses massive Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, addressing memory and operational constraints, especially in limited environments like mobile devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of running massive MoE models in memory and latency-constrained environments like mobile devices, and to eliminate dependency on server-based processing.

Method: QMoE leverages high sparsity in MoE models for compression, targeting both memory-efficient execution and improvements in environments with restricted resources.

Result: The model demonstrates feasibility for compressing large MoE models, making them operable within hardware-constrained environments while tackling latency issues.

Conclusion: QMoE offers a promising technique for adapting MoE models in memory-constrained environments, mitigating latency and enabling edge device deployments.

Abstract: The QMoE model provides a practical approach for compression of massive
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. QMoE offers a solution geared towards memory
limitations that often reach terabyte scales, and it has the advantage of
working with high sparsity models which implicitly lend themselves to
compression techniques. QMoE also has the advantage of only taking MoE models
into account and does not evaluate its use with non mixture of expert systems.
Although this prior attempt focuses on the limitations of large servers with
the latest NVIDIA hardware which in the case of the H100 and V100 which have 80
GB of HBM (High Bandwidth Memory), what is not being considered is a
significantly more constrained environment, such as in the case of mobile
devices which may have in the case of the iPhone anywhere from 4 to 8 GB of
unified memory which also needs to be shared with the operating system and
additional processes. Although edge devices such as phones and laptops are
becoming increasingly more computationally powerful, they are still not close
to the level of advanced server machines such as NVIDIA. An additional
constraint that we must consider is that of latency. The communication time of
sending a request to an LLM server and then getting it back is an additional
waiting time that can be removed. We may also want to use LLM technology in
environments where there is no reliable network connection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing performance tuners fail to address optimization challenges in environments with interference, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: The authors designed DarwinGame, which uses a tournament-based approach to compare application executions under different tunable parameter configurations while accounting for interference.

Result: DarwinGame reduces execution time by over 27% and ensures performance variability of less than 0.5% in noisy environments.

Conclusion: DarwinGame represents a novel solution for tuning application performance in interference-prone cloud environments, outperforming existing tuners in efficiency and stability.

Abstract: This work introduces a new subarea of performance tuning -- performance
tuning in a shared interference-prone computing environment. We demonstrate
that existing tuners are significantly suboptimal by design because of their
inability to account for interference during tuning. Our solution, DarwinGame,
employs a tournament-based design to systematically compare application
executions with different tunable parameter configurations, enabling it to
identify the relative performance of different tunable parameter configurations
in a noisy environment. Compared to existing solutions, DarwinGame achieves
more than 27% reduction in execution time, with less than 0.5% performance
variability. DarwinGame is the first performance tuner that will help
developers tune their applications in shared, interference-prone, cloud
environments.

*David M Kahn,Jan Hoffmann,Thomas Reps,Jessie Grosen*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for deriving program execution cost bounds using types, addressing inefficiencies in the current state-of-the-art algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current algorithms for inferring cost-free types in AARA are computationally expensive and limited in applicability to polynomial cost bounds.

Method: The authors propose representing cost-free types with a linear map, which allows algebraic reasoning via matrix inequalities, solving them with linear-programming tools.

Result: The experimental evaluation demonstrates the new inference method is exponentially more efficient than existing approaches when applicable.

Conclusion: This work significantly enhances the efficiency and scope of cost-bound inference in AARA, including for non-polynomial bounds.

Abstract: The Automatic Amortized Resource Analysis (AARA) derives program-execution
cost bounds using types. To do so, AARA often makes use of cost-free types,
which are critical for the composition of types and cost bounds. However,
inferring cost-free types using the current state-of-the-art algorithm is
expensive due to recursive dependence on additional cost-free types.
Furthermore, that algorithm uses a heuristic only applicable to polynomial cost
bounds, and not, e.g., exponential bounds. This paper presents a new approach
to these problems by representing the cost-free types of a function in a new
way: with a linear map, which can stand for infinitely many cost-free types.
Such maps enable an algebraic flavor of reasoning about cost bounds (including
non-polynomial bounds) via matrix inequalities. These inequalities can be
solved with off-the-shelf linear-programming tools for many programs, so that
types can always be efficiently checked and often be efficiently inferred. An
experimental evaluation with a prototype implementation shows that-when it is
applicable-the inference of linear maps is exponentially more efficient than
the state-of-the-art algorithm.

Motivation: Evaluate the challenges of compositional specification generation in LLMs, especially for multi-function dependencies.

Method: Introduce DafnyCOMP, a 300-program benchmark focused on multi-function programs with data dependencies; test state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: LLMs show strong performance in single-function verification but fail significantly in compositional reasoning tasks across functions.

Conclusion: DafnyCOMP can guide progress toward reliable, verifiable, and compositional code generation in LLMs by exposing systematic failures.

Abstract: We introduce DafnyCOMP, a benchmark for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) on compositional specification generation in Dafny. Unlike prior
benchmarks that focus on single-function tasks, DafnyCOMP targets programs
composed of multiple interacting functions with data dependencies, requiring
reasoning across component boundaries. The benchmark consists of 300
automatically synthesized multi-function programs. We evaluate several
state-of-the-art LLM families and find that, while they perform well on
single-function verification, their performance drops sharply on compositional
tasks. Analysis reveals systematic failures in cross-functional reasoning,
including fragile specifications, misalignment between implementations and
proofs, and unstable reasoning. DafnyCOMP thus provides a diagnostic tool for
measuring progress toward reliable, verifiable, and compositional code
generation with LLMs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'logical pinning,' a borrowing model in separation logic for better handling of container-internal pointers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in specifying and verifying container APIs that temporarily expose their internal pointers, which traditional separation logics struggle with.

Method: The authors generalize the magic-wand operator to enable precise specifications and logical tracking of container-internal pointers in most separation logic frameworks.

Result: The approach is demonstrated through verification of small programs and precise versions of container specifications, mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant using the CFML library.

Conclusion: Logical pinning improves modular reasoning in separation logics, simplifies proofs, and supports program patterns previously difficult or unsupported in traditional specifications.

Abstract: Most separation logics hide container-internal pointers for modularity. This
makes it difficult to specify container APIs that temporarily expose those
pointers to the outside, and to verify programs that use these APIs. We present
logical pinning, a lightweight borrowing model for sequential programs that
allows users to selectively track container-internal pointers at the logical
level. Our model generalizes the magic-wand operator, making it easy to write
and prove precise specifications, including pointer-stability properties.
Because it only changes how representation predicates and specifications are
written, our approach is compatible with most separation logic variants. We
demonstrate the practicality of logical pinning by verifying small but
representative pointer-manipulating programs, and deriving more precise
versions of common container specifications. In doing so, we show that our
approach subsumes some well-known proof patterns, simplifies some complex
proofs, and enables reasoning about program patterns not supported by
traditional specifications. All of our results are mechanized in the Rocq proof
assistant, using the CFML library.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper addresses synthesizing loops with polynomial invariants using algebraic geometry tools and SMT solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating the generation of polynomial invariants for loops in program verification remains undecidable. Synthesizing loops from these invariants presents a promising alternative, but previous methods were limited in scope.

Method: The authors developed an algorithm using algebraic geometry to compute polynomial equations representing nondeterministic branching loops. They also introduce an efficient algorithm for a new class of invariants.

Result: The approach reduces loop synthesis to solving multivariate polynomial systems with rational entries using an SMT solver.

Conclusion: This advanced framework expands loop synthesis capabilities, enabling support for polynomial update maps, guard conditions, and general polynomial invariants.

Abstract: Ensuring software correctness remains a fundamental challenge in formal
program verification. One promising approach relies on finding polynomial
invariants for loops. Polynomial invariants are properties of a program loop
that hold before and after each iteration. Generating such invariants is a
crucial task in loop analysis, but it is undecidable in the general case.
Recently, an alternative approach to this problem has emerged, focusing on
synthesizing loops from invariants. However, existing methods only synthesize
affine loops without guard conditions from polynomial invariants. In this
paper, we address a more general problem, allowing loops to have polynomial
update maps with a given structure, inequations in the guard condition, and
polynomial invariants of arbitrary form.
  We use algebraic geometry tools to design and implement an algorithm that
computes a finite set of polynomial equations whose solutions correspond to all
nondeterministic branching loops satisfying the given invariants. Furthermore,
we introduce a new class of invariants for which we present a significantly
more efficient algorithm. In other words, we reduce the problem of synthesizing
loops to find solutions of multivariate polynomial systems with rational
entries. This final step is handled in our software using an SMT solver.

Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the accuracy and robustness of indoor mobile robot localization by addressing the limitations of individual localization methods like IPS and wheel odometry.

Method: The methodology involves combining data from ultrasound-based IPS and wheel odometry using an Extended Kalman Filter for sensor fusion.

Result: The fusion-based system significantly improves localization accuracy and precision, as well as trajectory tracking, in controlled indoor environments by mitigating issues like wheel slippage and sensor noise.

Conclusion: Integrating IPS with wheel odometry via EKF results in a robust and reliable localization solution, superior to standalone methods.

Abstract: Accurate localization is crucial for effectively operating mobile robots in
indoor environments. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to mobile
robot localization by integrating an ultrasound-based indoor positioning system
(IPS) with wheel odometry data via sensor fusion techniques. The fusion
methodology leverages the strengths of both IPS and wheel odometry,
compensating for the individual limitations of each method. The Extended Kalman
Filter (EKF) fusion method combines the data from the IPS sensors and the

Extensive experiments in a controlled indoor environment reveal that the

Abstract: This paper introduces a proposed control method for autonomous personal
mobility vehicles, specifically the Single-passenger Electric Autonomous
Transporter (SEATER), using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). The
proposed method leverages a single-shooting approach to solve the optimal
control problem (OCP) via non-linear programming (NLP). The proposed NMPC is
implemented to a non-holonomic vehicle with a differential drive system, using
odometry data as localization feedback to guide the vehicle towards its target
pose while achieving objectives and adhering to constraints, such as obstacle
avoidance. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, a number of
simulations have been conducted in both obstacle-free and static obstacle
environments. The SEATER model and testing environment have been developed in
the Gazebo Simulation and the NMPC are implemented within the Robot Operating
System (ROS) framework. The simulation results demonstrate that the NMPC-based
approach successfully controls the vehicle to reach the desired target location
while satisfying the imposed constraints. Furthermore, this study highlights
the robustness and real-time effectiveness of NMPC with a single-shooting
approach for autonomous vehicle control in the evaluated scenarios.

*Zhitao Wang,Yanke Wang,Jiangtao Wen,Roberto Horowitz,Yuxing Han*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReSeFlow, an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model integrating rectified flows for robotic manipulation, achieving rapid and efficient policy generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of inference time costs in SE(3)-equivariant diffusion models while preserving their advantages for robust robotic manipulation in unstructured environments.

Method: ReSeFlow integrates SE(3)-equivariant networks with rectified flows, ensuring geodesic-consistent and efficient policy generation using only one inference step.

Result: ReSeFlow achieves better performance with lower geodesic distances, reducing errors up to 48.5% in painting tasks and 21.9% in rotating triangle tasks compared to methods requiring 100 inference steps.

Conclusion: The approach combines SE(3)-equivariance and rectified flows for efficient generative policy learning, laying foundations for real-world applications in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires the generation of
robust and long-horizon trajectory-level policy with conditions of perceptual
observations and benefits from the advantages of SE(3)-equivariant diffusion
models that are data-efficient. However, these models suffer from the inference
time costs. Inspired by the inference efficiency of rectified flows, we
introduce the rectification to the SE(3)-diffusion models and propose the
ReSeFlow, i.e., Rectifying SE(3)-Equivariant Policy Learning Flows, providing
fast, geodesic-consistent, least-computational policy generation. Crucially,
both components employ SE(3)-equivariant networks to preserve rotational and
translational symmetry, enabling robust generalization under rigid-body
motions. With the verification on the simulated benchmarks, we find that the
proposed ReSeFlow with only one inference step can achieve better performance
with lower geodesic distance than the baseline methods, achieving up to a 48.5%
error reduction on the painting task and a 21.9% reduction on the rotating
triangle task compared to the baseline's 100-step inference. This method takes
advantages of both SE(3) equivariance and rectified flow and puts it forward
for the real-world application of generative policy learning models with the
data and inference efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper proposes MASTAVN, a scalable multi-agent framework for collaborative audio-visual navigation in 3D environments, achieving enhanced task performance in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of single-agent audio-visual navigation systems in dynamic, time-sensitive 3D scenarios such as emergency responses.

Method: MASTAVN employs cross-agent communication protocols and joint audio-visual fusion, allowing two agents to collaboratively navigate towards audio targets in shared 3D environments.

Result: MASTAVN demonstrates improved task completion times and higher navigation success rates in photorealistic simulations compared to single-agent and non-collaborative baselines.

Conclusion: The research underscores the importance of spatiotemporal coordination in multi-agent systems and sets a new standard for scalable multi-agent embodied intelligence in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Intelligent agents often require collaborative strategies to achieve complex
tasks beyond individual capabilities in real-world scenarios. While existing
audio-visual navigation (AVN) research mainly focuses on single-agent systems,
their limitations emerge in dynamic 3D environments where rapid multi-agent
coordination is critical, especially for time-sensitive applications like
emergency response. This paper introduces MASTAVN (Multi-Agent Scalable
Transformer Audio-Visual Navigation), a scalable framework enabling two agents
to collaboratively localize and navigate toward an audio target in shared 3D
environments. By integrating cross-agent communication protocols and joint
audio-visual fusion mechanisms, MASTAVN enhances spatial reasoning and temporal
synchronization. Through rigorous evaluation in photorealistic 3D simulators
(Replica and Matterport3D), MASTAVN achieves significant reductions in task
completion time and notable improvements in navigation success rates compared
to single-agent and non-collaborative baselines. This highlights the essential
role of spatiotemporal coordination in multi-agent systems. Our findings
validate MASTAVN's effectiveness in time-sensitive emergency scenarios and
establish a paradigm for advancing scalable multi-agent embodied intelligence
in complex 3D environments.

*Hung-Ying Chu,Guan-Wei Chen,Shao-Yu Wei,Yu-Cheng Lin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores using fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) for 3D IC space planning, achieving zero-dead-space layouts in many test cases while ensuring runtime efficiency and spatial legality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of effective space planning in 3D integrated circuits, crucial for minimizing dead space and ensuring efficient layouts as design complexity grows.

Method: The authors use a post-order slicing tree representation to guarantee legal space plans, fine-tune open-source LLMs on synthetic datasets, and evaluate the approach on MCNC benchmarks.

Result: The proposed approach achieves zero-dead-space layouts in a significant number of cases under practical runtime budgets, offering scalability and applicability beyond synthetic benchmarks.

Conclusion: LLM-based space planning complements traditional EDA methods by delivering scalable, data-driven solutions for 3D layout generation and showing promise for other domains requiring spatial efficiency.

Abstract: Three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs) have emerged as a promising
solution to the scaling limits of two-dimensional designs, offering higher
integration density, shorter interconnects, and improved performance. As design
complexity increases, effective space planning becomes essential to reduce dead
space and ensure layout quality. This study investigates the use of large
language models (LLMs) for 3D IC space planning through a post-order slicing
tree representation, which guarantees legal space plans while aiming to
minimize dead space. Open-source LLMs were fine-tuned on large-scale synthetic
datasets and further evaluated on MCNC-derived 3D benchmarks. Experimental
results indicate that the proposed framework achieves a favorable balance
between runtime efficiency, legality, and dead-space reduction, with
zero-dead-space layouts obtained in a significant portion of test cases under
practical runtime budgets. Beyond synthetic benchmarks, the method generalizes
to MCNC cases such as ami33 and ami49, though larger and irregular instances
remain challenging. The approach also shows potential for cross-domain
applications, including logistics and 3D object placement, where spatial
efficiency is critical. Overall, the results suggest that LLM-based space
planning can serve as a data-driven complement to traditional electronic design
automation (EDA) methods, providing new insights for scalable 3D layout
generation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces PAMR, a new method for jointly mapping lane geometry and traffic rules persistently over time while improving evaluation tools with MapDRv2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving systems struggle with continuously integrating traffic rules and geometry into HD maps, especially across extended driving sequences.

Method: PAMR introduces the Map-Rule Co-Construction and Map-Rule Cache mechanisms to improve lane vector and traffic rule mapping with visual inputs.

Result: Experiments reveal PAMR delivers better accuracy and persistence in creating map-rule data compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: PAMR sets a foundation for improved autonomous driving by ensuring persistent rule consistency and accurate map generation through advanced mapping techniques.

Abstract: Safe autonomous driving requires both accurate HD map construction and
persistent awareness of traffic rules, even when their associated signs are no
longer visible. However, existing methods either focus solely on geometric
elements or treat rules as temporary classifications, failing to capture their
persistent effectiveness across extended driving sequences. In this paper, we
present PAMR (Persistent Autoregressive Mapping with Traffic Rules), a novel
framework that performs autoregressive co-construction of lane vectors and
traffic rules from visual observations. Our approach introduces two key
mechanisms: Map-Rule Co-Construction for processing driving scenes in temporal
segments, and Map-Rule Cache for maintaining rule consistency across these
segments. To properly evaluate continuous and consistent map generation, we
develop MapDRv2, featuring improved lane geometry annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PAMR achieves superior performance in joint
vector-rule mapping tasks, while maintaining persistent rule effectiveness
throughout extended driving sequences.

Result: Progress is reviewed, highlighting the identification of component characteristics, investigation of best practices, and preliminary development of improved modular pipelines.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates potential for the COMPARE Ecosystem to standardize modular practices, thereby facilitating progress in robot manipulation technologies.

Abstract: The COMPARE Ecosystem aims to improve the compatibility and benchmarking of

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive control framework for quadrupedal robots that enhance human-robot collaboration safety during teleoperation in obstacle avoidance tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current shared control strategies for legged robot autonomy struggle with safety and dynamic adaptation to human behavior in cluttered environments.

Method: The paper employs an adaptive nonlinear model predictive control framework, which integrates human input modeling via a Boltzmann model, while utilizing control barrier functions for safety and hierarchical control for real-time execution.

Result: The framework achieved real-time obstacle avoidance, learned human intent parameters online, and enabled safe collaboration validated by experiments and user studies on a quadrupedal robot.

Conclusion: This adaptive control framework advances shared autonomy by ensuring safety and improving collaboration between humans and legged robots in dynamic teleoperation scenarios.

Abstract: Ensuring safe and effective collaboration between humans and autonomous
legged robots is a fundamental challenge in shared autonomy, particularly for
teleoperated systems navigating cluttered environments. Conventional
shared-control approaches often rely on fixed blending strategies that fail to
capture the dynamics of legged locomotion and may compromise safety. This paper
presents a teleoperator-aware, safety-critical, adaptive nonlinear model
predictive control (ANMPC) framework for shared autonomy of quadrupedal robots
in obstacle-avoidance tasks. The framework employs a fixed arbitration weight
between human and robot actions but enhances this scheme by modeling the human
input with a noisily rational Boltzmann model, whose parameters are adapted
online using a projected gradient descent (PGD) law from observed joystick
commands. Safety is enforced through control barrier function (CBF) constraints
integrated into a computationally efficient NMPC, ensuring forward invariance
of safe sets despite uncertainty in human behavior. The control architecture is
hierarchical: a high-level CBF-based ANMPC (10 Hz) generates blended
human-robot velocity references, a mid-level dynamics-aware NMPC (60 Hz)
enforces reduced-order single rigid body (SRB) dynamics to track these
references, and a low-level nonlinear whole-body controller (500 Hz) imposes
the full-order dynamics via quadratic programming to track the mid-level
trajectories. Extensive numerical and hardware experiments, together with a
user study, on a Unitree Go2 quadrupedal robot validate the framework,
demonstrating real-time obstacle avoidance, online learning of human intent
parameters, and safe teleoperator collaboration.

*Philip Sanderink,Yingfan Zhou,Shuzhen Luo,Cheng Fang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study introduces a novel method for parameter identification in human musculoskeletal modeling by indirect leveraging of deep muscle forces. This removes the dependency on invasive EMG measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a pressing need for accurate and subject-specific musculoskeletal model parameters for reliable and safe usage in collaborative robotic systems, especially assistive exoskeletons. Existing methods relying on deep muscle EMG measurements are often invasive and challenging.

Method: The authors approach parameter identification by avoiding direct reconstruction of deep muscle EMGs. Instead, they use a least-squares solution for deep muscle forces and apply a differentiable optimization framework to identify parameters solely with superficial muscle data.

Result: Simulation comparisons demonstrate that the proposed method achieves estimation accuracy on par with methods requiring invasive deep muscle EMG data.

Conclusion: The study succeeds in providing a less invasive and more accessible approach for subject-specific musculoskeletal modeling without compromising the accuracy of parameter identification.

Abstract: Accurate parameter identification of a subject-specific human musculoskeletal
model is crucial to the development of safe and reliable physically
collaborative robotic systems, for instance, assistive exoskeletons.
Electromyography (EMG)-based parameter identification methods have demonstrated
promising performance for personalized musculoskeletal modeling, whereas their
applicability is limited by the difficulty of measuring deep muscle EMGs
invasively. Although several strategies have been proposed to reconstruct deep
muscle EMGs or activations for parameter identification, their reliability and
robustness are limited by assumptions about the deep muscle behavior. In this
work, we proposed an approach to simultaneously identify the bone and
superficial muscle parameters of a human arm musculoskeletal model without
reconstructing the deep muscle EMGs. This is achieved by only using the
least-squares solution of the deep muscle forces to calculate a loss gradient
with respect to the model parameters for identifying them in a framework of
differentiable optimization. The results of extensive comparative simulations
manifested that our proposed method can achieve comparable estimation accuracy
compared to a similar method, but with all the muscle EMGs available.

*Arman Barghi,Hamed Hosseini,Seraj Ghasemi,Mehdi Tale Masouleh,Ahmad Kalhor*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel planning method called Dynamic Buffer, which enables robots to improve object rearrangement efficiency in cluttered tabletop environments by forming movable stacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for rearranging objects in cluttered environments are inefficient due to individual object manipulation and static buffers, leading to high-cost plans and complications in dense scenes.

Method: The Dynamic Buffer approach allows robots to create temporary, movable stacks that can function as a unit, inspired by human grouping strategies. This approach reduces inefficiencies found in conventional static stacking.

Result: Dynamic Buffer reduces manipulator travel cost by 11.89% in dense scenarios with a stationary robot and by 5.69% in low-density scenarios with a mobile manipulator, validated through practical experiments.

Conclusion: The concept of dynamic buffering significantly enhances cost efficiency and robustness in robotic object rearrangement, establishing it as a promising primitive for future advancements.

Abstract: Rearranging objects in cluttered tabletop environments remains a
long-standing challenge in robotics. Classical planners often generate
inefficient, high-cost plans by shuffling objects individually and using fixed
buffers--temporary spaces such as empty table regions or static stacks--to
resolve conflicts. When only free table locations are used as buffers, dense
scenes become inefficient, since placing an object can restrict others from
reaching their goals and complicate planning. Allowing stacking provides extra
buffer capacity, but conventional stacking is static: once an object supports
another, the base cannot be moved, which limits efficiency. To overcome these
issues, a novel planning primitive called the Dynamic Buffer is introduced.
Inspired by human grouping strategies, it enables robots to form temporary,
movable stacks that can be transported as a unit. This improves both
feasibility and efficiency in dense layouts, and it also reduces travel in
large-scale settings where space is abundant. Compared with a state-of-the-art
rearrangement planner, the approach reduces manipulator travel cost by 11.89%
in dense scenarios with a stationary robot and by 5.69% in large, low-density
settings with a mobile manipulator. Practicality is validated through
experiments on a Delta parallel robot with a two-finger gripper. These findings
establish dynamic buffering as a key primitive for cost-efficient and robust
rearrangement planning.

*Brandon Vu,Shameek Ganguly,Pushkar Joshi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Empart, a tool for interactive region-specific 3D mesh simplification, improving simulation by reducing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D mesh simplification methods apply uniform error tolerance, leading to sub-optimal performance in robotics tasks needing detailed geometry in critical regions while tolerating coarser details elsewhere.

Method: The authors propose Empart, which uses existing convex decomposition algorithms within a novel parallel framework, allowing region-specific constraints and providing a user-friendly interface for refinement with visual feedback.

Result: Empart significantly reduces the number of convex parts compared to V-HACD at similar error thresholds, resulting in faster simulation performance. For a robotic pick-and-place task, it reduced overall simulation time by 69%.

Conclusion: Empart outperforms state-of-the-art methods by enabling targeted simplification of 3D meshes, optimizing both accuracy and simulation speed for robotics applications.

Abstract: Simplifying complex 3D meshes is a crucial step in robotics applications to
enable efficient motion planning and physics simulation. Common methods, such
as approximate convex decomposition, represent a mesh as a collection of simple
parts, which are computationally inexpensive to simulate. However, existing
approaches apply a uniform error tolerance across the entire mesh, which can
result in a sub-optimal trade-off between accuracy and performance. For
instance, a robot grasping an object needs high-fidelity geometry in the
vicinity of the contact surfaces but can tolerate a coarser simplification
elsewhere. A uniform tolerance can lead to excessive detail in non-critical
areas or insufficient detail where it's needed most.
  To address this limitation, we introduce Empart, an interactive tool that
allows users to specify different simplification tolerances for selected
regions of a mesh. Our method leverages existing convex decomposition
algorithms as a sub-routine but uses a novel, parallelized framework to handle
region-specific constraints efficiently. Empart provides a user-friendly
interface with visual feedback on approximation error and simulation
performance, enabling designers to iteratively refine their decomposition. We
demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the number of convex parts
compared to a state-of-the-art method (V-HACD) at a fixed error threshold,
leading to substantial speedups in simulation performance. For a robotic
pick-and-place task, Empart-generated collision meshes reduced the overall
simulation time by 69% compared to a uniform decomposition, highlighting the
value of interactive, region-specific simplification for performant robotics
applications.

*Kaleb Ben Naveed,Haejoon Lee,Dimitra Panagou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-robot framework to estimate fields (like wind or temperature) in environments with varying spatial and temporal dynamics, using Gaussian Process models with adaptive lengthscales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing Gaussian Process models which assume global lengthscales or ignore temporal dynamics, thereby producing inaccurate uncertainty estimates in non-uniform spatiotemporal environments.

Method: The framework operates in two phases: (1) A variogram-driven planning phase for learning region-specific spatial lengthscales, and (2) A dynamic allocation phase where robots are reassigned based on updated uncertainty and temporal lengthscale refinement.

Result: The proposed approach is evaluated across different environments, demonstrating its effectiveness. The paper also includes convergence results for spatial lengthscale learning and dynamic regret bounds for robot allocation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully improves multi-robot spatiotemporal field estimation by adapting to non-uniform environments and refining both spatial and temporal lengthscales dynamically.

Abstract: Autonomous robots are increasingly deployed to estimate spatiotemporal fields
(e.g., wind, temperature, gas concentration) that vary across space and time.
We consider environments divided into non-overlapping regions with distinct
spatial and temporal dynamics, termed non-uniform spatiotemporal environments.
Gaussian Processes (GPs) can be used to estimate these fields. The GP model
depends on a kernel that encodes how the field co-varies in space and time,
with its spatial and temporal lengthscales defining the correlation. Hence,
when these lengthscales are incorrect or do not correspond to the actual field,
the estimates of uncertainty can be highly inaccurate. Existing GP methods
often assume one global lengthscale or update only periodically; some allow
spatial variation but ignore temporal changes. To address these limitations, we
propose a two-phase framework for multi-robot field estimation. Phase 1 uses a
variogram-driven planner to learn region-specific spatial lengthscales. Phase 2
employs an allocation strategy that reassigns robots based on the current
uncertainty, and updates sampling as temporal lengthscales are refined. For
encoding uncertainty, we utilize clarity, an information metric from our
earlier work. We evaluate the proposed method across diverse environments and
provide convergence analysis for spatial lengthscale estimation, along with
dynamic regret bounds quantifying the gap to the oracle's allocation sequence.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The Good Weights algorithm dynamically integrates dead reckoning with visual SLAM to improve pose estimation, especially in visually degraded environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address visual SLAM's performance flaws in texture-less or low-visibility settings, leveraging reliability from dead reckoning sensors in such scenarios.

Method: Proposes the Good Weights (GW) algorithm which adaptively balances influence between dead reckoning and visual SLAM based on environmental conditions.

Result: Improved pose estimation and robustness in SLAM, as demonstrated by experiments on datasets and real-world use cases.

Conclusion: This adaptive integration approach enhances mobile robot navigation systems, making SLAM more effective in challenging environments.

Abstract: Given that Visual SLAM relies on appearance cues for localization and scene
understanding, texture-less or visually degraded environments (e.g., plain
walls or low lighting) lead to poor pose estimation and track loss. However,
robots are typically equipped with sensors that provide some form of dead
reckoning odometry with reasonable short-time performance but unreliable
long-time performance. The Good Weights (GW) algorithm described here provides
a framework to adaptively integrate dead reckoning (DR) with passive visual
SLAM for continuous and accurate frame-level pose estimation. Importantly, it
describes how all modules in a comprehensive SLAM system must be modified to
incorporate DR into its design. Adaptive weighting increases DR influence when
visual tracking is unreliable and reduces when visual feature information is
strong, maintaining pose track without overreliance on DR. Good Weights yields
a practical solution for mobile navigation that improves visual SLAM
performance and robustness. Experiments on collected datasets and in real-world
deployment demonstrate the benefits of Good Weights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional imitation learning methods that require cumbersome hardware setups, making it difficult for scalable data collection.

Method: ARMimic combines egocentric hand tracking, AR robot overlays, and depth sensing via a XR headset and stationary camera for capturing kinematically feasible demonstrations.

Result: ARMimic demonstrated a 50% reduction in demonstration time and an 11% improvement in task success compared to state-of-the-art methods like ACT.

Conclusion: ARMimic simplifies and enhances imitation learning by enabling scalable and efficient data collection in diverse environments without relying on complex hardware setups.

Abstract: Imitation learning is a powerful paradigm for robot skill acquisition, yet
conventional demonstration methods--such as kinesthetic teaching and
teleoperation--are cumbersome, hardware-heavy, and disruptive to workflows.
Recently, passive observation using extended reality (XR) headsets has shown
promise for egocentric demonstration collection, yet current approaches require
additional hardware, complex calibration, or constrained recording conditions
that limit scalability and usability. We present ARMimic, a novel framework
that overcomes these limitations with a lightweight and hardware-minimal setup
for scalable, robot-free data collection using only a consumer XR headset and a
stationary workplace camera. ARMimic integrates egocentric hand tracking,
augmented reality (AR) robot overlays, and real-time depth sensing to ensure
collision-aware, kinematically feasible demonstrations. A unified imitation
learning pipeline is at the core of our method, treating both human and virtual
robot trajectories as interchangeable, which enables policies that generalize
across different embodiments and environments. We validate ARMimic on two
manipulation tasks, including challenging long-horizon bowl stacking. In our
experiments, ARMimic reduces demonstration time by 50% compared to
teleoperation and improves task success by 11% over ACT, a state-of-the-art
baseline trained on teleoperated data. Our results demonstrate that ARMimic
enables safe, seamless, and in-the-wild data collection, offering great
potential for scalable robot learning in diverse real-world settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new Bayesian Inference-based approach for generating collision-free overtaking trajectories in autonomous racing, offering better performance than current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for autonomous racing overtaking maneuvers often make oversimplified assumptions about vehicle dynamics and collision avoidance.

Method: The paper employs an extended Differential Bayesian Filtering (DBF) framework to synthesize trajectories using Bayesian Inference over Composite Bezier Curves. The approach avoids derivative-based optimization and simplifying assumptions.

Result: The proposed method achieves successful autonomous overtaking maneuvers in 87% of tested scenarios, outperforming existing techniques.

Conclusion: The novel DBF-MA approach offers a robust, assumption-free model for trajectory synthesis in autonomous racing, demonstrating strong potential in complex racing environments.

Abstract: A significant challenge in autonomous racing is to generate overtaking
maneuvers. Racing agents must execute these maneuvers on complex racetracks
with little room for error. Optimization techniques and graph-based methods
have been proposed, but these methods often rely on oversimplified assumptions
for collision-avoidance and dynamic constraints. In this work, we present an
approach to trajectory synthesis based on an extension of the Differential
Bayesian Filtering framework. Our approach for collision-free trajectory
synthesis frames the problem as one of Bayesian Inference over the space of
Composite Bezier Curves. Our method is derivative-free, does not require a
spherical approximation of the vehicle footprint, linearization of constraints,
or simplifying upper bounds on collision avoidance. We conduct a closed-loop
analysis of DBF-MA and find it successfully overtakes an opponent in 87% of
tested scenarios, outperforming existing methods in autonomous overtaking.

### [1048] [Safe Task Space Synchronization with Time-Delayed Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22976)
*Rounak Bhattacharya,Vrithik R. Guthikonda,Ashwin P. Dani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive controller for human-robot motion synchronization with safety constraints, handling time delays using advanced algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable safe and effective human-robot collaboration despite unknown robot parameters and communication time delays.

Method: The paper employs Barrier Lyapunov Functions, adaptive laws, and Krasovskii functionals for designing and analyzing a robust controller.

Result: The developed controller ensures bounded synchronization errors and safety, as demonstrated via simulation under delayed conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed controller ensures effective synchronization with safety, showing potential for practical applications in human-robot collaboration.

Abstract: In this paper, an adaptive controller is designed for the synchronization of
the trajectory of a robot with unknown kinematics and dynamics to that of the
current human trajectory in the task space using the delayed human trajectory
information. The communication time delay may be a result of various factors
that arise in human-robot collaboration tasks, such as sensor processing or
fusion to estimate trajectory/intent, network delays, or computational
limitations. The developed adaptive controller uses Barrier Lyapunov Function
(BLF) to constrain the Cartesian coordinates of the robot to ensure safety, an
ICL-based adaptive law to account for the unknown kinematics, and a
gradient-based adaptive law to estimate unknown dynamics. Barrier
Lyapunov-Krasovskii (LK) functionals are used for the stability analysis to
show that the synchronization and parameter estimation errors remain
semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). The simulation results
based on a human-robot synchronization scenario with time delay are provided to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed synchronization controller with
safety constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation often suffers from limited training data compared to human motion learning resources, hindering knowledge transfer and adaptability.

Method: UniPrototype employs compositional prototype discovery, adaptive prototype selection strategies, and aligns human and robot motion primitives to achieve knowledge transfer.

Result: Experiments showed that the UniPrototype framework significantly enhances robot learning efficiency and task performance in simulations and real-world settings.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates a scalable method to bridge the gap between human and robot manipulation capabilities, providing a new direction in robot learning.

Abstract: Data scarcity remains a fundamental challenge in robot learning. While human
demonstrations benefit from abundant motion capture data and vast internet
resources, robotic manipulation suffers from limited training examples. To
bridge this gap between human and robot manipulation capabilities, we propose
UniPrototype, a novel framework that enables effective knowledge transfer from
human to robot domains via shared motion primitives. ur approach makes three
key contributions: (1) We introduce a compositional prototype discovery
mechanism with soft assignments, enabling multiple primitives to co-activate
and thus capture blended and hierarchical skills; (2) We propose an adaptive
prototype selection strategy that automatically adjusts the number of
prototypes to match task complexity, ensuring scalable and efficient
representation; (3) We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through
extensive experiments in both simulation environments and real-world robotic
systems. Our results show that UniPrototype successfully transfers human
manipulation knowledge to robots, significantly improving learning efficiency
and task performance compared to existing approaches.The code and dataset will
be released upon acceptance at an anonymous repository.

TL;DR: The paper presents a low-cost automated system to disassemble and sort End-of-Life (EoL) phones efficiently, aiming to solve challenges associated with e-waste recycling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EoL phones contribute to global e-waste challenges due to high production volume and human-dependent, inefficient manual disassembly.

Method: A system comprising three subsystems: adaptive cutting, vision-based robotic sorting, and battery removal, processes phones automatedly and selectively.

Result: The system achieves a disassembly success rate of 98.9% and processes over 120 phones per hour, improving efficiency and the economic feasibility of recycling.

Conclusion: This automated system addresses inefficiencies in EoL phone disassembly, offering a scalable and profitable recycling solution.

Abstract: End-of-Life (EoL) phones significantly exacerbate global e-waste challenges
due to their high production volumes and short lifecycles. Disassembly is among
the most critical processes in EoL phone recycling. However, it relies heavily
on human labor due to product variability. Consequently, the manual process is
both labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a low-cost,
easily deployable automated and selective disassembly and sorting system for
EoL phones, consisting of three subsystems: an adaptive cutting system, a
vision-based robotic sorting system, and a battery removal system. The system
can process over 120 phones per hour with an average disassembly success rate
of 98.9%, efficiently delivering selected high-value components to downstream
processing. It provides a reliable and scalable automated solution to the
pressing challenge of EoL phone disassembly. Additionally, the automated system
can enhance disassembly economics, converting a previously unprofitable process
into one that yields a net profit per unit weight of EoL phones.

### [1051] [In-Hand Manipulation of Articulated Tools with Dexterous Robot Hands with Sim-to-Real Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23075)
*Soofiyan Atar,Daniel Huang,Florian Richter,Michael Yip*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for in-hand manipulation of articulated tools using robot hands with limited articulation, demonstrating robust sim-to-real transfer, resilience to disturbances, and generalization to unseen tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome challenges in robotic manipulation of articulated mechanisms, which are complicated by contact-rich dynamics and phenomena like friction and backlash, areas where current methods struggle.

Method: A hybrid controller approach is proposed, combining simulation-trained base policies with sensor-driven refinements learned from demonstrations, leveraging proprioception, tactile feedback, and cross-attention integration.

Result: The approach successfully handles real-world articulated tools like scissors and staplers, achieving robustness in sim-to-real transfer, increased disturbance resilience, and generalization to novel tools.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential to reduce dependence on precise physical modeling by enabling robust, generalized manipulation of articulated tools in complex, contact-rich environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) and sim-to-real transfer have advanced robotic
manipulation of rigid objects. Yet, policies remain brittle when applied to
articulated mechanisms due to contact-rich dynamics and under-modeled joint
phenomena such as friction, stiction, backlash, and clearances. We address this
challenge through dexterous in-hand manipulation of articulated tools using a
robotic hand with reduced articulation and kinematic redundancy relative to the
human hand. Our controller augments a simulation-trained base policy with a
sensor-driven refinement learned from hardware demonstrations, conditioning on
proprioception and target articulation states while fusing whole-hand tactile
and force feedback with the policy's internal action intent via
cross-attention-based integration. This design enables online adaptation to
instance-specific articulation properties, stabilizes contact interactions,
regulates internal forces, and coordinates coupled-link motion under
perturbations. We validate our approach across a diversity of real-world
examples, including scissors, pliers, minimally invasive surgical tools, and
staplers. We achieve robust transfer from simulation to hardware, improved
disturbance resilience, and generalization to previously unseen articulated
tools, thereby reducing reliance on precise physical modeling in contact-rich
settings.

### [1052] [Open-Vocabulary Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph for Robot Perception and Teleoperation Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23107)
*Yi Wang,Zeyu Xue,Mujie Liu,Tongqin Zhang,Yan Hu,Zhou Zhao,Chenguang Yang,Zhenyu Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Spatio-Temporal Open-Vocabulary Scene Graph (ST-OVSG), a framework to improve teleoperation in dynamic remote settings by addressing transmission latency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce operator workload and improve safety in teleoperation by addressing challenges related to transmission latency, which can cause misunderstandings and incorrect execution in dynamic remote scenes.

Method: The authors propose ST-OVSG, which combines open-vocabulary perception, temporal dynamics, and latency tagging. Techniques include using LVLMs for 3D object representations, temporal matching via Hungarian assignment, and task-oriented subgraph filtering.

Result: ST-OVSG outperformed previous models, achieving 74% node accuracy on the Replica benchmark. It also significantly improved planning robustness, achieving a planning success rate of 70.5% during latency-robustness evaluations.

Conclusion: ST-OVSG effectively addresses state mismatches caused by latency, generalizes to new categories, and improves teleoperation robustness without requiring fine-tuning.

Abstract: Teleoperation via natural-language reduces operator workload and enhances
safety in high-risk or remote settings. However, in dynamic remote scenes,
transmission latency during bidirectional communication creates gaps between
remote perceived states and operator intent, leading to command
misunderstanding and incorrect execution. To mitigate this, we introduce the
Spatio-Temporal Open-Vocabulary Scene Graph (ST-OVSG), a representation that
enriches open-vocabulary perception with temporal dynamics and lightweight
latency annotations. ST-OVSG leverages LVLMs to construct open-vocabulary 3D
object representations, and extends them into the temporal domain via Hungarian
assignment with our temporal matching cost, yielding a unified spatio-temporal
scene graph. A latency tag is embedded to enable LVLM planners to
retrospectively query past scene states, thereby resolving local-remote state
mismatches caused by transmission delays. To further reduce redundancy and
highlight task-relevant cues, we propose a task-oriented subgraph filtering
strategy that produces compact inputs for the planner. ST-OVSG generalizes to
novel categories and enhances planning robustness against transmission latency
without requiring fine-tuning. Experiments show that our method achieves 74
percent node accuracy on the Replica benchmark, outperforming ConceptGraph.
Notably, in the latency-robustness experiment, the LVLM planner assisted by
ST-OVSG achieved a planning success rate of 70.5 percent.

TL;DR: The study introduces a multimodal dataset optimized for robotic applications under complex interference, improving sensor fusion and operational stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of representing dynamic environmental states in robotic perception and control using multimodal sensor fusion.

Method: The dataset employs high-precision, multimodal sensors to synchronize visual, torque, and joint-state measurements. It uses ROS for temporal fidelity and includes real-world scenarios with lighting gradients and geometric similarity beyond 85%.

Result: The dataset enhances model validation robustness and operational stability for robots in interference-rich environments.

Conclusion: This publicly available dataset provides a valuable resource for improving robotic perception and control in complex industrial settings.

Abstract: In Industry 4.0 applications, dynamic environmental interference induces
highly nonlinear and strongly coupled interactions between the environmental
state and robotic behavior. Effectively representing dynamic environmental
states through multimodal sensor data fusion remains a critical challenge in
current robotic datasets. To address this, an industrial-grade multimodal
interference dataset is presented, designed for robotic perception and control
under complex conditions. The dataset integrates multi-dimensional interference
features including size, color, and lighting variations, and employs
high-precision sensors to synchronously collect visual, torque, and joint-state
measurements. Scenarios with geometric similarity exceeding 85\% and
standardized lighting gradients are included to ensure real-world
representativeness. Microsecond-level time-synchronization and
vibration-resistant data acquisition protocols, implemented via the Robot
Operating System (ROS), guarantee temporal and operational fidelity.
Experimental results demonstrate that the dataset enhances model validation
robustness and improves robotic operational stability in dynamic,
interference-rich environments. The dataset is publicly available

*Ryo Watanabe,Maxime Alvarez,Pablo Ferreiro,Pavel Savkin,Genki Sano*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal Imitation Learning policy using visual, joint state, and force/torque data to improve robot manipulation tasks in retail environments, particularly for handling upright beverage bottles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current robot manipulation systems that rely heavily on visual cues in contact-rich scenarios, which trigger human teleoperation and reduce efficiency.

Method: The authors augment the Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) model with force and torque sensing, enabling end-to-end learning using multimodal data including images, joint states, and forces/torques.

Result: Hardware experiments show improved task success in picking and reorienting bottles using the proposed approach, outperforming a baseline ACT model that lacked force and torque sensing.

Conclusion: Integrating interaction forces as an additional modality in learning systems enhances manipulation capabilities in contact-rich tasks, offering a scalable solution for retail automation.

Abstract: Manipulator robots are increasingly being deployed in retail environments,
yet contact rich edge cases still trigger costly human teleoperation. A
prominent example is upright lying beverage bottles, where purely visual cues
are often insufficient to resolve subtle contact events required for precise
manipulation. We present a multimodal Imitation Learning policy that augments
the Action Chunking Transformer with force and torque sensing, enabling
end-to-end learning over images, joint states, and forces and torques. Deployed
on Ghost, single-arm platform by Telexistence Inc, our approach improves
Pick-and-Reorient bottle task by detecting and exploiting contact transitions
during pressing and placement. Hardware experiments demonstrate greater task
success compared to baseline matching the observation space of ACT as an
ablation and experiments indicate that force and torque signals are beneficial
in the press and place phases where visual observability is limited, supporting
the use of interaction forces as a complementary modality for contact rich
skills. The results suggest a practical path to scaling retail manipulation by
combining modern imitation learning architectures with lightweight force and
torque sensing.

### [1055] [EKF-Based Fusion of Wi-Fi/LiDAR/IMU for Indoor Localization and Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23118)
*Zeyi Li,Zhe Tang,Kyeong Soo Kim,Sihao Li,Jeremy S. Smith*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel multi-sensor indoor localization framework combining Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting, LiDAR-based SLAM, and IMU navigation using EKF to achieve high accuracy while reducing errors and drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional Wi-Fi RSSI indoor localization (low accuracy) and LiDAR-based solutions (high cost and complexity).

Method: The framework uses deep neural network (DNN)-based Wi-Fi fingerprinting for coarse localization, IMU-based dynamic positioning, LiDAR-based SLAM for mapping, and extended Kalman filter (EKF) for sensor fusion to suppress noise and drift errors.

Result: Real-world experiments showed the proposed method achieved stable accuracy with mean 2D errors from 0.2449 m to 0.3781 m, outperforming standalone Wi-Fi- and LiDAR/IMU-based approaches.

Conclusion: Integrating multi-sensor technologies provides a robust and accurate framework for indoor localization, addressing the shortcomings of individual approaches in challenging environments.

Abstract: Conventional Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator (RSSI) fingerprinting
cannot meet the growing demand for accurate indoor localization and navigation
due to its lower accuracy, while solutions based on light detection and ranging
(LiDAR) can provide better localization performance but is limited by their
higher deployment cost and complexity. To address these issues, we propose a
novel indoor localization and navigation framework integrating Wi-Fi RSSI
fingerprinting, LiDAR-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and
inertial measurement unit (IMU) navigation based on an extended Kalman filter
(EKF). Specifically, coarse localization by deep neural network (DNN)-based
Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting is refined by IMU-based dynamic positioning using a
Gmapping-based SLAM to generate an occupancy grid map and output high-frequency
attitude estimates, which is followed by EKF prediction-update integrating
sensor information while effectively suppressing Wi-Fi-induced noise and IMU
drift errors. Multi-group real-world experiments conducted on the IR building
at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University demonstrates that the proposed
multi-sensor fusion framework suppresses the instability caused by individual
approaches and thereby provides stable accuracy across all path configurations
with mean two-dimensional (2D) errors ranging from 0.2449 m to 0.3781 m. In
contrast, the mean 2D errors of Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting reach up to 1.3404 m
in areas with severe signal interference, and those of LiDAR/IMU localization
are between 0.6233 m and 2.8803 m due to cumulative drift.

*Abdul Monaf Chowdhury,Akm Moshiur Rahman Mazumder,Rabeya Akter,Safaeid Hossain Arib*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces LAGEA, a framework where natural language feedback guides robotic agents in learning from their mistakes, leading to improved task success rates in manipulation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic agents lack a systematic method to learn from their own mistakes, and the authors explore whether natural language can serve as an error reasoning signal for self-improvement in robotic manipulation.

Method: LAGEA leverages a vision-language model to generate episodic reflections that are turned into temporally grounded guidance for reinforcement learning. The feedback is aligned with visual states, transformed into step-wise rewards, and modulated by a failure-aware coefficient.

Result: LAGEA improves success rates in the Meta-World MT10 manipulation benchmark by 9.0% on random goals and 5.3% on fixed goals compared to SOTA methods, while achieving faster convergence.

Conclusion: This research supports the idea that structured, time-grounded natural language feedback is a powerful tool for enabling robots to self-reflect, diagnose errors, and improve performance efficiently.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation benefits from foundation models that describe goals, but
today's agents still lack a principled way to learn from their own mistakes. We
ask whether natural language can serve as feedback, an error reasoning signal
that helps embodied agents diagnose what went wrong and correct course. We
introduce LAGEA (Language Guided Embodied Agents), a framework that turns
episodic, schema-constrained reflections from a vision language model (VLM)
into temporally grounded guidance for reinforcement learning. LAGEA summarizes
each attempt in concise language, localizes the decisive moments in the
trajectory, aligns feedback with visual state in a shared representation, and
converts goal progress and feedback agreement into bounded, step-wise shaping
rewardswhose influence is modulated by an adaptive, failure-aware coefficient.
This design yields dense signals early when exploration needs direction and
gracefully recedes as competence grows. On the Meta-World MT10 embodied
manipulation benchmark, LAGEA improves average success over the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 9.0% on random goals and 5.3% on fixed
goals, while converging faster. These results support our hypothesis: language,
when structured and grounded in time, is an effective mechanism for teaching
robots to self-reflect on mistakes and make better choices. Code will be
released soon.

*Ziyi Zhou,Qian Meng,Hadas Kress-Gazit,Ye Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework combining symbolic-level controllers with dynamic footstep planning to enhance quadrupedal locomotion over uncertain terrains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with robustness and computational efficiency for quadrupedal movement on unpredictable terrains.

Method: The approach integrates reactive synthesis for symbolic-level control and mixed-integer convex programming for dynamic footstep planning, along with symbolic repair mechanisms for real-time adaptability.

Result: Simulations and hardware experiments confirm improved adaptability and skill identification in challenging terrain scenarios.

Conclusion: The integrated framework effectively bridges the gap between offline synthesis and real-time operation for robust quadrupedal locomotion.

Abstract: We present an integrated planning framework for quadrupedal locomotion over
dynamically changing, unforeseen terrains. Existing methods often depend on
heuristics for real-time foothold selection-limiting robustness and
adaptability-or rely on computationally intensive trajectory optimization
across complex terrains and long horizons. In contrast, our approach combines
reactive synthesis for generating correct-by-construction symbolic-level
controllers with mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) for dynamic and
physically feasible footstep planning during each symbolic transition. To
reduce the reliance on costly MICP solves and accommodate specifications that
may be violated due to physical infeasibility, we adopt a symbolic repair
mechanism that selectively generates only the required symbolic transitions.
During execution, real-time MICP replanning based on actual terrain data,
combined with runtime symbolic repair and delay-aware coordination, enables
seamless bridging between offline synthesis and online operation. Through
extensive simulation and hardware experiments, we validate the framework's
ability to identify missing locomotion skills and respond effectively in
safety-critical environments, including scattered stepping stones and rebar
scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CE-Nav introduces a new navigation framework that decouples universal geometric reasoning from robot-specific dynamic adaptation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with low adaptation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in generalizing local navigation across diverse robot morphologies, tackling issues like costly data, tight coupling of planning and control, and deterministic model limitations for multi-modal decisions.

Method: The method has two stages: training a General Expert (VelFlow) using offline imitation learning on classical planner data, followed by adapting it to specific robots via online reinforcement learning with a lightweight Dynamics-Aware Refiner.

Result: CE-Nav performs excellently across different robots (e.g., quadrupeds, bipeds, quadrotors) and proves effective for real-world navigation tasks while minimizing adaptation costs.

Conclusion: This framework is efficient and scalable, offering an innovative solution for building versatile navigation systems applicable to varying robot morphologies.

Abstract: Generalizing local navigation policies across diverse robot morphologies is a
critical challenge. Progress is often hindered by the need for costly and
embodiment-specific data, the tight coupling of planning and control, and the
"disastrous averaging" problem where deterministic models fail to capture
multi-modal decisions (e.g., turning left or right). We introduce CE-Nav, a
novel two-stage (IL-then-RL) framework that systematically decouples universal
geometric reasoning from embodiment-specific dynamic adaptation. First, we
train an embodiment-agnostic General Expert offline using imitation learning.
This expert, a conditional normalizing flow model named VelFlow, learns the
full distribution of kinematically-sound actions from a large-scale dataset
generated by a classical planner, completely avoiding real robot data and
resolving the multi-modality issue. Second, for a new robot, we freeze the
expert and use it as a guiding prior to train a lightweight, Dynamics-Aware
Refiner via online reinforcement learning. This refiner rapidly learns to
compensate for the target robot's specific dynamics and controller
imperfections with minimal environmental interaction. Extensive experiments on
quadrupeds, bipeds, and quadrotors show that CE-Nav achieves state-of-the-art
performance while drastically reducing adaptation cost. Successful real-world
deployments further validate our approach as an efficient and scalable solution
for building generalizable navigation systems.

*Benjamin Wong,Aaron Weber,Mohamed M. Safwat,Santosh Devasia,Ashis G. Banerjee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes using simulated annealing to optimize sampling distributions for multi-robot active information acquisition, improving both transient and long-term performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active information acquisition aims to ensure consistent quality across regions by minimizing uncertainty, but achieving this is challenging due to unknown and fluctuating noise levels.

Method: The method uses simulated annealing with a Boltzmann distribution to gradually adjust the sampling distribution from a uniform to an optimal one based on estimated sampling entropy.

Result: Simulation results show significant improvements in both transient and asymptotic entropy over traditional methods, and the system was successfully validated with TurtleBot robots.

Conclusion: Simulated annealing proves effective in balancing observation quality for multi-robot systems, offering a robust solution for handling noisy and uncertain environments.

Abstract: One of the goals of active information acquisition using multi-robot teams is
to keep the relative uncertainty in each region at the same level to maintain
identical acquisition quality (e.g., consistent target detection) in all the
regions. To achieve this goal, ergodic coverage can be used to assign the
number of samples according to the quality of observation, i.e., sampling noise
levels. However, the noise levels are unknown to the robots. Although this
noise can be estimated from samples, the estimates are unreliable at first and
can generate fluctuating values. The main contribution of this paper is to use
simulated annealing to generate the target sampling distribution, starting from
uniform and gradually shifting to an estimated optimal distribution, by varying
the coldness parameter of a Boltzmann distribution with the estimated sampling
entropy as energy. Simulation results show a substantial improvement of both
transient and asymptotic entropy compared to both uniform and direct-ergodic
searches. Finally, a demonstration is performed with a TurtleBot swarm system
to validate the physical applicability of the algorithm.

### [1060] [GLUE: Global-Local Unified Encoding for Imitation Learning via Key-Patch Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23220)
*Ye Chen,Zichen Zhou,Jianyu Dou,Te Cui,Yi Yang,Yufeng Yue*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GLUE introduces a unified global-local visual encoding mechanism to improve robotic imitation learning in cluttered environments by focusing on task-relevant objects through key-patch tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses performance degradation in robotic imitation learning caused by OOD settings like clutter and occlusion, proposing the use of local representations for improved feature mapping and reduced covariate shift.

Method: GLUE tracks key-patches using a text-guided mechanism and fuses global and local visual features to generate fine-grained, task-relevant representations that align training and testing data distributions.

Result: GLUE delivers strong performance, outperforming baselines by significant margins: 17.6% better in simulation, 36.3% superior in real-world environments, and 58.3% better in generalization settings.

Conclusion: GLUE enhances policy robustness in robotic imitation learning by steering visual attention effectively and preserving coherent global and local contexts, especially in challenging OOD scenarios.

Abstract: In recent years, visual representation learning has gained widespread
attention in robotic imitation learning. However, in complex
Out-of-Distribution(OOD) settings characterized by clutter and occlusion, the
attention of global visual representations can be diluted or interfered,
leading to degraded policy performance. The invariance of local representations
for task-relevant objects offers a solution. By efficiently utilizing these
local representations, training and testing data can be mapped to a more
similar feature space, thereby mitigating the covariate shift problem.
Accordingly, we propose GLUE, a global-local unified encoding framework for
imitation learning based on key-patch tracking. GLUE selects and tracks
key-patches as critical local representations by employing a text-guided
mechanism. It features a novel fusion framework where global patch features
query local patches to distill essential information, yielding fine-grained
local features with low heterogeneity relative to the global context. This
fused representation steers the robot's visual attention toward task-relevant
objects and preserves precise global context, which together align the training
and testing distributions into a similar and task-informative feature space,
ultimately enhancing the robustness of the imitation learning policy.
Experiments demonstrate that GLUE achieves strong performance across diverse
tasks in both simulation and real-world settings, outperforming the strongest
baseline by 17.6% in simulation, 36.3% in real-world environments, and 58.3% on
real-world generalization settings. The project website of GLUE is available at

TL;DR: This paper proposes a switched policy framework for quadruped robots allowing adaptive force compliance and safe locomotion under external disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quadruped control methods lack adjustable compliance, making them prone to failure under large perturbations.

Method: A teacher-student reinforcement learning framework is used to train a compliant policy, with a capture point-based safe policy and a recoverability network for policy switching.

Result: The framework achieves force compliance and robust safety for quadrupeds against significant external disturbances.

Conclusion: The proposed approach equips quadruped robots with both tunable compliance and enhanced safety performance.

Abstract: Quadruped robots are designed to achieve agile locomotion by mimicking legged
animals. However, existing control methods for quadrupeds often lack one of the
key capabilities observed in animals: adaptive and adjustable compliance in
response to external disturbances. Most locomotion controllers do not provide
tunable compliance and tend to fail under large perturbations. In this work, we
propose a switched policy framework for compliant and safe quadruped
locomotion. First, we train a force compliant policy with adjustable compliance
levels using a teacher student reinforcement learning framework, eliminating
the need for explicit force sensing. Next, we develop a safe policy based on
the capture point concept to stabilize the robot when the compliant policy
fails. Finally, we introduce a recoverability network that predicts the
likelihood of failure and switches between the compliant and safe policies.
Together, this framework enables quadruped robots to achieve both force
compliance and robust safety when subjected to severe external disturbances.

### [1062] [Leave No Observation Behind: Real-time Correction for VLA Action Chunks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23224)
*Kohei Sendai,Maxime Alvarez,Tatsuya Matsushima,Yutaka Matsuo,Yusuke Iwasawa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces A2C2, a lightweight real-time correction mechanism to enhance action chunking in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, improving reactivity and robustness without retraining the base model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the trade-off in VLA models between efficiency (from action chunking) and reactivity, which is harmed under inference delays and long execution horizons.

Method: The A2C2 module adds a time-aware correction to VLA's predicted action chunks using the latest observation, the base action, positional features, and base policy features. It operates independently of the base policy, requiring no retraining, and is compatible with asynchronous execution schemes.

Result: A2C2 demonstrated consistent success rate improvements in the Kinetix task suite and LIBERO Spatial dataset (e.g., +23% with delays and +7% with extended horizons compared to Real Time Chunking), with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: A2C2 is an effective plug-in for enhancing real-time performance of high-capacity chunking policies, balancing competence and responsiveness efficiently.

Abstract: To improve efficiency and temporal coherence, Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models often predict action chunks; however, this action chunking harms
reactivity under inference delay and long horizons. We introduce Asynchronous
Action Chunk Correction (A2C2), which is a lightweight real-time chunk
correction head that runs every control step and adds a time-aware correction
to any off-the-shelf VLA's action chunk. The module combines the latest
observation, the predicted action from VLA (base action), a positional feature
that encodes the index of the base action within the chunk, and some features
from the base policy, then outputs a per-step correction. This preserves the
base model's competence while restoring closed-loop responsiveness. The
approach requires no retraining of the base policy and is orthogonal to
asynchronous execution schemes such as Real Time Chunking (RTC). On the dynamic
Kinetix task suite (12 tasks) and LIBERO Spatial, our method yields consistent
success rate improvements across increasing delays and execution horizons (+23%
point and +7% point respectively, compared to RTC), and also improves
robustness for long horizons even with zero injected delay. Since the
correction head is small and fast, there is minimal overhead compared to the
inference of large VLA models. These results indicate that A2C2 is an
effective, plug-in mechanism for deploying high-capacity chunking policies in
real-time control.

*Shamir Matan,Elhadad Osher,Nageris Ben,Mirsky Reuth*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This work introduces two open-source frameworks, gr-libs and gr-envs, to standardize and advance Goal Recognition tasks in Gym-compatible environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to resolve fragmentation issues in the Goal Recognition field caused by inconsistent benchmarks, domains, and evaluation methods.

Method: The authors propose gr-libs for modular implementations of GR baselines and diagnostics, and gr-envs for curated environments compatible with reinforcement learning tools.

Result: These libraries provide standardized tools and environments, allowing easier development, evaluation, and comparison of GR algorithms.

Conclusion: The two frameworks facilitate reproducible and extensible research in Goal Recognition, benefiting communities in fields like human-robot interaction and surveillance.

Abstract: Goal Recognition (GR) is the task of inferring an agent's intended goal from
partial observations of its behavior, typically in an online and one-shot
setting. Despite recent advances in model-free GR, particularly in applications
such as human-robot interaction, surveillance, and assistive systems, the field
remains fragmented due to inconsistencies in benchmarks, domains, and
evaluation protocols.
  To address this, we introduce gr-libs
(https://github.com/MatanShamir1/gr_libs) and gr-envs
(https://github.com/MatanShamir1/gr_envs), two complementary open-source
frameworks that support the development, evaluation, and comparison of GR
algorithms in Gym-compatible environments. gr-libs includes modular
implementations of MDP-based GR baselines, diagnostic tools, and evaluation
utilities. gr-envs provides a curated suite of environments adapted for dynamic
and goal-directed behavior, along with wrappers that ensure compatibility with
standard reinforcement learning toolkits. Together, these libraries offer a
standardized, extensible, and reproducible platform for advancing GR research.
Both packages are open-source and available on GitHub and PyPI.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: J-DAPT is a novel lightweight framework for multimodal jailbreak detection via attention-based fusion and domain adaptation, promising nearly 100% detection accuracy for virtual language models in robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns over the vulnerability of LLMs and VLMs to jailbreaking attacks in safety-critical robotic applications warrant effective defenses that overcome limitations like poor dataset generalization.

Method: J-DAPT employs attention-based fusion of textual and visual embeddings while aligning general-purpose jailbreak datasets with domain-specific reference data for improved detection.

Result: J-DAPT greatly enhances detection accuracy across diverse robotics domains, achieving nearly 100% success rate with minimal performance overhead.

Conclusion: J-DAPT stands out as a practical and effective tool to secure VLMs against vulnerabilities in robotic systems, substantially mitigating risks in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are
increasingly deployed in robotic environments but remain vulnerable to
jailbreaking attacks that bypass safety mechanisms and drive unsafe or
physically harmful behaviors in the real world. Data-driven defenses such as
jailbreak classifiers show promise, yet they struggle to generalize in domains
where specialized datasets are scarce, limiting their effectiveness in robotics
and other safety-critical contexts. To address this gap, we introduce J-DAPT, a
lightweight framework for multimodal jailbreak detection through
attention-based fusion and domain adaptation. J-DAPT integrates textual and
visual embeddings to capture both semantic intent and environmental grounding,
while aligning general-purpose jailbreak datasets with domain-specific
reference data. Evaluations across autonomous driving, maritime robotics, and
quadruped navigation show that J-DAPT boosts detection accuracy to nearly 100%
with minimal overhead. These results demonstrate that J-DAPT provides a
practical defense for securing VLMs in robotic applications. Additional

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel deterministic sampler for path planning in narrow passage environments, improving planning time and milestones while making the algorithm openly accessible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the common shortcomings of probabilistic methods in handling narrow passage environments during autonomous path planning.

Method: Developing a deterministic sampler using occupancy grid maps to concentrate sampling in narrow areas, with experiments conducted in simulation and real-world settings.

Result: The algorithm showed superior performance in planning time and number of milestones compared to baseline samplers.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances path planning efficiency in narrow passages and is made available as open-source for broader use.

Abstract: Autonomous technology, which has become widespread today, appears in many
different configurations such as mobile robots, manipulators, and drones. One
of the most important tasks of these vehicles during autonomous operations is
path planning. In the literature, path planners are generally divided into two
categories: probabilistic and deterministic methods. In the analysis of
probabilistic methods, the common problem of almost all methods is observed in
narrow passage environments. In this paper, a novel sampler is proposed that
deterministically identifies narrow passage environments using occupancy grid
maps and accordingly increases the amount of sampling in these regions. The
codes of the algorithm is provided as open source. To evaluate the performance
of the algorithm, benchmark studies are conducted in three distinct categories:
specific and random simulation environments, and a real-world environment. As a
result, it is observed that our algorithm provides higher performance in
planning time and number of milestones compared to the baseline samplers.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel motion planning framework for robot fleets that simultaneously addresses exploration, coverage, and target tracking in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was motivated by the challenge of deploying robots to explore unknown, non-convex environments while ensuring precise tracking and data collection of targets, especially in applications like rescue operations and environmental monitoring.

Method: The proposed method integrates three control strategies: frontier-based exploration, guaranteed coverage using Lloyd's algorithm, and sensor-based multi-target tracking. Simulations in MATLAB were utilized to validate the framework.

Result: The simulation results confirmed that the proposed algorithm is effective and superior to standard approaches in balancing exploration and active tracking.

Conclusion: The integrated framework successfully optimizes exploration, coverage, and tracking tasks, offering a viable solution for addressing challenges in complex robotic environments.

Abstract: In unknown non-convex environments, such as indoor and underground spaces,
deploying a fleet of robots to explore the surroundings while simultaneously
searching for and tracking targets of interest to maintain high-precision data
collection represents a fundamental challenge that urgently requires resolution
in applications such as environmental monitoring and rescue operations. Current
research has made significant progress in addressing environmental exploration,
information search, and target tracking problems, but has yet to establish a
framework for simultaneously optimizing these tasks in complex environments. In
this paper, we propose a novel motion planning algorithm framework that
integrates three control strategies: a frontier-based exploration strategy, a
guaranteed coverage strategy based on Lloyd's algorithm, and a sensor-based
multi-target tracking strategy. By incorporating these three strategies, the
proposed algorithm balances coverage search and high-precision active tracking
during exploration. Our approach is validated through a series of MATLAB
simulations, demonstrating validity and superiority over standard approaches.

Motivation: To find a balance between traditional control methods and advanced learning algorithms to achieve safe and efficient robotic applications.

Method: Combining reactive model predictive contouring control (RMPCC) with Iterative Closest Point (ICP) using active learning and probabilistic kernel optimization for uncertainty management.

Result: Experimental studies show the high performance of GUARD, indicating its potential and importance.

Conclusion: GUARD effectively addresses safety ambiguity in robotics and demonstrates potential for broader applications in future studies.

Abstract: This paper presents the framework \textbf{GUARD} (\textbf{G}uided robot
control via \textbf{U}ncertainty attribution and prob\textbf{A}bilistic kernel
optimization for \textbf{R}isk-aware \textbf{D}ecision making) that combines
traditional control with an uncertainty-aware perception technique using active
learning with real-time capability for safe robot collision avoidance. By doing
so, this manuscript addresses the central challenge in robotics of finding a
reasonable compromise between traditional methods and learning algorithms to
foster the development of safe, yet efficient and flexible applications. By
unifying a reactive model predictive countouring control (RMPCC) with an
Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm that enables the attribution of
uncertainty sources online using active learning with real-time capability via
a probabilistic kernel optimization technique, \emph{GUARD} inherently handles
the existing ambiguity of the term \textit{safety} that exists in robotics
literature. Experimental studies indicate the high performance of \emph{GUARD},

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust autonomous systems in space exploration faces challenges due to high costs and limited data; the framework is designed to bridge these gaps.

Method: The framework integrates procedural generation, parallel simulations, and benchmark tasks, using reinforcement learning to establish baselines and assess various challenges.

Result: Performance baselines are established, and the utility of the framework in managing generalization, adaptive control, and sim-to-real transfer is demonstrated.

Conclusion: The Space Robotics Bench provides a valuable tool for advancing autonomous system development for space robotics.

Abstract: The growing ambition for space exploration demands robust autonomous systems
that can operate in unstructured environments under extreme extraterrestrial
conditions. The adoption of robot learning in this domain is severely hindered
by the prohibitive cost of technology demonstrations and the limited
availability of data. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Space Robotics
Bench, an open-source simulation framework for robot learning in space. It
offers a modular architecture that integrates on-demand procedural generation
with massively parallel simulation environments to support the creation of vast
and diverse training distributions for learning-based agents. To ground
research and enable direct comparison, the framework includes a comprehensive
suite of benchmark tasks that span a wide range of mission-relevant scenarios.
We establish performance baselines using standard reinforcement learning
algorithms and present a series of experimental case studies that investigate
key challenges in generalization, end-to-end learning, adaptive control, and
sim-to-real transfer. Our results reveal insights into the limitations of
current methods and demonstrate the utility of the framework in producing
policies capable of real-world operation. These contributions establish the
Space Robotics Bench as a valuable resource for developing, benchmarking, and

TL;DR: The paper improves the Manifold EKF by incorporating TRIAD's mechanisms to reduce magnetometer disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In attitude determination using the Manifold EKF, magnetometers are prone to disturbances, requiring methods to mitigate such errors.

Method: The TRIAD algorithm's sub-optimal property is integrated into the pitch and roll axis determination of the Manifold EKF.

Result: The modified algorithm mitigates magnetometer reading disturbances, as shown through experimental results.

Conclusion: Incorporating TRIAD into the Manifold EKF enhances its robustness against magnetometer disturbances.

Abstract: The manifold extended Kalman filter (Manifold EKF) has found extensive
application for attitude determination. Magnetometers employed as sensors for
such attitude determination are easily prone to disturbances by their
sensitivity to calibration and external magnetic fields. The TRIAD (Tri-Axial
Attitude Determination) algorithm is well known as a sub-optimal attitude
estimator. In this article, we incorporate this sub-optimal feature of the
TRIAD in mitigating the influence of the magnetometer reading in the pitch and
roll axis determination in the Manifold EKF algorithm. We substantiate our
results with experiments.

*Haonan Chen,Jiaming Xu,Hongyu Chen,Kaiwen Hong,Binghao Huang,Chaoqi Liu,Jiayuan Mao,Yunzhu Li,Yilun Du,Katherine Driggs-Campbell*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using modular diffusion models and adaptive networks for better integrating diverse sensory modalities in robotic manipulation, solving issues like dominant signal bias and flexible modality inclusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the integration of diverse sensory modalities for robotic manipulation, overcoming challenges like dominance of certain signals (e.g., vision over touch) and the lack of flexibility in traditional models to adapt to new or missing modalities.

Method: The approach factorizes the policy into multiple specialized diffusion models (one per sensory representation, such as vision or touch) and uses a router network with consensus weights to flexibly combine these models. This allows for incremental integration of new modalities.

Result: In both simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, including complex scenarios like occluded object picking and puzzle insertion, the method outperformed traditional feature-concatenation models. It showed robustness to physical disturbances and sensor corruption.

Conclusion: The proposed modular approach effectively combines multimodal sensory data, improving performance and adaptability in robotic manipulation tasks, and shifts modality importance dynamically based on task needs.

Abstract: Effectively integrating diverse sensory modalities is crucial for robotic
manipulation. However, the typical approach of feature concatenation is often
suboptimal: dominant modalities such as vision can overwhelm sparse but
critical signals like touch in contact-rich tasks, and monolithic architectures
cannot flexibly incorporate new or missing modalities without retraining. Our
method factorizes the policy into a set of diffusion models, each specialized
for a single representation (e.g., vision or touch), and employs a router
network that learns consensus weights to adaptively combine their
contributions, enabling incremental of new representations. We evaluate our
approach on simulated manipulation tasks in {RLBench}, as well as real-world
tasks such as occluded object picking, in-hand spoon reorientation, and puzzle
insertion, where it significantly outperforms feature-concatenation baselines
on scenarios requiring multimodal reasoning. Our policy further demonstrates
robustness to physical perturbations and sensor corruption. We further conduct
perturbation-based importance analysis, which reveals adaptive shifts between
modalities.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a decentralized framework for conflict resolution in heterogeneous robot teams using LLMs for help requests and STL-based reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing deployment of robots, especially in warehousing, highlights the need for efficient collaboration in resolving unforeseen conflicts among diverse robot teams.

Method: The framework combines decentralized decision-making, natural language-based help requests, LLM reasoning grounded in STL using BNF grammar, and MILP optimization for task conflict resolution.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method minimizes system-level task completion time and outperforms heuristics like nearest helper selection, achieving results comparable to centralized baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively resolves robot team conflicts with decentralized methods and reduced information demands compared to centralized approaches.

Abstract: Increased robot deployment, such as in warehousing, has revealed a need for
seamless collaboration among heterogeneous robot teams to resolve unforeseen
conflicts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel decentralized
framework that enables robots to request and provide help. The process begins
when a robot detects a conflict and uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to decide
whether external assistance is required. If so, it crafts and broadcasts a
natural language (NL) help request. Potential helper robots reason over the
request and respond with offers of assistance, including information about the
effect on their ongoing tasks. Helper reasoning is implemented via an LLM
grounded in Signal Temporal Logic (STL) using a Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar,
ensuring syntactically valid NL-to-STL translations, which are then solved as a
Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). Finally, the requester robot selects a
helper by reasoning over the expected increase in system-level total task
completion time. We evaluated our framework through experiments comparing
different helper-selection strategies and found that considering multiple
offers allows the requester to minimize added makespan. Our approach
significantly outperforms heuristics such as selecting the nearest available
candidate helper robot, and achieves performance comparable to a centralized
"Oracle" baseline but without heavy information demands.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores whole-body manipulation using two soft continuum arms, introducing a simulation method that transfers learned manipulation policy to real hardware with high success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robotic manipulation of large, heavy, or awkward objects using soft robots while addressing the inherent challenges posed by uncertainties in their kinematics and dynamics.

Method: Developed a high-speed simulation in MuJoCo (running up to 350x real time) for testing manipulation policies and guided reinforcement learning with motion primitives for policy optimization.

Result: Achieved an 88% success rate on the Baloo hardware platform with zero-shot sim-to-real policy transfer for whole-body manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of using soft robots for whole-body manipulation tasks, leveraging simulation and RL-guided approaches to overcome dynamics uncertainty and optimize learned policies.

Abstract: Whole-body manipulation is a powerful yet underexplored approach that enables
robots to interact with large, heavy, or awkward objects using more than just
their end-effectors. Soft robots, with their inherent passive compliance, are
particularly well-suited for such contact-rich manipulation tasks, but their
uncertainties in kinematics and dynamics pose significant challenges for
simulation and control. In this work, we address this challenge with a
simulation that can run up to 350x real time on a single thread in MuJoCo and
provide a detailed analysis of the critical tradeoffs between speed and
accuracy for this simulation. Using this framework, we demonstrate a successful
zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of a learned whole-body manipulation policy,
achieving an 88% success rate on the Baloo hardware platform. We show that
guiding RL with a simple motion primitive is critical to this success where
standard reward shaping methods struggled to produce a stable and successful
policy for whole-body manipulation. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the
learned policy does not simply mimic the motion primitive. It exhibits
beneficial reactive behavior, such as re-grasping and perturbation recovery. We
analyze and contrast this learned policy against an open-loop baseline to show
that the policy can also exhibit aggressive over-corrections under
perturbation. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of forceful,
six-DoF whole-body manipulation using two continuum soft arms on a large-scale
platform (10 kg payloads), with zero-shot policy transfer.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a compact axial-flux permanent-magnet (AFPM) motor designed using PCB windings with high-density interconnect (HDI) technology for better torque and reduced resistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quasi-direct-drive (QDD) actuators need motors that can deliver high torque at low speeds within small, disc-shaped designs, but conventional AFPM motors are limited by poor copper fill at smaller scales.

Method: The authors designed a micro-scale AFPM motor with PCB windings using advanced IC-substrate HDI technology, resulting in a stator made of 48 layers to achieve higher copper fill. They performed electromagnetic and thermal analysis and fabricated a prototype for validation.

Result: The prototype motor achieved a record 45% copper fill, had a 5mm thickness and 19mm diameter, and its performance was experimentally verified.

Conclusion: The use of HDI-enabled PCB windings successfully enhanced the motor's design, allowing for efficient, compact, and high-torque actuation suited for robotics applications.

Abstract: Quasi-direct-drive (QDD) actuation is transforming legged and manipulator
robots by eliminating high-ratio gearboxes, yet it demands motors that deliver
very high torque at low speed within a thin, disc-shaped joint envelope.
Axial-flux permanent-magnet (AFPM) machines meet these geometric and torque
requirements, but scaling them below a 20mm outer diameter is hampered by poor
copper fill in conventional wound stators, inflating resistance and throttling
continuous torque. This paper introduces a micro-scale AFPM motor that
overcomes these limitations through printed-circuit-board (PCB) windings
fabricated with advanced IC-substrate high-density interconnect (HDI)
technology. The resulting 48-layer stator-formed by stacking four 12-layer HDI
modules-achieves a record 45\% copper fill in a package only 5mm thick and 19mm
in diameter. We perform comprehensive electromagnetic and thermal analyses to
inform the motor design, then fabricate a prototype whose performance
characteristics are experimentally verified.

TL;DR: RAVEN is a framework for aerial semantic navigation in unstructured outdoor environments, outperforming baselines by 85.25% and demonstrating real-world potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of exploring large, unstructured outdoor environments for semantic navigation, something current indoor and outdoor methods struggle with due to their spatial or adaptability limitations.

Method: The method includes a 3D memory-based system that incorporates a voxel-ray map for persistent memory, short- and long-range search strategies, and a vision-language model for auxiliary cues, all orchestrated by a behavior tree.

Result: RAVEN significantly outperformed baselines in simulation by 85.25% across various semantic tasks and showed effectiveness in real-world field tests on aerial robots.

Conclusion: RAVEN provides a robust and scalable approach to outdoor semantic navigation, addressing the limitations of both reactive and precomputed offline methods.

Abstract: Aerial outdoor semantic navigation requires robots to explore large,
unstructured environments to locate target objects. Recent advances in semantic
navigation have demonstrated open-set object-goal navigation in indoor
settings, but these methods remain limited by constrained spatial ranges and
structured layouts, making them unsuitable for long-range outdoor search. While
outdoor semantic navigation approaches exist, they either rely on reactive
policies based on current observations, which tend to produce short-sighted
behaviors, or precompute scene graphs offline for navigation, limiting
adaptability to online deployment. We present RAVEN, a 3D memory-based,
behavior tree framework for aerial semantic navigation in unstructured outdoor
environments. It (1) uses a spatially consistent semantic voxel-ray map as
persistent memory, enabling long-horizon planning and avoiding purely reactive
behaviors, (2) combines short-range voxel search and long-range ray search to
scale to large environments, (3) leverages a large vision-language model to
suggest auxiliary cues, mitigating sparsity of outdoor targets. These
components are coordinated by a behavior tree, which adaptively switches
behaviors for robust operation. We evaluate RAVEN in 10 photorealistic outdoor
simulation environments over 100 semantic tasks, encompassing single-object
search, multi-class, multi-instance navigation and sequential task changes.
Results show RAVEN outperforms baselines by 85.25% in simulation and
demonstrate its real-world applicability through deployment on an aerial robot
in outdoor field tests.

Motivation: To address the unnatural grasp behaviors often produced by grasp priors in existing robotics reinforcement learning methods.

Method: A dataset of pre-grasp and grasp strategies for 773 objects was created, with geometry-based clustering for shape-based expert selection in a two-stage process.

Result: Achieved a high grasp success rate of 99.4% on training data and 96.3% on test data, demonstrating adaptability and generalization.

Conclusion: The approach enables natural, human-like dexterous grasping with strong effectiveness and generalization across diverse object shapes and categories.

Abstract: Robust and human-like dexterous grasping of general objects is a critical
capability for advancing intelligent robotic manipulation in real-world
scenarios. However, existing reinforcement learning methods guided by grasp
priors often result in unnatural behaviors. In this work, we present
\textit{ContactGrasp}, a robotic dexterous pre-grasp and grasp dataset that
explicitly accounts for task-relevant wrist orientation and thumb-index
pinching coordination. The dataset covers 773 objects in 82 categories,
providing a rich foundation for training human-like grasp strategies. Building
upon this dataset, we perform geometry-based clustering to group objects by
shape, enabling a two-stage Geometry-based Expert Selection (GES) framework
that selects among specialized experts for grasping diverse object geometries,
thereby enhancing adaptability to diverse shapes and generalization across
categories. Our approach demonstrates natural grasp postures and achieves high
success rates of 99.4\% and 96.3\% on the train and test sets, respectively,
showcasing strong generalization and high-quality grasp execution.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLAP, a coarse-to-fine policy framework incorporating task decomposition, VLM fine-tuning, and 3D-aware representations, excelling at generalization in robotic 3D manipulation with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical coarse-to-fine policies are effective in robotic manipulation for precise actions and sample efficiency. However, generalization to new environments and instructions remains a challenge.

Method: The proposed CLAP framework integrates three components: task decomposition, fine-tuning visual-language models (VLM) for 3D keypoint prediction, and using 3D-aware representations.

Result: On the GemBench benchmark, CLAP achieves a 12% higher success rate than the current state-of-the-art while using only 20% of the training data. Additionally, it successfully generalizes in real-world experiments with limited demonstrations.

Conclusion: CLAP significantly enhances generalization in robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating superior performance both in simulations and real-world settings with minimal training data and resources.

Abstract: Hierarchical coarse-to-fine policy, where a coarse branch predicts a region
of interest to guide a fine-grained action predictor, has demonstrated
significant potential in robotic 3D manipulation tasks by especially enhancing
sample efficiency and enabling more precise manipulation. However, even
augmented with pre-trained models, these hierarchical policies still suffer
from generalization issues. To enhance generalization to novel instructions and
environment variations, we propose Coarse-to-fine Language-Aligned manipulation
Policy (CLAP), a framework that integrates three key components: 1) task
decomposition, 2) VLM fine-tuning for 3D keypoint prediction, and 3) 3D-aware
representation. Through comprehensive experiments in simulation and on a real
robot, we demonstrate its superior generalization capability. Specifically, on
GemBench, a benchmark designed for evaluating generalization, our approach
achieves a 12\% higher average success rate than the SOTA method while using
only 1/5 of the training trajectories. In real-world experiments, our policy,
trained on only 10 demonstrations, successfully generalizes to novel
instructions and environments.

### [1077] [Encoding Material Safety using Control Barrier Functions for Soft Actuator Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23623)
*Nicholas Pagliocca,Behrad Koohbor,Mitja Trkov*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper formally defines safety for soft robots based on strain energy functions and presents a controller to enforce material safety, using high-order control barrier functions (HOCBF) validated through simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of formalization surrounding soft robot safety, particularly as advancements in feedback control make such considerations critical.

Method: The study uses a formal framework with strain energy functions to characterize safe/unsafe states of hyperelastic materials. It implements a quadratic program-based high-order control barrier function (HOCBF) for material safety enforcement.

Result: Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed HOCBF controller in ensuring material safety in a pressurized hyperelastic tube with incorporated dynamics.

Conclusion: The methodology introduced successfully formalizes and enforces the concept of material safety in soft robotic systems, paving the way for safer design and operation of such robots.

Abstract: Until recently, the concept of soft robot safety was an informal notion,
often attributed solely to the fact that soft robots are less likely to damage
their operating environment than rigid robots. As the field moves toward
feedback control for practical applications, it becomes increasingly important
to define what safety means and to characterize how soft robots can become
unsafe. The unifying theme of soft robotics is to achieve useful functionality
through deformation. Consequently, limitations in constitutive model accuracy
and risks of material failure are inherent to all soft robots and pose a key
challenge in designing provably safe controllers. This work introduces a formal
definition of material safety based on strain energy functions and provides a
controller that enforces it. We characterize safe and unsafe sets of an
incompressible hyperelastic material and demonstrate that safety can be
enforced using a high-order control barrier function (HOCBF) with quadratic
program-based feedback control. As a case study, we consider a pressurized
hyperelastic tube with inertial effects, first-order viscous effects, and
full-state feedback. Simulation results verify that the proposed methodology
can enforce the material safety specification.

### [1078] [KiVi: Kinesthetic-Visuospatial Integration for Dynamic and Safe Egocentric Legged Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23650)
*Peizhuo Li,Hongyi Li,Yuxuan Ma,Linnan Chang,Xinrong Yang,Ruiqi Yu,Yifeng Zhang,Yuhong Cao,Qiuguo Zhu,Guillaume Sartoretti*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces KiVi, a sensorimotor framework integrating kinesthetic and visuospatial pathways for legged robots to robustly adapt to complex terrains and visual disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legged robots face instability in locomotion due to the fragility of visual information, which is susceptible to occlusions, reflections, and lighting changes.

Method: KiVi employs a dual-pathway design: proprioception as a stable core for sensing body motion, and visuospatial reasoning for terrain awareness and obstacle avoidance. It uses memory-enhanced attention for modality integration.

Result: KiVi demonstrated reliable and robust performance in diverse terrains and unstructured outdoor settings, proving resistance to out-of-distribution visual noise and occlusions unseen during training.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enhances stability and adaptability in legged robot locomotion, establishing its relevance for real-world applications.

Abstract: Vision-based locomotion has shown great promise in enabling legged robots to
perceive and adapt to complex environments. However, visual information is
inherently fragile, being vulnerable to occlusions, reflections, and lighting
changes, which often cause instability in locomotion. Inspired by animal
sensorimotor integration, we propose KiVi, a Kinesthetic-Visuospatial
integration framework, where kinesthetics encodes proprioceptive sensing of
body motion and visuospatial reasoning captures visual perception of
surrounding terrain. Specifically, KiVi separates these pathways, leveraging
proprioception as a stable backbone while selectively incorporating vision for
terrain awareness and obstacle avoidance. This modality-balanced, yet
integrative design, combined with memory-enhanced attention, allows the robot
to robustly interpret visual cues while maintaining fallback stability through
proprioception. Extensive experiments show that our method enables quadruped
robots to stably traverse diverse terrains and operate reliably in unstructured
outdoor environments, remaining robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) visual
noise and occlusion unseen during training, thereby highlighting its
effectiveness and applicability to real-world legged locomotion.

### [1079] [HeLoM: Hierarchical Learning for Whole-Body Loco-Manipulation in Hexapod Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23651)
*Xinrong Yang,Peizhuo Li,Hongyi Li,Junkai Lu,Linnan Chang,Yuhong Cao,Yifeng Zhang,Ge Sun,Guillaume Sartoretti*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces HeLoM, a hierarchical learning-based framework for hexapod robots to push heavy or irregular objects stably and efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable robots in real-world environments to manipulate heavy or irregular objects effectively through pushing, which is simpler than grasping and carrying but requires stability and sufficient force.

Method: The method is a hierarchical whole-body manipulation framework (HeLoM) that uses a high-level planner and low-level controller for coordinated multi-limb pushing by hexapod robots. Training is done in simulation and directly applied to real robots.

Result: Results from simulation and real-world experiments validate that HeLoM allows the robot to stably push boxes of varying sizes and unknown properties to target positions.

Conclusion: The HeLoM framework successfully enables hexapod robots to handle pushing tasks dynamically and robustly, showing its potential in practical applications.

Abstract: Robots in real-world environments are often required to move/manipulate
objects comparable in weight to their own bodies. Compared to grasping and
carrying, pushing provides a more straightforward and efficient non-prehensile
manipulation strategy, avoiding complex grasp design while leveraging direct
contact to regulate an object's pose. Achieving effective pushing, however,
demands both sufficient manipulation forces and the ability to maintain
stability, which is particularly challenging when dealing with heavy or
irregular objects. To address these challenges, we propose HeLoM, a
learning-based hierarchical whole-body manipulation framework for a hexapod
robot that exploits coordinated multi-limb control. Inspired by the cooperative
strategies of multi-legged insects, our framework leverages redundant contact
points and high degrees of freedom to enable dynamic redistribution of contact
forces. HeLoM's high-level planner plans pushing behaviors and target object
poses, while its low-level controller maintains locomotion stability and
generates dynamically consistent joint actions. Our policies trained in
simulation are directly deployed on real robots without additional fine-tuning.
This design allows the robot to maintain balance while exerting continuous and
controllable pushing forces through coordinated foreleg interaction and
supportive hind-leg propulsion. We validate the effectiveness of HeLoM through
both simulation and real-world experiments. Results show that our framework can
stably push boxes of varying sizes and unknown physical properties to
designated goal poses in the real world.

### [1080] [Focusing on What Matters: Object-Agent-centric Tokenization for Vision Language Action models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23655)
*Rokas Bendikas,Daniel Dijkman,Markus Peschl,Sanjay Haresh,Pietro Mazzaglia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Oat-VLA, an efficient tokenization method for Vision-Language-Action models, focusing on robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high computational costs of adapting Vision-Language-Models (VLMs) for robotic domains due to inefficient tokenization of visual inputs.

Method: The authors propose Oat-VLA, which incorporates an object-agent-centric tokenization based on principles of object-centric representation learning, prioritizing scene objects and the agent's visual information.

Result: Oat-VLA significantly reduces the number of visual tokens while maintaining performance, converges twice as fast as OpenVLA on the LIBERO suite, and excels in diverse real-world pick-and-place tasks.

Conclusion: The findings illustrate that Oat-VLA optimizes efficiency while retaining effectiveness, presenting a scalable solution for VLA training in robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a pivotal approach to learning
robotic manipulation at scale by repurposing large pre-trained
Vision-Language-Models (VLM) to output robotic actions. However, adapting VLMs
for robotic domains comes with an unnecessarily high computational cost, which
we attribute to the tokenization scheme of visual inputs. In this work, we aim
to enable efficient VLA training by proposing Oat-VLA, an Object-Agent-centric
Tokenization for VLAs. Building on the insights of object-centric
representation learning, our method introduces an inductive bias towards scene
objects and the agent's own visual information. As a result, we find that
Oat-VLA can drastically reduce the number of visual tokens to just a few tokens
without sacrificing performance. We reveal that Oat-VLA converges at least
twice as fast as OpenVLA on the LIBERO suite, as well as outperform OpenVLA in
diverse real-world pick and place tasks.

### [1081] [Certifiably Optimal State Estimation and Robot Calibration Using Trace-Constrained SDP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23656)
*Liangting Wu,Roberto Tron*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a trace-constrained SDP framework for solving robotics problems, improving global optimality by recovering rank-1 solutions through novel methods and refinements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the rank-1 matrix challenge in SDP formulations for robotics problems, which is crucial for practical solution quality.

Method: Proposed trace-constrained SDPs with positive semidefinite decision variables and fixed trace values, customized fixed-trace variables, and a gradient-based refinement to project solutions toward rank-1 matrices.

Result: Demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework in simulations for robotics tasks like PnP estimation, hand-eye calibration, and dual-robot system calibration.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a robust method for achieving globally optimal solutions in robotics tasks, supported by modular modeling for broader applicability.

Abstract: Many nonconvex problems in robotics can be relaxed into convex formulations
via semidefinite programming (SDP), which offers the advantage of global
optimality. The practical quality of these solutions, however, critically
depends on achieving rank-1 matrices, a condition that typically requires
additional tightening. In this work, we focus on trace-constrained SDPs, where
the decision variables are positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices with fixed
trace values. These additional constraints not only capture important
structural properties but also facilitate first-order methods for recovering
rank-1 solutions. We introduce customized fixed-trace variables and constraints
to represent common robotic quantities such as rotations and translations,
which can be exactly recovered when the corresponding variables are rank-1. To
further improve practical performance, we develop a gradient-based refinement
procedure that projects relaxed SDP solutions toward rank-1, low-cost
candidates, which can then be certified for global optimality via the dual
problem. We demonstrate that many robotics tasks can be expressed within this
trace-constrained SDP framework, and showcase its effectiveness through
simulations in perspective-n-point (PnP) estimation, hand-eye calibration, and
dual-robot system calibration. To support broader use, we also introduce a
modular ``virtual robot'' abstraction that simplifies modeling across different
problem settings.

*Jun Chen,Mingjia Chen,Shinkyu Park*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a dynamic algorithm for multi-robot coverage path planning, addressing workload imbalances caused by fixed velocity assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional MCPP methods lead to inefficiencies due to fixed velocity assumptions, causing unbalanced workloads and increased task completion times.

Method: The paper introduces MDCPP, which dynamically estimates robot workloads using Gaussian mixture models and divides coverage using capacity-constrained Voronoi diagrams. It also provides a distributed implementation for constrained robotic networks.

Result: Simulations validate MDCPP's superior performance and highlight communication range's impact on efficiency.

Conclusion: MDCPP improves coverage balance and task efficiency, proving effective compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Multi-robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP) addresses the problem of computing
paths for multiple robots to effectively cover a large area of interest.
Conventional approaches to MCPP typically assume that robots move at fixed
velocities, which is often unrealistic in real-world applications where robots
must adapt their speeds based on the specific coverage tasks assigned to
them.Consequently, conventional approaches often lead to imbalanced workload
distribution among robots and increased completion time for coverage tasks. To
address this, we introduce a novel Multi-robot Dynamic Coverage Path Planning
(MDCPP) algorithm for complete coverage in two-dimensional environments. MDCPP
dynamically estimates each robot's remaining workload by approximating the
target distribution with Gaussian mixture models, and assigns coverage regions
using a capacity-constrained Voronoi diagram. We further develop a distributed
implementation of MDCPP for range-constrained robotic networks. Simulation
results validate the efficacy of MDCPP, showing qualitative improvements and
superior performance compared to an existing sweeping algorithm, and a
quantifiable impact of communication range on coverage efficiency.

*Chi Chu,Huazhe Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel motion generation framework, DA-MMP, designed to improve robot dynamic manipulation tasks such as ring tossing, by learning execution dynamics and overcoming the shortcomings of predefined motion planning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for dynamic robot manipulation often rely on manually designed action parameterizations, which limit the capability to perform complex and coordinated motions. Motion planning methods face challenges due to inaccuracies arising from dynamics gaps such as control issues and contact uncertainties.

Method: The authors propose DA-MMP, a framework extending motion manifold primitives to variable-length trajectories, coupled with a compact parametrization. They leverage large-scale datasets to learn a high-quality motion manifold and train a conditional flow matching model in the latent space using real-world trials.

Result: Their approach generates coordinated and smooth trajectories for a challenging ring-tossing task. Real-world evaluations show high success rates, surpassing human experts, while also demonstrating generalization to novel targets beyond training scenarios.

Conclusion: The DA-MMP framework effectively learns the trajectory-dynamics mapping, offering an improved and versatile solution for dynamic manipulation tasks, and setting a new benchmark in robotic performance.

Abstract: Dynamic manipulation is a key capability for advancing robot performance,
enabling skills such as tossing. While recent learning-based approaches have
pushed the field forward, most methods still rely on manually designed action
parameterizations, limiting their ability to produce the highly coordinated
motions required in complex tasks. Motion planning can generate feasible
trajectories, but the dynamics gap-stemming from control inaccuracies, contact
uncertainties, and aerodynamic effects-often causes large deviations between
planned and executed trajectories. In this work, we propose Dynamics-Aware
Motion Manifold Primitives (DA-MMP), a motion generation framework for
goal-conditioned dynamic manipulation, and instantiate it on a challenging
real-world ring-tossing task. Our approach extends motion manifold primitives
to variable-length trajectories through a compact parametrization and learns a
high-quality manifold from a large-scale dataset of planned motions. Building
on this manifold, a conditional flow matching model is trained in the latent
space with a small set of real-world trials, enabling the generation of
throwing trajectories that account for execution dynamics. Experiments show
that our method can generate coordinated and smooth motion trajectories for the
ring-tossing task. In real-world evaluations, it achieves high success rates
and even surpasses the performance of trained human experts. Moreover, it
generalizes to novel targets beyond the training range, indicating that it
successfully learns the underlying trajectory-dynamics mapping.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LocoFormer is a generalist locomotion controller for legged and wheeled robots, adaptable to unseen morphologies and dynamics changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the need for manually tuning locomotion controllers for specific robots and ensure adaptability to a wide range of embodiments.

Method: Using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) trained on procedurally generated robots with aggressive domain randomization, and introducing policies with extended context spans that include inter-episode learning.

Result: LocoFormer demonstrated robust control across various robots and adapted to dynamic changes, including weight alterations and motor failures, showing emergent learning from falls over episodes.

Conclusion: LocoFormer's approach offers a scalable and general framework for training foundation models in robotic skills, with potential for wide applications in robotics.

Abstract: Modern locomotion controllers are manually tuned for specific embodiments. We
present LocoFormer, a generalist omni-bodied locomotion model that can control
previously unseen legged and wheeled robots, even without precise knowledge of
their kinematics. LocoFormer is able to adapt to changes in morphology and
dynamics at test time. We find that two key choices enable adaptation. First,
we train massive scale RL on procedurally generated robots with aggressive
domain randomization. Second, in contrast to previous policies that are myopic
with short context lengths, we extend context by orders of magnitude to span
episode boundaries. We deploy the same LocoFormer to varied robots and show
robust control even with large disturbances such as weight change and motor
failures. In extreme scenarios, we see emergent adaptation across episodes,
LocoFormer learns from falls in early episodes to improve control strategies in
later ones. We believe that this simple, yet general recipe can be used to
train foundation models for other robotic skills in the future. Videos at

*Zeyuan Zhang,Chaoran Li,Shao Zhang,Ying Wen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SePar, a novel method using Transformer-based sequence modeling, enhances performance and computational efficiency in Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in learning-based MAPD approaches, especially in challenging warehouse-like environments with narrow pathways.

Method: The paper formulates MAPF as a sequence modeling problem and introduces Sequential Pathfinder (SePar), leveraging the Transformer paradigm for implicit information exchange and linear decision-making complexity.

Result: SePar consistently outperforms existing approaches in various MAPF tasks and generalizes effectively to new environments.

Conclusion: Integrating imitation learning is crucial for handling complex maps, while SePar provides a scalable and efficient solution for MAPD challenges.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery (MAPD) is a challenging extension of
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), where agents are required to sequentially
complete tasks with fixed-location pickup and delivery demands. Although
learning-based methods have made progress in MAPD, they often perform poorly in
warehouse-like environments with narrow pathways and long corridors when
relying only on local observations for distributed decision-making.
Communication learning can alleviate the lack of global information but
introduce high computational complexity due to point-to-point communication. To
address this challenge, we formulate MAPF as a sequence modeling problem and
prove that path-finding policies under sequence modeling possess
order-invariant optimality, ensuring its effectiveness in MAPD. Building on
this, we propose the Sequential Pathfinder (SePar), which leverages the
Transformer paradigm to achieve implicit information exchange, reducing
decision-making complexity from exponential to linear while maintaining
efficiency and global awareness. Experiments demonstrate that SePar
consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods across various MAPF
tasks and their variants, and generalizes well to unseen environments.
Furthermore, we highlight the necessity of integrating imitation learning in
complex maps like warehouses.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the localization accuracy and robustness of climbing robots operating in challenging environments, effectively addressing limitations of traditional single-sensor systems.

Abstract: To address the need for high-precision localization of climbing robots in
complex high-altitude environments, this paper proposes a multi-sensor fusion
system that overcomes the limitations of single-sensor approaches. Firstly, the
localization scenarios and the problem model are analyzed. An integrated
architecture of Attention Mechanism-based Fusion Algorithm (AMFA) incorporating
planar array Ultra-Wideband (UWB), GPS, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and
barometer is designed to handle challenges such as GPS occlusion and UWB
Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) problem. Then, End-to-end neural network inference
models for UWB and barometer are developed, along with a multimodal attention
mechanism for adaptive data fusion. An Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is applied
to refine the trajectory, improving accuracy and robustness. Finally,
real-world experiments show that the method achieves 0.48 m localization

TL;DR: DexFlyWheel presents a scalable and iterative data generation framework for robotic dexterous manipulation, advancing policy performance in diverse and real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for generating datasets for robotic dexterous manipulation are either labor-intensive or lack diversity, limiting scalability and generalization.

Method: DexFlyWheel uses an iterative self-improving cycle that integrates Imitation Learning, residual Reinforcement Learning, simulation trajectory generation, and data augmentation to expand dataset diversity.

Result: DexFlyWheel successfully generated over 2,000 demonstrations for four challenging tasks. Policies trained on this dataset achieved an 81.9% success rate on test sets and a 78.3% success rate for real-world dual-arm lift tasks using a digital twin.

Conclusion: The proposed framework produces diverse and high-quality datasets, significantly improving the scalability, generalization, and real-world applicability of robotic dexterous manipulation policies.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation is critical for advancing robot capabilities in
real-world applications, yet diverse and high-quality datasets remain scarce.
Existing data collection methods either rely on human teleoperation or require
significant human engineering, or generate data with limited diversity, which
restricts their scalability and generalization. In this paper, we introduce
DexFlyWheel, a scalable data generation framework that employs a self-improving
cycle to continuously enrich data diversity. Starting from efficient seed
demonstrations warmup, DexFlyWheel expands the dataset through iterative
cycles. Each cycle follows a closed-loop pipeline that integrates Imitation
Learning (IL), residual Reinforcement Learning (RL), rollout trajectory
collection, and data augmentation. Specifically, IL extracts human-like
behaviors from demonstrations, and residual RL enhances policy generalization.
The learned policy is then used to generate trajectories in simulation, which
are further augmented across diverse environments and spatial configurations
before being fed back into the next cycle. Over successive iterations, a
self-improving data flywheel effect emerges, producing datasets that cover
diverse scenarios and thereby scaling policy performance. Experimental results
demonstrate that DexFlyWheel generates over 2,000 diverse demonstrations across
four challenging tasks. Policies trained on our dataset achieve an average
success rate of 81.9\% on the challenge test sets and successfully transfer to
the real world through digital twin, achieving a 78.3\% success rate on

TL;DR: MAD-PINN is a decentralized framework for large-scale multi-agent systems that combines physics-informed neural networks and epigraph reformulation to optimize safety and performance in scalable ways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of optimizing both safety and performance in large-scale multi-agent systems, which existing methods fail to solve due to lack of safety guarantees, conservatism, or scalability issues.

Method: The paper introduces MAD-PINN, leveraging a physics-informed neural network, epigraph-based reformulation, decentralized implementation, Hamilton-Jacobi reachability for safety-critical interactions, and a receding-horizon policy to ensure scalability and adaptability.

Result: MAD-PINN achieves superior safety and performance trade-offs, scales effectively with increasing agent numbers, and outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in multi-agent navigation tasks.

Conclusion: MAD-PINN is a robust framework that balances safety and performance in large-scale multi-agent systems, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness in outperforming existing techniques.

Abstract: Co-optimizing safety and performance in large-scale multi-agent systems
remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches based on multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL), safety filtering, or Model Predictive Control
(MPC) either lack strict safety guarantees, suffer from conservatism, or fail
to scale effectively. We propose MAD-PINN, a decentralized physics-informed
machine learning framework for solving the multi-agent state-constrained
optimal control problem (MASC-OCP). Our method leverages an epigraph-based
reformulation of SC-OCP to simultaneously capture performance and safety, and
approximates its solution via a physics-informed neural network. Scalability is
achieved by training the SC-OCP value function on reduced-agent systems and
deploying them in a decentralized fashion, where each agent relies only on
local observations of its neighbours for decision-making. To further enhance
safety and efficiency, we introduce an Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based
neighbour selection strategy to prioritize safety-critical interactions, and a
receding-horizon policy execution scheme that adapts to dynamic interactions
while reducing computational burden. Experiments on multi-agent navigation
tasks demonstrate that MAD-PINN achieves superior safety-performance
trade-offs, maintains scalability as the number of agents grows, and
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

### [1091] [Prepare for Warp Speed: Sub-millisecond Visual Place Recognition Using Event Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24094)
*Vignesh Ramanathan,Michael Milford,Tobias Fischer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents 'Flash,' a lightweight Visual Place Recognition (VPR) system using sub-millisecond event camera data, achieving faster and more accurate localization than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of existing event-camera-based VPR systems, which rely on dense representations and require longer timeframes for predictions, aiming to improve the efficiency and speed of VPR.

Method: The proposed method leverages active pixel locations as discriminative features, encodes these using binary frames, and computes similarities with fast bitwise operations, normalized for relative event activity between frames.

Result: Flash achieves significant performance improvements, with 11.33x and 5.92x Recall@1 increases over baselines on two datasets. Improved localization latency is demonstrated via the 'Time to Correct Match' metric.

Conclusion: This is the first known system to achieve sub-millisecond VPR using event cameras, providing both accuracy and reduced localization delay, marking a significant advance for autonomous navigation.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables systems to identify previously visited
locations within a map, a fundamental task for autonomous navigation. Prior
works have developed VPR solutions using event cameras, which asynchronously
measure per-pixel brightness changes with microsecond temporal resolution.
However, these approaches rely on dense representations of the inherently
sparse camera output and require tens to hundreds of milliseconds of event data
to predict a place. Here, we break this paradigm with Flash, a lightweight VPR
system that predicts places using sub-millisecond slices of event data. Our
method is based on the observation that active pixel locations provide strong
discriminative features for VPR. Flash encodes these active pixel locations
using efficient binary frames and computes similarities via fast bitwise
operations, which are then normalized based on the relative event activity in
the query and reference frames. Flash improves Recall@1 for sub-millisecond VPR
over existing baselines by 11.33x on the indoor QCR-Event-Dataset and 5.92x on
the 8 km Brisbane-Event-VPR dataset. Moreover, our approach reduces the
duration for which the robot must operate without awareness of its position, as
evidenced by a localization latency metric we term Time to Correct Match (TCM).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate
sub-millisecond VPR using event cameras.

*Ilari Vallivaara,Bingnan Duan,Yinhuan Dong,Tughrul Arslan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel linear-time method for diversity maintenance in particle filtering, leveraging ancestry tree topology clustering for improved results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address premature convergence and compactness issues in multimodal particle filtering environments.

Method: Diversity maintenance is achieved by clustering particles based on ancestry tree topology, intra-cluster fitness sharing, and protecting non-clustered particles.

Result: The method shows high success rates, robust cross-domain performance, and handles challenging initial conditions effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides significant improvement in multimodal environments with minimal effect on compactness, demonstrating robustness and broad applicability.

Abstract: We propose a method for linear-time diversity maintenance in particle
filtering. It clusters particles based on ancestry tree topology: closely
related particles in sufficiently large subtrees are grouped together. The main
idea is that the tree structure implicitly encodes similarity without the need
for spatial or other domain-specific metrics. This approach, when combined with
intra-cluster fitness sharing and the protection of particles not included in a
cluster, effectively prevents premature convergence in multimodal environments
while maintaining estimate compactness. We validate our approach in a
multimodal robotics simulation and a real-world multimodal indoor environment.
We compare the performance to several diversity maintenance algorithms from the
literature, including Deterministic Resampling and Particle Gaussian Mixtures.
Our algorithm achieves high success rates with little to no negative effect on
compactness, showing particular robustness to different domains and challenging
initial conditions.

### [1093] [BOSfM: A View Planning Framework for Optimal 3D Reconstruction of Agricultural Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24126)
*Athanasios Bacharis,Konstantinos D. Polyzos,Georgios B. Giannakis,Nikolaos Papanikolopoulos*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a view planning (VP) framework using Bayesian optimization to determine optimal camera placements, improving 3D reconstruction accuracy in agricultural settings despite noise and generalization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of using numerous arbitrarily captured 2D images for 3D reconstruction in agricultural tasks, by optimizing camera placements to capture fewer but more informative images.

Method: The authors propose a Bayesian optimization-based VP framework that optimizes camera placements in 3D space, using a structure-from-motion approach for quality-based reconstruction while considering noise and generalization challenges.

Result: Numerical experiments in both simulated and real agricultural environments demonstrate that the proposed VP method effectively identifies optimal camera placements, achieving accurate 3D reconstruction and generalizing well to new environments.

Conclusion: The presented VP framework efficiently optimizes camera placements for accurate 3D environment reconstruction, overcoming noise and generalization challenges, and is applicable in diverse agricultural scenarios.

Abstract: Active vision (AV) has been in the spotlight of robotics research due to its
emergence in numerous applications including agricultural tasks such as
precision crop monitoring and autonomous harvesting to list a few. A major AV
problem that gained popularity is the 3D reconstruction of targeted
environments using 2D images from diverse viewpoints. While collecting and
processing a large number of arbitrarily captured 2D images can be arduous in
many practical scenarios, a more efficient solution involves optimizing the
placement of available cameras in 3D space to capture fewer, yet more
informative, images that provide sufficient visual information for effective
reconstruction of the environment of interest. This process termed as view
planning (VP), can be markedly challenged (i) by noise emerging in the location
of the cameras and/or in the extracted images, and (ii) by the need to
generalize well in other unknown similar agricultural environments without need
for re-optimizing or re-training. To cope with these challenges, the present
work presents a novel VP framework that considers a reconstruction
quality-based optimization formulation that relies on the notion of
`structure-from-motion' to reconstruct the 3D structure of the sought
environment from the selected 2D images. With no analytic expression of the
optimization function and with costly function evaluations, a Bayesian
optimization approach is proposed to efficiently carry out the VP process using
only a few function evaluations, while accounting for different noise cases.
Numerical tests on both simulated and real agricultural settings signify the
benefits of the advocated VP approach in efficiently estimating the optimal
camera placement to accurately reconstruct 3D environments of interest, and
generalize well on similar unknown environments.

*Priyanka Mandikal,Jiaheng Hu,Shivin Dass,Sagnik Majumder,Roberto Martín-Martín,Kristen Grauman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPARTA is a framework for robot manipulation tasks focusing on progressive physical and visual state changes in objects, like mashing or slicing, rather than their positions. It introduces structured policy observations and dense rewards for improved robotic task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address a gap in robotic manipulation focusing on tasks where objects undergo physical and visual state changes rather than kinematic changes.

Method: SPARTA uses spatially progressing object change segmentation maps to build structured observations and dense rewards. These are used in two policy approaches: reinforcement learning for detailed control and greedy control for quick deployments.

Result: SPARTA demonstrated improved training efficiency and accuracy on real robots across diverse tasks and objects compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: SPARTA establishes progress-aware visual representations as a robust approach for tackling object state manipulation, emphasizing versatility in robotic control applications.

Abstract: Most robot manipulation focuses on changing the kinematic state of objects:
picking, placing, opening, or rotating them. However, a wide range of
real-world manipulation tasks involve a different class of object state
change--such as mashing, spreading, or slicing--where the object's physical and
visual state evolve progressively without necessarily changing its position. We
present SPARTA, the first unified framework for the family of object state
change manipulation tasks. Our key insight is that these tasks share a common
structural pattern: they involve spatially-progressing, object-centric changes
that can be represented as regions transitioning from an actionable to a
transformed state. Building on this insight, SPARTA integrates spatially
progressing object change segmentation maps, a visual skill to perceive
actionable vs. transformed regions for specific object state change tasks, to
generate a) structured policy observations that strip away appearance
variability, and b) dense rewards that capture incremental progress over time.
These are leveraged in two SPARTA policy variants: reinforcement learning for
fine-grained control without demonstrations or simulation; and greedy control
for fast, lightweight deployment. We validate SPARTA on a real robot for three
challenging tasks across 10 diverse real-world objects, achieving significant
improvements in training time and accuracy over sparse rewards and visual
goal-conditioned baselines. Our results highlight progress-aware visual
representations as a versatile foundation for the broader family of object
state manipulation tasks. Project website:

### [1095] [A Novel Model for 3D Motion Planning for a Generalized Dubins Vehicle with Pitch and Yaw Rate Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24143)
*Deepak Prakash Kumar,Swaroop Darbha,Satyanarayana Gupta Manyam,David Casbeer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel 3D motion planning framework for fixed-wing UAVs using full orientation and two control inputs, improving path feasibility and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D motion planning methods inadequately address fixed-wing UAVs, as they often neglect full vehicle orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) or use overly simplified controls, resulting in insufficiently accurate path modeling.

Method: The proposed approach employs a rotation-minimizing frame for vehicle orientation and concatenates optimal Dubins paths on various surfaces to account for realistic kinematics with two control inputs representing bounded pitch and yaw rates.

Result: Numerical simulations demonstrate that the method produces feasible paths within 10 seconds on average and achieves shorter paths compared to prior approaches in most scenarios.

Conclusion: The method offers a significant improvement over existing algorithms by integrating a more complete vehicle orientation model and leveraging two control inputs, enhancing both practicality and efficiency for UAV motion planning.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new modeling approach and a fast algorithm for 3D
motion planning, applicable for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles. The goal
is to construct the shortest path connecting given initial and final
configurations subject to motion constraints. Our work differs from existing
literature in two ways. First, we consider full vehicle orientation using a
body-attached frame, which includes roll, pitch, and yaw angles. However,
existing work uses only pitch and/or heading angle, which is insufficient to
uniquely determine orientation. Second, we use two control inputs to represent
bounded pitch and yaw rates, reflecting control by two separate actuators. In
contrast, most previous methods rely on a single input, such as path curvature,
which is insufficient for accurately modeling the vehicle's kinematics in 3D.
We use a rotation minimizing frame to describe the vehicle's configuration and
its evolution, and construct paths by concatenating optimal Dubins paths on
spherical, cylindrical, or planar surfaces. Numerical simulations show our
approach generates feasible paths within 10 seconds on average and yields
shorter paths than existing methods in most cases.

*Tomoyuki Kagaya,Subramanian Lakshmi,Yuxuan Lou,Thong Jing Yuan,Jayashree Karlekar,Sugiri Pranata,Natsuki Murakami,Akira Kinose,Yang You*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents Memory Transfer Planning (MTP), a framework that uses successful code examples from various environments to guide large language model-driven planning, improving robot manipulation adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for robot manipulation using large language models struggle to adapt to new environments due to reliance on static prompts and environment-specific policy training.

Method: MTP employs a three-step process where initial plans and codes are generated using LLMs, followed by retrieval of relevant examples from a code memory, and contextual adaptation of these codes for re-planning without modifying the model parameters.

Result: MTP demonstrated improved success rates and adaptability across RLBench, CALVIN, and physical robot tasks compared to fixed-prompt methods and naive retrieval strategies. Simulation-based memory construction also proved effective in hardware experiments.

Conclusion: MTP enhances large language model-driven planning robustness and adaptability in diverse robotic manipulation environments, providing a bridge between simulated and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly explored in robot manipulation,
but many existing methods struggle to adapt to new environments. Many systems
require either environment-specific policy training or depend on fixed prompts
and single-shot code generation, leading to limited transferability and manual
re-tuning. We introduce Memory Transfer Planning (MTP), a framework that
leverages successful control-code examples from different environments as
procedural knowledge, using them as in-context guidance for LLM-driven
planning. Specifically, MTP (i) generates an initial plan and code using LLMs,
(ii) retrieves relevant successful examples from a code memory, and (iii)
contextually adapts the retrieved code to the target setting for re-planning
without updating model parameters. We evaluate MTP on RLBench, CALVIN, and a
physical robot, demonstrating effectiveness beyond simulation. Across these
settings, MTP consistently improved success rate and adaptability compared with
fixed-prompt code generation, naive retrieval, and memory-free re-planning.
Furthermore, in hardware experiments, leveraging a memory constructed in
simulation proved effective. MTP provides a practical approach that exploits
procedural knowledge to realize robust LLM-based planning across diverse
robotic manipulation scenarios, enhancing adaptability to novel environments
and bridging simulation and real-world deployment.

*Wanming Yu,Adrian Röfer,Abhinav Valada,Sethu Vijayakumar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates the use of multimodal large language models (LLMs) as high-level planners for long-horizon robotic stacking tasks, enhanced through fine-tuning on a custom dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained LLMs lack the knowledge and ability to handle long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks, particularly those requiring reasoning about physical properties like weight and stability.

Method: The authors propose a multimodal LLM framework that takes multimodal inputs about objects and infers optimal stacking sequences. The LLM is fine-tuned using a custom dataset that incorporates stacking preferences like weight, stability, size, and footprint.

Result: The fine-tuned LLM demonstrated improved stacking task completion over prompt-tuned pretrained LLMs in simulations and successfully performed real-world experiments with a humanoid robot.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning a multimodal LLM with a custom dataset improves its effectiveness in long-horizon robotic stacking tasks, suggesting its potential as a high-level planner for complex physical manipulation.

Abstract: Pretrained large language models (LLMs) can work as high-level robotic
planners by reasoning over abstract task descriptions and natural language
instructions, etc. However, they have shown a lack of knowledge and
effectiveness in planning long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks where the
physical properties of the objects are essential. An example is the stacking of
containers with hidden objects inside, which involves reasoning over hidden
physics properties such as weight and stability. To this end, this paper
proposes to use multimodal LLMs as high-level planners for such long-horizon
robotic stacking tasks. The LLM takes multimodal inputs for each object to
stack and infers the current best stacking sequence by reasoning over stacking
preferences. Furthermore, in order to enable the LLM to reason over multiple
preferences at the same time without giving explicit instructions, we propose
to create a custom dataset considering stacking preferences including weight,
stability, size, and footprint, to fine-tune the LLM. Compared to the
pretrained LLM with prompt tuning, we demonstrate the improved stacking
completion of the LLM fine-tuned with our custom dataset via large-scale
simulation evaluation. Furthermore, we showcase the effectiveness of the
proposed framework for the long-horizon stacking task on a real humanoid robot
in an online manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving stability and overcoming hardware limitations in torque control to enable agile and reliable robot motion.

Method: Developing a high-frequency linear feedback system (up to 40 kHz) to interpolate non-linear schemes like inverse dynamics and learned torque policies on readily available open-source hardware.

Result: Stabilization of torque controllers through high-frequency linear feedback demonstrated as effective in unlocking agility and robustness in torque-controlled robots.

Conclusion: High-frequency linear feedback is a promising approach for stabilizing torque-controlled robotics, fostering more advanced and reliable robot motion capabilities.

Abstract: Torque control enables agile and robust robot motion, but deployment is often
hindered by instability and hardware limits. Here, we present a novel solution
to execute whole-body linear feedback at up to 40 kHz on open-source hardware.
We use this to interpolate non-linear schemes during real-world execution, such
as inverse dynamics and learned torque policies. Our results show that by
stabilizing torque controllers, high-frequency linear feedback could be an
effective route towards unlocking the potential of torque-controlled robotics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces ViReSkill, a framework that enhances robot motion planning by addressing challenges in deploying LLMs/VLMs and combining vision-grounded replanning with a skill memory to improve reliability and learning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving robot adaptability to new tasks since RL and IL suffer from slow adaptation, while LLMs and VLMs offer a promising alternative despite current challenges with symbolic grounding and execution consistency.

Method: Proposed ViReSkill pairs vision-grounded replanning with a skill memory; it regenerates action sequences when plans fail and stores successful executions as reusable skills, forming a feedback loop for continual skill learning.

Result: ViReSkill outperformed existing baselines in task success rate across simulators (LIBERO, RLBench) and a physical robot, showing robust generalization from simulation to real-world applications.

Conclusion: ViReSkill provides a reliable framework for efficient and adaptable robot motion planning, addressing key limitations in LLMs/VLMs through a hybrid approach, and achieves superior performance in various settings.

Abstract: Robots trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Imitation Learning (IL)
often adapt slowly to new tasks, whereas recent Large Language Models (LLMs)
and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) promise knowledge-rich planning from minimal
data. Deploying LLMs/VLMs for motion planning, however, faces two key
obstacles: (i) symbolic plans are rarely grounded in scene geometry and object
physics, and (ii) model outputs can vary for identical prompts, undermining
execution reliability. We propose ViReSkill, a framework that pairs
vision-grounded replanning with a skill memory for accumulation and reuse. When
a failure occurs, the replanner generates a new action sequence conditioned on
the current scene, tailored to the observed state. On success, the executed
plan is stored as a reusable skill and replayed in future encounters without
additional calls to LLMs/VLMs. This feedback loop enables autonomous continual
learning: each attempt immediately expands the skill set and stabilizes
subsequent executions. We evaluate ViReSkill on simulators such as LIBERO and
RLBench as well as on a physical robot. Across all settings, it consistently
outperforms conventional baselines in task success rate, demonstrating robust
sim-to-real generalization.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the "Logic Network Flow" framework, integrating temporal logic into mixed-integer optimization for robot planning with improved speed and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance task and motion planning for robots by integrating temporal logic into more computationally efficient formulations.

Method: Builds on the Graph-of-Convex-Sets model and introduces a network-flow-based Fourier-Motzkin elimination to optimize temporal logic constraints in motion planning.

Result: Demonstrated significant computational speedups in experiments with tasks like vehicle routing and multi-robot coordination. Hardware validations were conducted using quadrupedal robots for real-time scenario adaptation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is efficient, scalable, and robust for real-time robot planning in dynamic environments, outperforming conventional methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes an optimization-based task and motion planning framework,
named "Logic Network Flow", that integrates temporal logic specifications into
mixed-integer programs for efficient robot planning. Inspired by the
Graph-of-Convex-Sets formulation, temporal predicates are encoded as polyhedron
constraints on each edge of a network flow model, instead of as constraints
between nodes in traditional Logic Tree formulations. We further propose a
network-flow-based Fourier-Motzkin elimination procedure that removes
continuous flow variables while preserving convex relaxation tightness, leading
to provably tighter convex relaxations and fewer constraints than Logic Tree
formulations. For temporal logic motion planning with piecewise-affine dynamic
systems, comprehensive experiments across vehicle routing, multi-robot
coordination, and temporal logic control on dynamical systems using point mass
and linear inverted pendulum models demonstrate computational speedups of up to
several orders of magnitude. Hardware demonstrations with quadrupedal robots
validate real-time replanning capabilities under dynamically changing
environmental conditions. The project website is at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel RGB-D SLAM system combining learning-based initialization and optimization-based refinement for real-time dense scene reconstruction under unstable camera motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RGB-D SLAM systems struggle with large viewpoint changes, sudden shaking, or fast motions. Classical methods fail without good initialization, while learning-based methods lack accuracy for dense reconstructions.

Method: The authors use a camera pose regression network to predict reliable relative poses, complemented by a randomized optimization algorithm for precise depth image alignment with scene geometry.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms competitors on challenging motion benchmarks and maintains accuracy during stable camera sequences, operating in real-time.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that integrating learning-based initialization with principled optimization results in a robust and accurate SLAM system for unstable and dense scenarios.

Abstract: Real-time dense scene reconstruction during unstable camera motions is
crucial for robotics, yet current RGB-D SLAM systems fail when cameras
experience large viewpoint changes, fast motions, or sudden shaking. Classical
optimization-based methods deliver high accuracy but fail with poor
initialization during large motions, while learning-based approaches provide
robustness but lack sufficient accuracy for dense reconstruction. We address
this challenge through a combination of learning-based initialization with
optimization-based refinement. Our method employs a camera pose regression
network to predict metric-aware relative poses from consecutive RGB-D frames,
which serve as reliable starting points for a randomized optimization algorithm
that further aligns depth images with the scene geometry. Extensive experiments
demonstrate promising results: our approach outperforms the best competitor on
challenging benchmarks, while maintaining comparable accuracy on stable motion
sequences. The system operates in real-time, showcasing that combining simple
and principled techniques can achieve both robustness for unstable motions and
accuracy for dense reconstruction. Project page:

*Jeongyong Yang,Seunghwan Jang,Soojean Han*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SafeFlowMatcher, a planning framework combining flow matching techniques and control barrier functions (CBFs) to ensure efficient and safe navigation paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative planners using flow matching often lack formal safety guarantees and can produce incomplete paths near constraints, necessitating a framework that ensures certified safety and efficiency.

Method: SafeFlowMatcher employs a two-phase prediction-correction integrator, leveraging flow matching for path generation and correcting paths using vanishing time-scaled vector fields and CBF-based quadratic programming.

Result: Experiments on maze navigation and locomotion benchmarks show SafeFlowMatcher achieving faster, smoother, and safer paths compared to baseline techniques. Ablation studies validate the framework's components.

Conclusion: SafeFlowMatcher successfully integrates flow matching and CBFs to provide real-time efficient and safe paths, addressing the limitations of prior generative planners.

Abstract: Generative planners based on flow matching (FM) can produce high-quality
paths in one or a few ODE steps, but their sampling dynamics offer no formal
safety guarantees and can yield incomplete paths near constraints. We present
SafeFlowMatcher, a planning framework that couples FM with control barrier
functions (CBFs) to achieve both real-time efficiency and certified safety.
SafeFlowMatcher uses a two-phase prediction-correction (PC) integrator: (i) a
prediction phase integrates the learned FM once (or a few steps) to obtain a
candidate path without intervention; (ii) a correction phase refines this path
with a vanishing time-scaled vector field and a CBF-based quadratic program
that minimally perturbs the vector field. We prove a barrier certificate for
the resulting flow system, establishing forward invariance of a robust safe set
and finite-time convergence to the safe set. By enforcing safety only on the
executed path (rather than on all intermediate latent paths), SafeFlowMatcher
avoids distributional drift and mitigates local trap problems. Across maze
navigation and locomotion benchmarks, SafeFlowMatcher attains faster, smoother,
and safer paths than diffusion- and FM-based baselines. Extensive ablations
corroborate the contributions of the PC integrator and the barrier certificate.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study introduces a method, "Contextual NeuroMHE," which optimizes data collection from key environmental contexts using Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Processes, improving quadrotor trajectory tracking by 20.3% in error reduction compared to prior techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional adaptive controllers for quadrotors face challenges due to the variability and uncertainty of real-world disturbances, often requiring extensive fine-tuning and becoming brittle to changing conditions. Machine-learning alternatives also struggle with inefficiencies when training across diverse contexts.

Method: The paper proposes a method called Contextual NeuroMHE, which utilizes Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Processes to selectively gather data from critical environmental contexts. This approach dynamically tunes neural network parameters to enhance generalization and efficiency while minimizing extensive data collection.

Result: The experimental outcomes show that Contextual NeuroMHE delivers a 20.3% improvement in maximum absolute position error compared to existing methods and successfully adapts to environmental variations using fewer, strategically chosen contexts.

Conclusion: Contextual NeuroMHE addresses the inflexibility of existing controllers by enabling efficient and effective parameter tuning through selected environmental context data. This approach improves both robustness and adaptability for quadrotor trajectory tracking in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Adaptive controllers on quadrotors typically rely on estimation of
disturbances to ensure robust trajectory tracking. Estimating disturbances
across diverse environmental contexts is challenging due to the inherent
variability and uncertainty in the real world. Such estimators require
extensive fine-tuning for a specific scenario, which makes them inflexible and
brittle to changing conditions. Machine-learning approaches, such as training a
neural network to tune the estimator's parameters, are promising. However,
collecting data across all possible environmental contexts is impossible. It is
also inefficient as the same estimator parameters could work for "nearby"
contexts. In this paper, we present a sequential decision making strategy that
decides which environmental contexts, using Bayesian Optimization with a
Gaussian Process, to collect data from in order to ensure robust performance
across a wide range of contexts. Our method, Contextual NeuroMHE, eliminates
the need for exhaustive training across all environments while maintaining
robust performance under different conditions. By enabling the neural network
to adapt its parameters dynamically, our method improves both efficiency and
generalization. Experimental results in various real-world settings demonstrate
that our approach outperforms the prior work by 20.3\% in terms of maximum
absolute position error and can capture the variations in the environment with
a few carefully chosen contexts.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid framework that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) for sampling trajectory regions in motion planning with analytical trajectory evaluation, improving efficiency and reliability in autonomous urban driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In complex urban scenarios, uniform or heuristic sampling in motion planning often generates infeasible or irrelevant trajectories, which limits efficiency and responsiveness.

Method: The authors combine a reinforcement learning (RL) guided sampling approach with a world model (WM) that uses a decodable deep set encoder to handle variable traffic participants. The framework ensures analytical and verifiable trajectory evaluation and selection.

Result: The approach demonstrates up to 99% fewer required samples and an 84% reduction in runtime in the CommonRoad simulation, while maintaining high planning quality in terms of success and collision-free rates.

Conclusion: The proposed framework results in faster and more reliable decision-making for autonomous vehicles in urban environments, improving safety and responsiveness under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Sampling-based motion planning is a well-established approach in autonomous
driving, valued for its modularity and analytical tractability. In complex
urban scenarios, however, uniform or heuristic sampling often produces many
infeasible or irrelevant trajectories. We address this limitation with a hybrid
framework that learns where to sample while keeping trajectory generation and
evaluation fully analytical and verifiable. A reinforcement learning (RL) agent
guides the sampling process toward regions of the action space likely to yield
feasible trajectories, while evaluation and final selection remains governed by
deterministic feasibility checks and cost functions. We couple the RL sampler
with a world model (WM) based on a decodable deep set encoder, enabling both
variable numbers of traffic participants and reconstructable latent
representations. The approach is evaluated in the CommonRoad simulation
environment, showing up to 99% fewer required samples and a runtime reduction
of up to 84% while maintaining planning quality in terms of success and
collision-free rates. These improvements lead to faster, more reliable
decision-making for autonomous vehicles in urban environments, achieving safer
and more responsive navigation under real-world constraints. Code and trained

TL;DR: The paper introduces SONAR, a method combining semantic maps and Vision-Language Models for improved robot navigation in unknown environments, achieving a success rate of 38.4%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Vision-Language Navigation struggle with generalization and weak semantic cues, necessitating a more robust and adaptable approach.

Method: SONAR combines a semantic map-based target prediction module with a Vision-Language Model-based value map module. It also uses multi-scale semantic maps with confidence maps for better target detection.

Result: SONAR demonstrated a 38.4% success rate and an SPL of 17.7% in experiments using the Gazebo simulator and Matterport 3D dataset.

Conclusion: SONAR presents a balanced approach to improving generalization and adaptability in navigation tasks, showing robust performance under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Understanding human instructions and accomplishing Vision-Language Navigation
tasks in unknown environments is essential for robots. However, existing
modular approaches heavily rely on the quality of training data and often
exhibit poor generalization. Vision-Language Model based methods, while
demonstrating strong generalization capabilities, tend to perform
unsatisfactorily when semantic cues are weak. To address these issues, this
paper proposes SONAR, an aggregated reasoning approach through a cross modal
paradigm. The proposed method integrates a semantic map based target prediction
module with a Vision-Language Model based value map module, enabling more
robust navigation in unknown environments with varying levels of semantic cues,
and effectively balancing generalization ability with scene adaptability. In
terms of target localization, we propose a strategy that integrates multi-scale
semantic maps with confidence maps, aiming to mitigate false detections of
target objects. We conducted an evaluation of the SONAR within the Gazebo
simulator, leveraging the most challenging Matterport 3D (MP3D) dataset as the
experimental benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that SONAR achieves a
success rate of 38.4% and an SPL of 17.7%.

Result: AdaNav achieves notable performance gains, with a 20% success rate increase on R2R val-unseen, 11.7% on RxR-CE, and 11.4% in real-world scenarios while being trained on only 6K samples.

Conclusion: AdaNav demonstrates the importance of adaptive reasoning in VLN tasks, achieving efficiency and superior results compared to models relying on vast datasets and fixed-step reasoning.

Abstract: Vision Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural language
instructions by grounding them in sequential visual observations over long
horizons. Explicit reasoning could enhance temporal consistency and perception
action alignment, but reasoning at fixed steps often leads to suboptimal
performance and unnecessary computation. To address this, we propose AdaNav, an
uncertainty-based adaptive reasoning framework for VLN. At its core is the
Uncertainty Adaptive Reasoning Block (UAR), a lightweight plugin that
dynamically triggers reasoning. We introduce Action Entropy as a policy prior
for UAR and progressively refine it through a Heuristics to RL training method,
enabling agents to learn difficulty aware reasoning policies under the strict
data limitations of embodied tasks. Results show that with only 6K training
samples, AdaNav achieves substantial gains over closed source models trained on
million scale data, improving success rate by 20% on R2R val-unseen, 11.7% on
RxR-CE, and 11.4% in real world scenes. The code is available at

*Tianqiang Yan,Ziqiao Lin,Sicheng Wang,Tianwei Zhang,Zhenglong Sun*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study addresses the hazards of misleading human directives to robots, introducing a framework (DynaMIC) to detect such issues and ensure safer task execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing integration of large pre-trained language models in robotics but potential errors arise when robots blindly follow misleading human instructions, posing safety risks.

Method: The study introduces directive counterfactuals (DCFs) related to misleading human directives and develops DynaMIC, a framework to generate robot task flows for identifying these DCFs.

Result: Semantic-level experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the DynaMIC framework in detecting directive counterfactuals.

Conclusion: DynaMIC enhances the reliability and safety of robot task execution by making robots sensitive to directive counterfactuals, emphasizing its importance for future research.

Abstract: The emergence of large pre-trained models based on natural language has
breathed new life into robotics development. Extensive research has integrated
large models with robots, utilizing the powerful semantic understanding and
generation capabilities of large models to facilitate robot control through
natural language instructions gradually. However, we found that robots that
strictly adhere to human instructions, especially those containing misleading
information, may encounter errors during task execution, potentially leading to
safety hazards. This resembles the concept of counterfactuals in natural
language processing (NLP), which has not yet attracted much attention in
robotic research. In an effort to highlight this issue for future studies, this
paper introduced directive counterfactuals (DCFs) arising from misleading human
directives. We present DynaMIC, a framework for generating robot task flows to
identify DCFs and relay feedback to humans proactively. This capability can
help robots be sensitive to potential DCFs within a task, thus enhancing the
reliability of the execution process. We conducted semantic-level experiments
and ablation studies, showcasing the effectiveness of this framework.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PhysiAgent, a framework integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for improved real-world task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VLA models have achieved some success, their generalization is limited. This paper aims to address this by better integrating generalized VLMs with VLAs in a more collaborative and dynamic manner.

Method: The proposed PhysiAgent framework includes mechanisms such as monitor, memory, and self-reflection, allowing VLMs and VLAs to collaborate adaptively. It leverages lightweight toolboxes and uses real-time feedback for optimization.

Result: PhysiAgent demonstrated significant performance improvements in solving complex real-world robotic tasks, achieving better self-regulation, integration, and adaptability.

Conclusion: PhysiAgent represents a pioneering step in integrating VLMs and VLAs into a cohesive, real-world-effective embodied agent framework.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved notable success but often
struggle with limited generalizations. To address this, integrating generalized
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as assistants to VLAs has emerged as a popular
solution. However, current approaches often combine these models in rigid,
sequential structures: using VLMs primarily for high-level scene understanding
and task planning, and VLAs merely as executors of lower-level actions, leading
to ineffective collaboration and poor grounding challenges. In this paper, we
propose an embodied agent framework, PhysiAgent, tailored to operate
effectively in physical environments. By incorporating monitor, memory,
self-reflection mechanisms, and lightweight off-the-shelf toolboxes, PhysiAgent
offers an autonomous scaffolding framework to prompt VLMs to organize different
components based on real-time proficiency feedback from VLAs to maximally
exploit VLAs' capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in task-solving performance on complex real-world robotic tasks,
showcasing effective self-regulation of VLMs, coherent tool collaboration, and
adaptive evolution of the framework during execution. PhysiAgent makes
practical and pioneering efforts to integrate VLMs and VLAs, effectively
grounding embodied agent frameworks in real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the role of robots in fostering trust and cooperation in human-robot mixed groups.

Method: A modified version of the Public Good Game (PGG) was used to test three game strategies (always cooperate, always free ride, tit-for-tat) with nineteen participants and the iCub robot.

Result: Preliminary findings show that participants prefer not to invest money in the common pool despite perceiving the robot as generous.

Conclusion: The study suggests potential for developing social robots that enhance trust and cooperation in mixed human-robot groups.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the potential of Game Theory as a means to
investigate cooperation and trust in human-robot mixed groups. Particularly, we
introduce the Public Good Game (PGG), a model highlighting the tension between
individual self-interest and collective well-being. In this work, we present a
modified version of the PGG, where three human participants engage in the game
with the humanoid robot iCub to assess whether various robot game strategies
(e.g., always cooperate, always free ride, and tit-for-tat) can influence the
participants' inclination to cooperate. We test our setup during a pilot study
with nineteen participants. A preliminary analysis indicates that participants
prefer not to invest their money in the common pool, despite they perceive the
robot as generous. By conducting this research, we seek to gain valuable
insights into the role that robots can play in promoting trust and cohesion
during human-robot interactions within group contexts. The results of this
study may hold considerable potential for developing social robots capable of
fostering trust and cooperation within mixed human-robot groups.

*Nayari Marie Lessa,Melya Boukheddimi,Frank Kirchner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Imitation Learning (IL) framework that combines Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) for improved robotic motion imitation and task execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing robotic Imitation Learning methods, particularly their reliance on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which sacrifices sample efficiency and policy generalization for stability.

Method: The authors integrate Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) with off-policy learning via the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, enabling better data efficiency, exploration, and naturalistic robotic motion.

Result: Experimental evaluations on quadruped systems across multiple reference motions and terrains show higher imitation rewards with AMP+SAC compared to AMP+PPO, while maintaining stability.

Conclusion: The proposed AMP+SAC framework advances the capability of robotic motion generation, showcasing the benefits of off-policy learning in imitation-based approaches.

Abstract: Learning-based methods have enabled robots to acquire bio-inspired movements
with increasing levels of naturalness and adaptability. Among these, Imitation
Learning (IL) has proven effective in transferring complex motion patterns from
animals to robotic systems. However, current state-of-the-art frameworks
predominantly rely on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), an on-policy
algorithm that prioritizes stability over sample efficiency and policy
generalization. This paper proposes a novel IL framework that combines
Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) with the off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)
algorithm to overcome these limitations. This integration leverages
replay-driven learning and entropy-regularized exploration, enabling
naturalistic behavior and task execution, improving data efficiency and
robustness. We evaluate the proposed approach (AMP+SAC) on quadruped gaits
involving multiple reference motions and diverse terrains. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework not only maintains stable task
execution but also achieves higher imitation rewards compared to the widely
used AMP+PPO method. These findings highlight the potential of an off-policy IL
formulation for advancing motion generation in robotics.

TL;DR: This paper develops a framework to enable multi-robot teams to carry out natural language expressed tasks by combining language models, RNNs, and GNNs for decentralized task execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the reasoning capabilities of language models for enabling robots to understand and decompose high-level user commands into actionable, collaborative robot behaviors.

Method: The framework uses deterministic finite automata (DFA) to structure tasks, trains recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to encode task logic, and employs a graph neural network (GNN) control policy conditioned on the RNN states and language embeddings for decentralized decision-making.

Result: The method is demonstrated to perform well on a range of simulated and real-world multi-robot tasks requiring cooperation and sequential task execution.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively combines recent advancements in language models and neural network capabilities to create an interpretable, decentralized, and interactive multi-robot task execution system, showing promise for real-world applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework towards prompting multi-robot teams with
high-level tasks using natural language expressions. Our objective is to use
the reasoning capabilities demonstrated by recent language models in
understanding and decomposing human expressions of intent, and repurpose these
for multi-robot collaboration and decision-making. The key challenge is that an
individual's behavior in a collective can be hard to specify and interpret, and
must continuously adapt to actions from others. This necessitates a framework
that possesses the representational capacity required by the logic and
semantics of a task, and yet supports decentralized and interactive real-time
operation. We solve this dilemma by recognizing that a task can be represented
as a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and that recurrent neural networks
(RNNs) can encode numerous automata. This allows us to distill the logic and
sequential decompositions of sub-tasks obtained from a language model into an
RNN, and align its internal states with the semantics of a given task. By
training a graph neural network (GNN) control policy that is conditioned on the
hidden states of the RNN and the language embeddings, our method enables robots
to execute task-relevant actions in a decentralized manner. We present
evaluations of this single light-weight interpretable model on various
simulated and real-world multi-robot tasks that require sequential and
collaborative behavior by the team -- sites.google.com/view/prompting-teams.

TL;DR: Diffusion-based methods like U-Net have limitations in global context modeling and smoothing in robotic visuomotor control. U-DiT, a novel Transformer-based framework, mitigates these issues and demonstrates superior performance and robustness both in simulation and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing diffusion-based methods such as limited global context modeling and over-smoothing artifacts in robotic visuomotor control.

Method: The paper introduces U-DiT Policy, a U-shaped Diffusion Transformer model that combines the multi-scale feature fusion of U-Net with the global context modeling of Transformers.

Result: U-DiT achieves a 10% average performance improvement over baseline methods in simulations, outperforms DP-T models by 6%, and demonstrates superior generalization and robustness in real-world tasks with a 22.5% improvement over DP-U.

Conclusion: U-DiT Policy enhances the representation, generalization, and robustness of diffusion-based visuomotor frameworks in robotic manipulation, making it a promising tool for both simulation and real-world applications.

Abstract: Diffusion-based methods have been acknowledged as a powerful paradigm for
end-to-end visuomotor control in robotics. Most existing approaches adopt a
Diffusion Policy in U-Net architecture (DP-U), which, while effective, suffers
from limited global context modeling and over-smoothing artifacts. To address
these issues, we propose U-DiT Policy, a novel U-shaped Diffusion Transformer
framework. U-DiT preserves the multi-scale feature fusion advantages of U-Net
while integrating the global context modeling capability of Transformers,
thereby enhancing representational power and policy expressiveness. We evaluate
U-DiT extensively across both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation
tasks. In simulation, U-DiT achieves an average performance gain of 10\% over
baseline methods and surpasses Transformer-based diffusion policies (DP-T) that
use AdaLN blocks by 6\% under comparable parameter budgets. On real-world
robotic tasks, U-DiT demonstrates superior generalization and robustness,
achieving an average improvement of 22.5\% over DP-U. In addition, robustness
and generalization experiments under distractor and lighting variations further
highlight the advantages of U-DiT. These results highlight the effectiveness
and practical potential of U-DiT Policy as a new foundation for diffusion-based
robotic manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aimed to address the limitations of multi-stage pipelines and auxiliary modalities in robot state estimation and control, proposing a unified framework for scalable and efficient integration.

Method: PoseDiff leverages diffusion modeling to map visual inputs into structured robot states and generates continuous action sequences using video keyframes and an overlap-averaging strategy.

Result: PoseDiff demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy on the DREAM dataset for pose estimation and improved manipulation success rates on Libero tasks, even in offline conditions.

Conclusion: PoseDiff offers an efficient and scalable integration of perception and control in embodied AI, advancing robot performance in state estimation and manipulation tasks.

Abstract: We present PoseDiff, a conditional diffusion model that unifies robot state
estimation and control within a single framework. At its core, PoseDiff maps
raw visual observations into structured robot states-such as 3D keypoints or
joint angles-from a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-stage
pipelines or auxiliary modalities. Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff
extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on
sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and
continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy.
This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception
and control. On the DREAM dataset, PoseDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
and real-time performance for pose estimation. On Libero-Object manipulation
tasks, it substantially improves success rates over existing inverse dynamics
modules, even under strict offline settings. Together, these results show that
PoseDiff provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient bridge between
perception, planning, and control in embodied AI. The video visualization

*Zhiyuan Wu,Rolandos Alexandros Potamias,Xuyang Zhang,Zhongqun Zhang,Jiankang Deng,Shan Luo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces CEDex, a scalable method for cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis aligning human and robotic grasping kinematics, utilizing an innovative three-step process to generate a comprehensive dataset of diverse grasps for different robotic hands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots require adaptive and diverse grasp generation for versatile manipulation across varying environments, yet current approaches lack human-like kinematic understanding or demand resource-intensive manual data collection.

Method: CEDex uses a Conditional Variational Auto-encoder to generate human-like contact representations, aligns these with robot kinematics through topological merging, and optimizes grasps using a signed distance field with physics-aware constraints.

Result: The method yields the largest cross-embodiment grasp dataset (500K objects, 20M grasps) and demonstrates superior performance to contemporary techniques via evaluation experiments.

Conclusion: CEDex significantly enhances cross-embodiment grasp synthesis by bridging human and robotic kinematics, providing a scalable solution and advancing grasp learning with high-quality, diverse data.

Abstract: Cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis refers to adaptively generating
and optimizing grasps for various robotic hands with different morphologies.
This capability is crucial for achieving versatile robotic manipulation in
diverse environments and requires substantial amounts of reliable and diverse
grasp data for effective model training and robust generalization. However,
existing approaches either rely on physics-based optimization that lacks
human-like kinematic understanding or require extensive manual data collection
processes that are limited to anthropomorphic structures. In this paper, we
propose CEDex, a novel cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis method at
scale that bridges human grasping kinematics and robot kinematics by aligning
robot kinematic models with generated human-like contact representations. Given
an object's point cloud and an arbitrary robotic hand model, CEDex first
generates human-like contact representations using a Conditional Variational
Auto-encoder pretrained on human contact data. It then performs kinematic human
contact alignment through topological merging to consolidate multiple human
hand parts into unified robot components, followed by a signed distance
field-based grasp optimization with physics-aware constraints. Using CEDex, we
construct the largest cross-embodiment grasp dataset to date, comprising 500K
objects across four gripper types with 20M total grasps. Extensive experiments
show that CEDex outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and our dataset
benefits cross-embodiment grasp learning with high-quality diverse grasps.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a strategy for humanoid robot control that combines imitation learning with physics principles to create realistic, stable movements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of imitation learning methods in humanoid robots, which lack integration of physical laws and result in unrealistic, unstable motions.

Method: A dual approach integrating physics priors during supervised imitation learning to ensure feasible trajectories and applying a proportional-integral controller at inference time to minimize drift.

Result: The method improves trajectory accuracy and physical constraint adherence in real-world testing on the ergoCub humanoid robot across varied locomotion behaviors.

Conclusion: The approach enhances the stability and realism of humanoid robot movements while being compatible with multiple control systems.

Abstract: Recent trends in humanoid robot control have successfully employed imitation
learning to enable the learned generation of smooth, human-like trajectories
from human data. While these approaches make more realistic motions possible,
they are limited by the amount of available motion data, and do not incorporate
prior knowledge about the physical laws governing the system and its
interactions with the environment. Thus they may violate such laws, leading to
divergent trajectories and sliding contacts which limit real-world stability.
We address such limitations via a two-pronged learning strategy which leverages
the known physics of the system and fundamental control principles. First, we
encode physics priors during supervised imitation learning to promote
trajectory feasibility. Second, we minimize drift at inference time by applying
a proportional-integral controller directly to the generated output state. We
validate our method on various locomotion behaviors for the ergoCub humanoid
robot, where a physics-informed loss encourages zero contact foot velocity. Our
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is compatible with multiple
controllers on a real robot and significantly improves the accuracy and
physical constraint conformity of generated trajectories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for robot-human handovers often ignore the human's post-handover actions, limiting their adaptability and usability in dynamic scenarios.

Method: The proposed system uses an RGB-D image and task description to infer relevant object parts and selects task-appropriate grasps via large language models and part segmentation.

Result: The approach improved part segmentation performance, achieved a grasp success rate of 83% in hardware tests across diverse tasks, and was preferred in 86% of cases during a user study.

Conclusion: LLM-Handover effectively adapts to post-handover tasks, enabling more intuitive, context-aware collaboration between robots and humans.

Abstract: Effective human-robot collaboration depends on task-oriented handovers, where
robots present objects in ways that support the partners intended use. However,
many existing approaches neglect the humans post-handover action, relying on
assumptions that limit generalizability. To address this gap, we propose
LLM-Handover, a novel framework that integrates large language model
(LLM)-based reasoning with part segmentation to enable context-aware grasp
selection and execution. Given an RGB-D image and a task description, our
system infers relevant object parts and selects grasps that optimize
post-handover usability. To support evaluation, we introduce a new dataset of
60 household objects spanning 12 categories, each annotated with detailed part
labels. We first demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of the
used state-of-the-art part segmentation method, in the context of robot-human
handovers. Next, we show that LLM-Handover achieves higher grasp success rates
and adapts better to post-handover task constraints. During hardware
experiments, we achieve a success rate of 83% in a zero-shot setting over
conventional and unconventional post-handover tasks. Finally, our user study
underlines that our method enables more intuitive, context-aware handovers,
with participants preferring it in 86% of cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need for reliable perception systems for robots navigating dynamic environments, as single-sensor approaches (LiDAR or cameras) have limitations.

Method: APREBot combines the advantages of LiDAR-based scanning and camera-based focusing to offer hierarchical perception for real-time obstacle avoidance.

Result: APREBot shows significant improvements in obstacle avoidance performance compared to existing methods during sim-to-real evaluations.

Conclusion: APREBot enhances autonomous navigation in safety-critical robotics scenarios, providing superior safety and efficiency outcomes.

Abstract: Reliable onboard perception is critical for quadruped robots navigating
dynamic environments, where obstacles can emerge from any direction under
strict reaction-time constraints. Single-sensor systems face inherent
limitations: LiDAR provides omnidirectional coverage but lacks rich texture
information, while cameras capture high-resolution detail but suffer from
restricted field of view. We introduce APREBot (Active Perception System for
Reflexive Evasion Robot), a novel framework that integrates reflexive evasion
with active hierarchical perception. APREBot strategically combines LiDAR-based
omnidirectional scanning with camera-based active focusing, achieving
comprehensive environmental awareness essential for agile obstacle avoidance in
quadruped robots. We validate APREBot through extensive sim-to-real experiments
on a quadruped platform, evaluating diverse obstacle types, trajectories, and
approach directions. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines in both safety metrics and operational efficiency,
highlighting APREBot's potential for dependable autonomy in safety-critical
scenarios. Videos are available at https://sites.google.com/view/aprebot/

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a method, SSR-ZSON, addressing key challenges in zero-shot object navigation by enhancing semantic guidance and spatial memory through novel strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle challenges in zero-shot object navigation such as inefficient exploration due to poor semantic guidance and being stuck in local regions due to insufficient spatial memory.

Method: SSR-ZSON integrates a spatial-semantic strategy with a viewpoint generation approach focusing on semantic density and spatial coverage, combined with LLM-based global guidance for efficient navigation.

Result: The method achieved an 18.5% and 11.2% improvement in Success Rate (SR) and increased SPL by 0.181 and 0.140 across datasets like Matterport3D and Habitat-Matterport3D, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: SSR-ZSON demonstrates superior navigation performance both in simulations and physical platforms, proving its effectiveness in overcoming semantic and spatial limitations in zero-shot object navigation.

Abstract: Zero-shot object navigation in unknown environments presents significant
challenges, mainly due to two key limitations: insufficient semantic guidance
leads to inefficient exploration, while limited spatial memory resulting from
environmental structure causes entrapment in local regions. To address these
issues, we propose SSR-ZSON, a spatial-semantic relative zero-shot object
navigation method based on the TARE hierarchical exploration framework,
integrating a viewpoint generation strategy balancing spatial coverage and
semantic density with an LLM-based global guidance mechanism. The performance
improvement of the proposed method is due to two key innovations. First, the
viewpoint generation strategy prioritizes areas of high semantic density within
traversable sub-regions to maximize spatial coverage and minimize invalid
exploration. Second, coupled with an LLM-based global guidance mechanism, it
assesses semantic associations to direct navigation toward high-value spaces,
preventing local entrapment and ensuring efficient exploration. Deployed on
hybrid Habitat-Gazebo simulations and physical platforms, SSR-ZSON achieves
real-time operation and superior performance. On Matterport3D and
Habitat-Matterport3D datasets, it improves the Success Rate(SR) by 18.5\% and
11.2\%, and the Success weighted by Path Length(SPL) by 0.181 and 0.140,
respectively, over state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces IA-VLA, a framework enhancing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models by utilizing large vision-language models for preprocessing to handle semantically complex manipulation tasks, especially those involving visually indistinguishable objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLAs face challenges in understanding complex language instructions due to the limitations of small language models used for real-time robot control, necessitating improvements in language comprehension for manipulation tasks.

Method: The IA-VLA framework uses a large vision-language model for preprocessing to generate augmented context, improving the input for VLA models. It is evaluated on tasks requiring discerning visual duplicates based on complex language instructions, with a dataset comprising three scene types.

Result: The results demonstrate a significant improvement in VLA performance when using the augmentation scheme, especially in interpreting complex instructions and generalizing from demonstrated concepts.

Conclusion: The IA-VLA framework enhances the language understanding and adaptability of VLA models, enabling them to perform better in scenarios requiring nuanced interpretation of language for robot manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have become an increasingly popular
approach for addressing robot manipulation problems in recent years. However,
such models need to output actions at a rate suitable for robot control, which
limits the size of the language model they can be based on, and consequently,
their language understanding capabilities. Manipulation tasks may require
complex language instructions, such as identifying target objects by their
relative positions, to specify human intention. Therefore, we introduce IA-VLA,
a framework that utilizes the extensive language understanding of a large
vision language model as a pre-processing stage to generate improved context to
augment the input of a VLA. We evaluate the framework on a set of semantically
complex tasks which have been underexplored in VLA literature, namely tasks
involving visual duplicates, i.e., visually indistinguishable objects. A
dataset of three types of scenes with duplicate objects is used to compare a
baseline VLA against two augmented variants. The experiments show that the VLA
benefits from the augmentation scheme, especially when faced with language
instructions that require the VLA to extrapolate from concepts it has seen in
the demonstrations. For the code, dataset, and videos, see

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of shortcut learning in generalist robot policies caused by visually homogeneous training datasets, which limits their OOD generalization capabilities.

Method: The CIFT framework optimizes data composition using a proxy for Information Fidelity based on feature-space geometry, finding the Decoherence Point to balance stability. It also incorporates a generative engine (MVAug) for causally disentangled data synthesis.

Result: Applying CIFT improved out-of-distribution (OOD) success rates of robot policies like $

Conclusion: Fidelity-aware data composition is crucial for enhancing the robustness and generalization of general-purpose robot policies, beyond the use of traditional data synthesis methods.

Abstract: Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale, visually homogeneous
datasets can be susceptible to shortcut learning, which impairs their
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. While generative data augmentation is
a common approach to introduce diversity, it presents a subtle challenge: data
composition. Naively mixing real and synthetic data can corrupt the learning
signal, as this process often prioritizes visual diversity at the expense of
information fidelity. This paper suggests that robust generalization depends on
principled, fidelity-aware data composition. We introduce Coherent Information
Fidelity Tuning (CIFT), a framework that treats data composition as an
optimization problem. CIFT uses a practical proxy for Information Fidelity
based on the feature-space geometry of a dataset. This enables the
identification of a phase transition, termed the Decoherence Point, where
training stability degrades. The framework includes a generative engine,
Multi-View Video Augmentation (MVAug), to synthesize a causally disentangled
data spectrum for this tuning process. Applying CIFT to policy architectures
such as $\pi_0$ and Diffusion Policy improves OOD success rates by over 54\%.
These results indicate that fidelity-aware composition, beyond data synthesis
alone, is an important component for developing robust, general-purpose robots.

### [1122] [Finding an Initial Probe Pose in Teleoperated Robotic Echocardiography via 2D LiDAR-Based 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24867)
*Mariadas Capsran Roshan,Edgar M Hidalgo,Mats Isaksson,Michelle Dunn,Jagannatha Charjee Pyaraka*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a robot-mounted 2D LiDAR approach for automating the placement of echocardiography probes, creating 3D chest reconstructions for more efficient cardiac imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Echocardiography is critical for cardiac assessment but suffers from operator-dependence and limited access to trained professionals in underserved areas. Manual teleoperated systems are time-intensive, leading to diagnostic delays.

Method: The authors employ a robot-mounted 2D LiDAR system to reconstruct chest surfaces in 3D. They perform plane-based calibration for precise alignment and use a template-matching approach to automatically estimate the initial probe pose.

Result: The study achieved a calibration accuracy with an RMS residual of 1.8 mm and rotational uncertainty under 0.2°. Mannequin tests showed mean surface errors of 2.78±0.21 mm. Human trials yielded probe placement 20-30 mm from clinically defined points, with <4 mm variation in repeated trials.

Conclusion: This novel 2D LiDAR-based method effectively reconstructs body surfaces and enhances automation in echocardiography, suggesting a promising direction for reducing operator dependence and improving diagnostic accessibility.

Abstract: Echocardiography is a key imaging modality for cardiac assessment but remains
highly operator-dependent, and access to trained sonographers is limited in
underserved settings. Teleoperated robotic echocardiography has been proposed
as a solution; however, clinical studies report longer examination times than
manual procedures, increasing diagnostic delays and operator workload.
Automating non-expert tasks, such as automatically moving the probe to an ideal
starting pose, offers a pathway to reduce this burden. Prior vision- and
depth-based approaches to estimate an initial probe pose are sensitive to
lighting, texture, and anatomical variability. We propose a robot-mounted 2D
LiDAR-based approach that reconstructs the chest surface in 3D and estimates
the initial probe pose automatically. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first demonstration of robot-mounted 2D LiDAR used for 3D reconstruction of a
human body surface. Through plane-based extrinsic calibration, the
transformation between the LiDAR and robot base frames was estimated with an
overall root mean square (RMS) residual of 1.8 mm and rotational uncertainty
below 0.2{\deg}. The chest front surface, reconstructed from two linear LiDAR
sweeps, was aligned with non-rigid templates to identify an initial probe pose.
A mannequin-based study assessing reconstruction accuracy showed mean surface
errors of 2.78 +/- 0.21 mm. Human trials (N=5) evaluating the proposed approach
found probe initial points typically 20-30 mm from the clinically defined
initial point, while the variation across repeated trials on the same subject
was less than 4 mm.

TL;DR: This paper introduces JuggleRL, a reinforcement learning system that enables a quadrotor to perform precise aerial ball juggling, achieving unprecedented stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the challenge of aerial robots performing precise, contact-rich tasks under uncertainty, with a specific focus on ball juggling.

Method: JuggleRL uses reinforcement learning to train closed-loop policies in large-scale simulations, employing techniques like reward shaping and domain randomization to enhance robustness. The system integrates an advanced perception module and a lightweight communication protocol for real-time control.

Result: JuggleRL achieves an average of 311 hits over 10 trials, vastly outperforming a model-based baseline. It also generalizes to successfully juggle a lighter ball with an average of 145.9 hits.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that reinforcement learning can enable aerial robots to excel in dynamic interaction tasks, demonstrating robust and stable control in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Aerial robots interacting with objects must perform precise, contact-rich
maneuvers under uncertainty. In this paper, we study the problem of aerial ball
juggling using a quadrotor equipped with a racket, a task that demands accurate
timing, stable control, and continuous adaptation. We propose JuggleRL, the
first reinforcement learning-based system for aerial juggling. It learns
closed-loop policies in large-scale simulation using systematic calibration of
quadrotor and ball dynamics to reduce the sim-to-real gap. The training
incorporates reward shaping to encourage racket-centered hits and sustained
juggling, as well as domain randomization over ball position and coefficient of
restitution to enhance robustness and transferability. The learned policy
outputs mid-level commands executed by a low-level controller and is deployed
zero-shot on real hardware, where an enhanced perception module with a
lightweight communication protocol reduces delays in high-frequency state
estimation and ensures real-time control. Experiments show that JuggleRL
achieves an average of $311$ hits over $10$ consecutive trials in the real
world, with a maximum of $462$ hits observed, far exceeding a model-based
baseline that reaches at most $14$ hits with an average of $3.1$. Moreover, the
policy generalizes to unseen conditions, successfully juggling a lighter $5$ g
ball with an average of $145.9$ hits. This work demonstrates that reinforcement
learning can empower aerial robots with robust and stable control in dynamic
interaction tasks.

TL;DR: This paper presents DRCP, a cooperative perception framework leveraging advanced modules to improve detection accuracy and robustness for autonomous vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in real-world deployments of cooperative perception characterized by partial detections and noise accumulation.

Method: DRCP integrates a cross-modal cooperative perception module for improved feature fusion and a diffusion-based refinement module to enhance feature robustness.

Result: The system achieves real-time performance and significant robustness improvements under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: DRCP addresses hard detection challenges in dynamic environments, paving the way for better accuracy in cooperative perception for autonomous systems.

Abstract: Cooperative perception enabled by Vehicle-to-Everything communication has
shown great promise in enhancing situational awareness for autonomous vehicles
and other mobile robotic platforms. Despite recent advances in perception
backbones and multi-agent fusion, real-world deployments remain challenged by
hard detection cases, exemplified by partial detections and noise accumulation
which limit downstream detection accuracy. This work presents Diffusion on
Reinforced Cooperative Perception (DRCP), a real-time deployable framework
designed to address aforementioned issues in dynamic driving environments. DRCP
integrates two key components: (1) Precise-Pyramid-Cross-Modality-Cross-Agent,
a cross-modal cooperative perception module that leverages
camera-intrinsic-aware angular partitioning for attention-based fusion and
adaptive convolution to better exploit external features; and (2)
Mask-Diffusion-Mask-Aggregation, a novel lightweight diffusion-based refinement
module that encourages robustness against feature perturbations and aligns
bird's-eye-view features closer to the task-optimal manifold. The proposed
system achieves real-time performance on mobile platforms while significantly
improving robustness under challenging conditions. Code will be released in
late 2025.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for recognizing human group interactions using RGB-D cameras to enhance socially aware navigation for robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social robots require understanding of human interactions for seamless integration in shared environments, filling a gap left by conventional systems focusing only on obstacle avoidance.

Method: The approach uses 3D keypoint estimation from RGB-D data, PCA for interaction direction detection, and the shoelace formula for identifying engagement areas. It runs efficiently on a single-board computer and is packaged for ROS 2.

Result: Experiments demonstrate successful recognition of group interactions across variable scenarios and a fast processing speed of 4 ms per frame.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a practical, high-speed solution for socially aware navigation and is easily integrable due to its ROS 2 package and open-source availability.

Abstract: {Recognizing human interactions is essential for social robots as it enables
them to navigate safely and naturally in shared environments. Conventional
robotic systems however often focus on obstacle avoidance, neglecting social
cues necessary for seamless human-robot interaction. To address this gap, we
propose a framework to recognize human group interactions for socially aware
navigation. Our method utilizes color and depth frames from a monocular RGB-D
camera to estimate 3D human keypoints and positions. Principal component
analysis (PCA) is then used to determine dominant interaction directions. The
shoelace formula is finally applied to compute interest points and engagement
areas. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the validity of
the proposed method. The results show that our method is capable of recognizing
group interactions across different scenarios with varying numbers of
individuals. It also achieves high-speed performance, processing each frame in
approximately 4 ms on a single-board computer used in robotic systems. The
method is implemented as a ROS 2 package making it simple to integrate into
existing navigation systems. Source code is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a hierarchical framework combining vision-language models and diffusion policies for better generalization and imitation in robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic imitation learning struggles with generalization and limited data, especially in complex and long-horizon scenarios.

Method: A hierarchical framework using vision-language models to decompose tasks into modular subroutines coupled with diffusion policies for imitating behavior, along with a memory mechanism for non-Markovian tasks.

Result: The proposed approach improves policy decomposition, enhances generalization, and enables separate evaluation of planning and control components.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the challenges of robotic imitation learning efficiency and interpretability in task execution.

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation often suffers from limited
generalization and data scarcity, especially in complex, long-horizon tasks. In
this work, we introduce a hierarchical framework that leverages code-generating
vision-language models (VLMs) in combination with low-level diffusion policies
to effectively imitate and generalize robotic behavior. Our key insight is to
treat open-source robotic APIs not only as execution interfaces but also as
sources of structured supervision: the associated subtask functions - when
exposed - can serve as modular, semantically meaningful labels. We train a VLM
to decompose task descriptions into executable subroutines, which are then
grounded through a diffusion policy trained to imitate the corresponding robot
behavior. To handle the non-Markovian nature of both code execution and certain
real-world tasks, such as object swapping, our architecture incorporates a
memory mechanism that maintains subtask context across time. We find that this
design enables interpretable policy decomposition, improves generalization when
compared to flat policies and enables separate evaluation of high-level
planning and low-level control.

TL;DR: CineWild is an autonomous UAV framework designed for wildlife documentary filmmaking that prioritizes both cinematic quality and animal welfare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drones in wildlife documentaries can provide unique perspectives but also risk disturbing animals. The paper aims to address the ethical concerns while improving cinematic quality.

Method: The framework uses model predictive control to dynamically adjust flight paths, camera settings, and employs adaptive zoom, path-planning, and smooth maneuvers to minimize disturbance.

Result: The CineWild system was validated through simulation studies and showed promise in achieving its dual objectives.

Conclusion: CineWild represents an interdisciplinary effort merging robotics, filmmaking, and ethics to enhance wildlife documentary creation responsibly.

Abstract: Drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have become powerful tools across
domains-from industry to the arts. In documentary filmmaking, they offer
dynamic, otherwise unreachable perspectives, transforming how stories are told.
Wildlife documentaries especially benefit, yet drones also raise ethical
concerns: the risk of disturbing the animals they aim to capture. This paper
introduces CineWild, an autonomous UAV framework that combines robotics,
cinematography, and ethics. Built on model predictive control, CineWild
dynamically adjusts flight paths and camera settings to balance cinematic
quality with animal welfare. Key features include adaptive zoom for filming
from acoustic and visual safe distances, path-planning that avoids an animal's
field of view, and smooth, low-noise maneuvers. CineWild exemplifies
interdisciplinary innovation-bridging engineering, visual storytelling, and
environmental ethics. We validate the system through simulation studies and
will release the code upon acceptance.

*Shunan Yin,Zehui Lu,Shaoshuai Mou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents an adaptive Bayesian algorithm for real-time trajectory prediction, ensuring robustness against sudden changes in target intentions and motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of real-time trajectory prediction under conditions where the target's intentions and motion traits are unknown and variable.

Method: The algorithm estimates a target's intention (Markovian latent state) and how closely it follows a shortest-path policy. Using these dynamic updates, it predicts paths with quantified uncertainty through a sampling-based method.

Result: Experimental results, including Monte Carlo trials and hardware demonstrations, show the method's superiority over other approaches. It operates at 270 Hz without requiring training or comprehensive target behavior data.

Conclusion: The adaptive Bayesian algorithm provides an effective, real-time solution for trajectory prediction, making it highly suitable for diverse robotic applications.

Abstract: This work introduces an adaptive Bayesian algorithm for real-time trajectory
prediction via intention inference, where a target's intentions and motion
characteristics are unknown and subject to change. The method concurrently
estimates two critical variables: the target's current intention, modeled as a
Markovian latent state, and an intention parameter that describes the target's
adherence to a shortest-path policy. By integrating this joint update
technique, the algorithm maintains robustness against abrupt intention shifts
and unknown motion dynamics. A sampling-based trajectory prediction mechanism
then exploits these adaptive estimates to generate probabilistic forecasts with
quantified uncertainty. We validate the framework through numerical
experiments: Ablation studies of two cases, and a 500-trial Monte Carlo
analysis; Hardware demonstrations on quadrotor and quadrupedal platforms.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly
outperforms non-adaptive and partially adaptive methods. The method operates in
real time around 270 Hz without requiring training or detailed prior knowledge
of target behavior, showcasing its applicability in various robotic systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces World-Env, a reinforcement learning framework for Vision-Language-Action models, which addresses challenges of limited training data and real-world constraints by using a virtual simulator instead of physical interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation-trained Vision-Language-Action models struggle with data scarcity and real-world non-resettable environments, making reinforcement learning challenging in high-risk domains like industrial automation.

Method: World-Env uses a virtual world simulator to enable safe RL post-training. It includes a video-based world model for visual observation prediction and a vision-language instant reflector for reward and termination signals.

Result: World-Env achieves significant performance improvements, needing only five expert demonstrations per task, and successfully handles complex robotic manipulation tasks in a safe and data-efficient manner.

Conclusion: World-Env offers a scalable solution for enhancing VLA model performance while overcoming the limitations of data inefficiency, safety issues, and redundant actions, especially for resource-constrained domains.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained via imitation learning suffer
from significant performance degradation in data-scarce scenarios due to their
reliance on large-scale demonstration datasets. Although reinforcement learning
(RL)-based post-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity, its
application to VLA models is hindered by the non-resettable nature of
real-world environments. This limitation is particularly critical in high-risk
domains such as industrial automation, where interactions often induce state
changes that are costly or infeasible to revert. Furthermore, existing VLA
approaches lack a reliable mechanism for detecting task completion, leading to
redundant actions that reduce overall task success rates. To address these
challenges, we propose World-Env, an RL-based post-training framework that
replaces physical interaction with a low-cost, world model-based virtual
simulator. World-Env consists of two key components: (1) a video-based world
simulator that generates temporally consistent future visual observations, and
(2) a vision-language model (VLM)-guided instant reflector that provides
continuous reward signals and predicts action termination. This simulated
environment enables VLA models to safely explore and generalize beyond their
initial imitation learning distribution. Our method achieves notable
performance gains with as few as five expert demonstrations per task.
Experiments on complex robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that World-Env
effectively overcomes the data inefficiency, safety constraints, and
inefficient execution of conventional VLA models that rely on real-world
interaction, offering a practical and scalable solution for post-training in
resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MSG, an inference framework that combines multiple policies to enhance sample efficiency and performance in robot policy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative robot policies offer flexibility but suffer from sample inefficiency, which hinders practical applicability.

Method: Proposes MSG, a model-agnostic inference-time framework that trains multiple object-centric policies and composes them during inference to enhance efficiency and generalization.

Result: Demonstrates a 95% reduction in sample requirements and an 89% performance improvement compared to single-stream approaches through simulation and real robot experiments.

Conclusion: MSG provides a notable performance boost and sample efficiency, enables zero-shot object instance transfer, and is applicable across various settings, with the code made publicly available for replication.

Abstract: Generative robot policies such as Flow Matching offer flexible, multi-modal
policy learning but are sample-inefficient. Although object-centric policies
improve sample efficiency, it does not resolve this limitation. In this work,
we propose Multi-Stream Generative Policy (MSG), an inference-time composition
framework that trains multiple object-centric policies and combines them at
inference to improve generalization and sample efficiency. MSG is
model-agnostic and inference-only, hence widely applicable to various
generative policies and training paradigms. We perform extensive experiments
both in simulation and on a real robot, demonstrating that our approach learns
high-quality generative policies from as few as five demonstrations, resulting
in a 95% reduction in demonstrations, and improves policy performance by 89
percent compared to single-stream approaches. Furthermore, we present
comprehensive ablation studies on various composition strategies and provide
practical recommendations for deployment. Finally, MSG enables zero-shot object
instance transfer. We make our code publicly available at

Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current one-shot imitation learning approaches, which struggle with long-horizon, multi-step tasks and often require extra model training or manual intervention.

Method: The paper introduces a novel methodology applied to single demonstrations, utilizing pre-trained feature extractors to enable transfer of multi-step and single-step manipulation skills.

Result: The proposed method achieved an average success rate of 82.5% on multi-step tasks and 90% on single-step tasks, outperforming existing baselines in both accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates significant advancements in one-shot imitation learning for both single-step and multi-step tasks, providing a scalable solution for skill acquisition without additional training or annotation.

Abstract: Recent advances in one-shot imitation learning have enabled robots to acquire
new manipulation skills from a single human demonstration. While existing
methods achieve strong performance on single-step tasks, they remain limited in
their ability to handle long-horizon, multi-step tasks without additional model
training or manual annotation. We propose a method that can be applied to this
setting provided a single demonstration without additional model training or
manual annotation. We evaluated our method on multi-step and single-step
manipulation tasks where our method achieves an average success rate of 82.5%
and 90%, respectively. Our method matches and exceeds the performance of the
baselines in both these cases. We also compare the performance and
computational efficiency of alternative pre-trained feature extractors within

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Path Diffuser (PD), a diffusion-based approach to simulate diverse and realistic traffic scenarios for autonomous planning without historical agent trajectory data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop realistic traffic simulations for improving autonomous planning, overcoming limitations of traditional and learning-based simulators that rely on historical trajectory data.

Method: Path Diffuser generates agent pose initializations and trajectories conditioned on map data using a diffusion model. It incorporates Frenet frame motion primitives to ensure diverse, road-compliant trajectories and models multi-agent interactions effectively.

Result: Path Diffuser outperforms baselines in distribution metrics (1.92x), common-sense metrics (1.14x), and road compliance (1.62x) on adversarial benchmarks and generalizes well to out-of-distribution maps.

Conclusion: Path Diffuser is capable of generating realistic and diverse traffic scenarios without historical trajectory dependency, providing a scalable solution for autonomous planning simulations.

Abstract: Simulating diverse and realistic traffic scenarios is critical for developing
and testing autonomous planning. Traditional rule-based planners lack diversity
and realism, while learning-based simulators often replay, forecast, or edit
scenarios using historical agent trajectories. However, they struggle to
generate new scenarios, limiting scalability and diversity due to their
reliance on fully annotated logs and historical data. Thus, a key challenge for
a learning-based simulator's performance is that it requires agents' past
trajectories and pose information in addition to map data, which might not be
available for all agents on the road.Without which, generated scenarios often
produce unrealistic trajectories that deviate from drivable areas, particularly
under out-of-distribution (OOD) map scenes (e.g., curved roads). To address
this, we propose Path Diffuser (PD): a two-stage, diffusion model for
generating agent pose initializations and their corresponding trajectories
conditioned on the map, free of any historical context of agents' trajectories.
Furthermore, PD incorporates a motion primitive-based prior, leveraging Frenet
frame candidate trajectories to enhance diversity while ensuring road-compliant
trajectory generation. We also explore various design choices for modeling
complex multi-agent interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method through extensive experiments on the Argoverse2 Dataset and additionally
evaluate the generalizability of the approach on OOD map variants. Notably,
Path Diffuser outperforms the baseline methods by 1.92x on distribution
metrics, 1.14x on common-sense metrics, and 1.62x on road compliance from
adversarial benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing datasets for mobile manipulation, which lack synchronized force-torque sensing, hierarchical annotations, and explicit failure cases, and to enable the development of reliable robots in human environments.

Method: The authors collected 25,469 real-world episodes (~94 hours) using the Human Support Robot (HSR), integrating multimodal data (e.g., RGB images, wrist force-torque signals) and annotating tasks with sub-goals and primitive actions for hierarchical learning.

Result: The dataset provides synchronized multimodal data for mobile manipulation, hierarchical task annotations, and error analysis capabilities, filling a void in current datasets.

Conclusion: AIRoA MoMa is a significant benchmark resource for advancing Vision-Language-Action models, supporting contact-rich and long-horizon robotics tasks in unstructured environments.

Abstract: As robots transition from controlled settings to unstructured human
environments, building generalist agents that can reliably follow natural
language instructions remains a central challenge. Progress in robust mobile
manipulation requires large-scale multimodal datasets that capture contact-rich
and long-horizon tasks, yet existing resources lack synchronized force-torque
sensing, hierarchical annotations, and explicit failure cases. We address this
gap with the AIRoA MoMa Dataset, a large-scale real-world multimodal dataset
for mobile manipulation. It includes synchronized RGB images, joint states,
six-axis wrist force-torque signals, and internal robot states, together with a
novel two-layer annotation schema of sub-goals and primitive actions for
hierarchical learning and error analysis. The initial dataset comprises 25,469
episodes (approx. 94 hours) collected with the Human Support Robot (HSR) and is
fully standardized in the LeRobot v2.1 format. By uniquely integrating mobile
manipulation, contact-rich interaction, and long-horizon structure, AIRoA MoMa
provides a critical benchmark for advancing the next generation of
Vision-Language-Action models. The first version of our dataset is now

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgriCruiser, an open-source agricultural robot designed for cost-effective weed management and adaptability across diverse crops, with promising performance and affordability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for cost-effective, adaptable solutions for agricultural tasks like weed management in diverse crop and row layouts.

Method: Developed AgriCruiser, an adjustable robotic platform integrated with precision spraying to validate weed management in flax plots and tested mobility across different terrains.

Result: AgriCruiser reduced weed populations by 24- to 42-fold with minimal crop damage compared to manual weeding while achieving reliable performance across various terrains.

Conclusion: AgriCruiser demonstrates that low-cost, customizable agricultural robotics can enhance weed management, reduce labor, and serve as versatile tools for other applications.

Abstract: We present the AgriCruiser, an open-source over-the-row agricultural robot
developed for low-cost deployment and rapid adaptation across diverse crops and
row layouts. The chassis provides an adjustable track width of 1.42 m to 1.57
m, along with a ground clearance of 0.94 m. The AgriCruiser achieves compact
pivot turns with radii of 0.71 m to 0.79 m, enabling efficient headland
maneuvers. The platform is designed for the integration of the other
subsystems, and in this study, a precision spraying system was implemented to
assess its effectiveness in weed management. In twelve flax plots, a single
robotic spray pass reduced total weed populations (pigweed and Venice mallow)
by 24- to 42-fold compared to manual weeding in four flax plots, while also
causing less crop damage. Mobility experiments conducted on concrete, asphalt,
gravel, grass, and both wet and dry soil confirmed reliable traversal
consistent with torque sizing. The complete chassis can be constructed from
commodity T-slot extrusion with minimal machining, resulting in a bill of
materials costing approximately $5,000 - $6,000, which enables replication and
customization. The mentioned results demonstrate that low-cost, reconfigurable
over-the-row robots can achieve effective weed management with reduced crop

### [1135] [Crop Spirals: Re-thinking the field layout for future robotic agriculture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25091)
*Lakshan Lavan,Lanojithan Thiyagarasa,Udara Muthugala,Rajitha de Silva*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a robot-centric square spiral crop layout optimized for robotic navigation, demonstrating improved efficiency in simulation and multi-robot coordination compared to traditional linear layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the inefficiency in robotic navigation caused by conventional linear crop layouts originally optimized for tractors.

Method: A square spiral layout with a central tramline is proposed. The authors integrate DH-ResNet18 waypoint regression, pixel-to-odometry mapping, A* planning, and model predictive control into a navigation stack to leverage this layout.

Result: Simulations show up to 28% shorter paths and 25% faster execution in waypoint tasks compared to linear layouts. Multi-robot coordination tests achieve up to 33-37% lower batch completion times.

Conclusion: Redesigning field geometry to a robot-centric layout can enhance autonomous agricultural efficiency significantly, supporting the transition to robotics-focused approaches.

Abstract: Conventional linear crop layouts, optimised for tractors, hinder robotic
navigation with tight turns, long travel distances, and perceptual aliasing. We
propose a robot-centric square spiral layout with a central tramline, enabling
simpler motion and more efficient coverage. To exploit this geometry, we
develop a navigation stack combining DH-ResNet18 waypoint regression,
pixel-to-odometry mapping, A* planning, and model predictive control (MPC). In
simulations, the spiral layout yields up to 28% shorter paths and about 25%
faster execution for waypoint-based tasks across 500 waypoints than linear
layouts, while full-field coverage performance is comparable to an optimised
linear U-turn strategy. Multi-robot studies demonstrate efficient coordination
on the spirals rule-constrained graph, with a greedy allocator achieving 33-37%
lower batch completion times than a Hungarian assignment under our setup. These
results highlight the potential of redesigning field geometry to better suit
autonomous agriculture.

### [1136] [Curriculum Imitation Learning of Distributed Multi-Robot Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25097)
*Jesús Roche,Eduardo Sebastián,Eduardo Montijano*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in training multi-robot systems (MRS) by developing a curriculum learning method for coordination and a perceptual estimation approach for generating distributed policies using global state demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the difficulties in long-term coordination and the lack of realistic training data for multi-robot systems (MRS) control policy learning.

Method: They propose a curriculum learning strategy that progressively extends expert trajectory lengths to improve coordination and introduce a method to approximate each robot's egocentric perception from global state data.

Result: The experiments demonstrated that the curriculum learning approach enhances long-term behavior accuracy, and the perceptual estimation technique improves robustness to uncertainty in distributed policies.

Conclusion: The integration of these strategies effectively enables scalable, robust control policy learning for multi-robot systems, even without expert actions or direct onboard measurements.

Abstract: Learning control policies for multi-robot systems (MRS) remains a major
challenge due to long-term coordination and the difficulty of obtaining
realistic training data. In this work, we address both limitations within an
imitation learning framework. First, we shift the typical role of Curriculum
Learning in MRS, from scalability with the number of robots, to focus on
improving long-term coordination. We propose a curriculum strategy that
gradually increases the length of expert trajectories during training,
stabilizing learning and enhancing the accuracy of long-term behaviors. Second,
we introduce a method to approximate the egocentric perception of each robot
using only third-person global state demonstrations. Our approach transforms
idealized trajectories into locally available observations by filtering
neighbors, converting reference frames, and simulating onboard sensor
variability. Both contributions are integrated into a physics-informed
technique to produce scalable, distributed policies from observations. We
conduct experiments across two tasks with varying team sizes and noise levels.
Results show that our curriculum improves long-term accuracy, while our
perceptual estimation method yields policies that are robust to realistic
uncertainty. Together, these strategies enable the learning of robust,
distributed controllers from global demonstrations, even in the absence of
expert actions or onboard measurements.

### [1137] [Safe Planning in Unknown Environments using Conformalized Semantic Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25124)
*David Smith Sundarsingh,Yifei Li,Tianji Tang,George J. Pappas,Nikolay Atanasov,Yiannis Kantaros*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semantic planning algorithm for robots in unknown environments with perceptual uncertainty, achieving user-defined task success rates without requiring prior sensor model knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for robust semantic planning in unknown environments under perceptual uncertainty, as existing methods lack correctness guarantees or rely on detailed sensor models.

Method: The paper uses conformal prediction to quantify semantic map uncertainty during on-the-fly construction, enabling model- and distribution-free mission planning.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that this approach surpasses baselines in ensuring mission success rates, validating both the method and its theoretical foundations.

Conclusion: The proposed planner effectively handles perceptual uncertainty and provides guaranteed task success rates without needing prior sensor information, advancing robust semantic planning capability.

Abstract: This paper addresses semantic planning problems in unknown environments under
perceptual uncertainty. The environment contains multiple unknown semantically
labeled regions or objects, and the robot must reach desired locations while
maintaining class-dependent distances from them. We aim to compute robot paths
that complete such semantic reach-avoid tasks with user-defined probability
despite uncertain perception. Existing planning algorithms either ignore
perceptual uncertainty - thus lacking correctness guarantees - or assume known
sensor models and noise characteristics. In contrast, we present the first
planner for semantic reach-avoid tasks that achieves user-specified mission
completion rates without requiring any knowledge of sensor models or noise.
This is enabled by quantifying uncertainty in semantic maps - constructed
on-the-fly from perceptual measurements - using conformal prediction in a
model- and distribution-free manner. We validate our approach and the
theoretical mission completion rates through extensive experiments, showing
that it consistently outperforms baselines in mission success rates.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces the largest benchmark for generating formally verified code from formal specifications, contrasting it with the generation of potentially buggy code from natural language descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the generation of formally verified code using LLMs and provide a benchmark to evaluate their capabilities.

Method: The benchmark contains over 12,500 formal specifications across different programming and verification languages, with tests conducted for success rates using off-the-shelf LLMs.

Result: Success rates for generating verified code were found to be 27% for Lean, 44% for Verus/Rust, and 82% for Dafny. Progress in Dafny verification improved over the past year from 68% to 96%.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in generating formally verified code, signifying progress but also highlighting areas requiring further improvement.

Abstract: We present and test the largest benchmark for vericoding, LLM-generation of
formally verified code from formal specifications - in contrast to vibe coding,
which generates potentially buggy code from a natural language description. Our
benchmark contains 12,504 formal specifications, with 3,029 in Dafny, 2,334 in
Verus/Rust and 7,141 in Lean. Of these, 6,174 are new unseen problems. We find
vericoding success rates of 27% in Lean, 44% in Verus/Rust and 82% in Dafny
using off-the-shelf LLMs. Adding natural-language descriptions does not
significantly improve performance. We also find that LLM progress has improved
progress on pure Dafny verification from 68% to 96% over the past year. The
benchmark and vericoding results are shared at

### [1139] [Towards Human-interpretable Explanation in Code Clone Detection using LLM-based Post Hoc Explainer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22978)
*Teeradaj Racharak,Chaiyong Ragkhitwetsagul,Chayanee Junplong,Akara Supratak*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study proposes using large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT-4, to explain predictions made by ML-based code clone detectors like GraphCodeBERT, achieving high accuracy and usefulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of interpretability in ML-based code clone detectors, which often function as black boxes, by developing more effective post hoc explanation techniques.

Method: The paper utilizes the in-context learning capabilities of ChatGPT-4 to interpret the predictions of GraphCodeBERT. The study also investigates the impact of changing the temperature parameter on explanation accuracy.

Result: The proposed approach provides correct explanations up to 98% of the time and good explanations 95% of the time. Lowering the temperature to zero improved explanation accuracy.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of using LLMs as effective post hoc explainers for ML models in software engineering tasks, paving the way for their future adoption and improvement.

Abstract: Recent studies highlight various machine learning (ML)-based techniques for
code clone detection, which can be integrated into developer tools such as
static code analysis. With the advancements brought by ML in code
understanding, ML-based code clone detectors could accurately identify and
classify cloned pairs, especially semantic clones, but often operate as black
boxes, providing little insight into the decision-making process. Post hoc
explainers, on the other hand, aim to interpret and explain the predictions of
these ML models after they are made, offering a way to understand the
underlying mechanisms driving the model's decisions. However, current post hoc
techniques require white-box access to the ML model or are computationally
expensive, indicating a need for advanced post hoc explainers. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach that leverages the in-context learning capabilities
of large language models to elucidate the predictions made by the ML-based code
clone detectors. We perform a study using ChatGPT-4 to explain the code clone
results inferred by GraphCodeBERT. We found that our approach is promising as a
post hoc explainer by giving the correct explanations up to 98% and offering
good explanations 95% of the time. However, the explanations and the code line
examples given by the LLM are useful in some cases. We also found that lowering
the temperature to zero helps increase the accuracy of the explanation. Lastly,
we list the insights that can lead to further improvements in future work. This
study paves the way for future studies in using LLMs as a post hoc explainer
for various software engineering tasks.

TL;DR: The study evaluates how AI-assisted programming influences software development dynamics, uncovering the Matthew effect where popular languages/frameworks create better LLM-generated outcomes, potentially hampering diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the broader implications of LLM-driven programming on the iterative dynamics of software engineering and its impact on programming ecosystems.

Method: Large-scale experiments were conducted on thousands of algorithmic programming tasks and hundreds of framework selection tasks to examine the interaction between AI-assisted programming and the software ecosystem.

Result: The research identified that LLM-generated code performs better with popular programming languages/frameworks, demonstrating a Matthew effect that reinforces existing popularity hierarchies.

Conclusion: AI-assisted programming, while enhancing productivity, may accelerate the dominance of widely-used tools, limiting diversity and innovation in programming ecosystems.

Abstract: AI-assisted programming is rapidly reshaping software development, with large
language models (LLMs) enabling new paradigms such as vibe coding and agentic
coding. While prior works have focused on prompt design and code generation
quality, the broader impact of LLM-driven development on the iterative dynamics
of software engineering remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct
large-scale experiments on thousands of algorithmic programming tasks and
hundreds of framework selection tasks to systematically investigate how
AI-assisted programming interacts with the software ecosystem. Our analysis
reveals \textbf{a striking Matthew effect: the more popular a programming
language or framework, the higher the success rate of LLM-generated code}. The
phenomenon suggests that AI systems may reinforce existing popularity
hierarchies, accelerating convergence around dominant tools while hindering
diversity and innovation. We provide a quantitative characterization of this
effect and discuss its implications for the future evolution of programming
ecosystems.

*Anthony Savidis,Christos Vasilopoulos*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents an innovative software visualization approach to improve source code comprehension and system analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facilitating comprehension, analysis, and evolution of complex software systems through graphical visualization techniques.

Method: The approach involves a configurable grouping mechanism, integration of fine-grained and coarse-grained metrics for multi-level analysis, and an interactive visualization engine for dynamic adjustments.

Result: The method provides adaptable software visualizations that enhance the ability of engineers to detect patterns, identify complexities, and infer behaviors effectively.

Conclusion: A novel method in software visualization empowers developers with better tools for understanding, analyzing, and maintaining large-scale systems.

Abstract: Software visualization seeks to represent software artifacts graphical-ly in
two or three dimensions, with the goal of enhancing comprehension, anal-ysis,
maintenance, and evolution of the source code. In this context, visualiza-tions
employ graphical forms such as dependency structures, treemaps, or time-lines
that incorporate repository histories. These visualizations allow software
engineers to identify structural patterns, detect complexity hotspots, and
infer system behaviors that are difficult to perceive directly from source
text. By adopting metaphor-based approaches, visualization tools provide
macroscopic overviews while enabling focused inspection of specific program
elements, thus offering an accessible means of understanding large-scale
systems. The contri-bution of our work lies in three areas. First, we introduce
a configurable group-ing mechanism that supports flexible organization of code
elements based on arbitrary relationships. Second, we combine fine-grained and
coarse-grained software metrics to provide a multi-level perspective on system
properties. Third, we present an interactive visualization engine that allows
developers to dynamically adjust rendering attributes. Collectively, these
advances provide a more adaptable and insightful approach to source code
comprehension.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Paper proposes a detailed and practical methodology for software accessibility evaluation, focusing on inclusivity for users with visual impairments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of generalized accessibility evaluation methods and develop a tailored approach for specific user needs.

Method: Developed a classification, mathematical model, and accessibility assessment method targeting visual impairments, and analyzed a university website.

Result: A website inclusivity analysis was conducted, highlighting areas for improvement and delivering specific recommendations.

Conclusion: Proposed methodology provides more granular insights into accessibility, enhancing digital inclusivity by identifying and addressing barriers.

Abstract: The development and enhancement of methods for evaluating software
accessibility is a relevant challenge in modern software engineering, as
ensuring equal access to digital services is a key factor in improving their
efficiency and inclusivity. The increasing digitalization of society
necessitates the creation of software that complies with international
accessibility standards such as ISO/IEC 25023 and WCAG. Adhering to these
standards helps eliminate barriers to software use for individuals with diverse
physical, sensory, and cognitive needs. Despite advancements in regulatory
frameworks, existing accessibility evaluation methodologies are often
generalized and fail to account for the specific needs of different user
categories or the unique ways they interact with digital systems. This
highlights the need for the development of new, more detailed methods for
defining metrics that influence the quality of user interaction with software
products. Building a classification and mathematical model and developing
accessibility assessment methods for software based on it. A method for
assessing the quality subcharacteristic "Accessibility", which is part of the
"Usability" quality characteristic, has been developed. This enabled the
analysis of a website's inclusivity for individuals with visual impairments,
and the formulation of specific recommendations for further improvements, which
is a crucial step toward creating an inclusive digital environment. Comparing
to standardized approaches, a more detailed and practically oriented
accessibility assessment methodology has been proposed. Using this methodology,
an analysis of the accessibility of the main pages of Vasyl Stefanyk
Precarpathian National University's website was conducted, and improvements
were suggested to enhance its inclusivity.

*Spandan Garg,Roshanak Zilouchian Moghaddam*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces PerfBench, a benchmark for evaluating coding agents’ ability to fix performance bugs, revealing current agents underperform in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing coding benchmarks neglect performance bugs, which are inefficiencies in software that waste resources without causing functional failures.

Method: PerfBench includes 81 real-world performance bug-fixing tasks, allowing agents to create and validate their own benchmarks based on execution metrics.

Result: State-of-the-art coding agents achieve low success rates (~3%), while OpenHands-Perf-Agent improves this to ~20%, showing significant but limited improvement.

Conclusion: PerfBench highlights gaps in agents’ abilities to fix performance bugs and offers a meaningful test set for driving advancements in this area.

Abstract: Performance bugs are inefficiencies in software that waste computational
resources without causing functional failures, making them particularly
challenging to detect and fix. While recent advances in Software Engineering
agents have shown promise in automated bug fixing, existing benchmarks
primarily focus on functional correctness and fail to evaluate agents'
abilities to identify and resolve non-functional issues like performance bugs.
We introduce PerfBench, a benchmark comprising 81 real-world performance
bug-fixing tasks from popular .NET repositories on GitHub. Unlike existing
benchmarks that rely on pre-existing test suites, PerfBench features a novel
evaluation harness that allows agents to generate their own performance
benchmarks and validates fixes by comparing execution metrics collected for
developer fix and agent fix. Each task in PerfBench is derived from actual
developer fixes linked to performance-related issues, which are then verified
by human experts, ensuring real-world relevance. Our evaluation reveals that
current state-of-the-art coding agents struggle with performance optimization
tasks, with baseline OpenHands agent achieving only a ~3% success rate on our
benchmark. We develop OpenHands-Perf-Agent, which incorporates
performance-aware tooling and instructions and achieves a ~20% success rate on
the benchmark. We show that by ensuring the agent has proper instructions to
benchmark its changes and tooling for benchmark output processing, we can
improve the agent performance significantly, but room for improvement still
remains. PerfBench provides a challenging test set for furthering the
capabilities of agents in fixing performance issues.

*Yuan-An Xiao,Pengfei Gao,Chao Peng,Yingfei Xiong*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'AgentDiet,' a method to reduce computational costs by automatically removing redundant and expired information in multi-turn agent systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving significant token reduction without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-turn LLM-based agent systems for software engineering tasks face high computational inefficiency due to excessive and redundant input tokens in prolonged trajectories.

Method: AgentDiet is a trajectory reduction approach that analyzes agent trajectories to identify and remove useless, redundant, or expired information during inference-time, ensuring no harm to agent performance.

Result: AgentDiet achieved a token input reduction of 39.9% to 59.7% and a computational cost reduction of 21.1% to 35.9% on two LLMs and benchmarks, while maintaining the same level of performance.

Conclusion: Trajectory reduction, as demonstrated by AgentDiet, is a promising method to improve the efficiency of LLM-based agent systems without performance degradation.

Abstract: Multi-turn agent systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have been
increasingly popular for software engineering tasks. While LLM agents show
decent effectiveness, the high computational cost of input tokens due to the
ever-growing trajectory remains an efficiency concern for their applications.
Efficiency is largely neglected in existing studies and agent products, and
this paper fills the gap by introducing an inference-time trajectory reduction
approach to reduce the cost of agents.
  Through analyzing existing agent trajectories, we demonstrate that useless,
redundant, and expired information is widespread in all trajectories, which can
be identified and reduced without harming the agent's performance. We then
design a simple yet effective trajectory reduction approach, AgentDiet, which
automatically removes such waste information. We implement AgentDiet on a
top-performing coding agent, and the evaluation on two LLMs and two benchmarks
shows that AgentDiet can reduce input tokens by 39.9% ~ 59.7%, or the final
computational cost by 21.1% ~ 35.9%, while maintaining the same agent
performance. This indicates that trajectory reduction is a promising direction
for agent systems.

Motivation: Existing LLM-based tools focus on mainstream languages, leaving emerging verification-oriented languages like Move underexplored.

Method: The paper presents MSG, an automated tool using LLMs with agentic and modular design, and integrates feedback from the verification toolchain.

Result: MSG successfully generates verifiable specifications for 84% of tested Move functions, identifies overlooked clauses, and improves quality and effectiveness of specifications by leveraging language features and feedback.

Conclusion: MSG demonstrates the potential of LLMs for high-quality specification generation in non-mainstream languages, advancing both verification and programming ecosystems.

Abstract: While LLM-based specification generation is gaining traction, existing tools
primarily focus on mainstream programming languages like C, Java, and even
Solidity, leaving emerging and yet verification-oriented languages like Move
underexplored. In this paper, we introduce MSG, an automated specification
generation tool designed for Move smart contracts. MSG aims to highlight key
insights that uniquely present when applying LLM-based specification generation
to a new ecosystem. Specifically, MSG demonstrates that LLMs exhibit robust
code comprehension and generation capabilities even for non-mainstream
languages. MSG successfully generates verifiable specifications for 84% of
tested Move functions and even identifies clauses previously overlooked by
experts. Additionally, MSG shows that explicitly leveraging specification
language features through an agentic, modular design improves specification
quality substantially (generating 57% more verifiable clauses than conventional
designs). Incorporating feedback from the verification toolchain further
enhances the effectiveness of MSG, leading to a 30% increase in generated
verifiable specifications.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Similarity-based Reproducibility Index (SRI) to evaluate the reproducibility of results in Jupyter Notebooks using similarity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in maintaining consistent computational results from Jupyter Notebooks, caused by randomness, library changes, or environment differences.

Method: The SRI metric uses similarity metrics tailored to Python objects to compare outputs from rerun notebooks with their originals, providing a reproducibility score and qualitative insights.

Result: SRI offers a reproducibility score between 0 and 1 for each cell in rerun Jupyter Notebooks and includes qualitative insights, demonstrated through a case study.

Conclusion: SRI is a practical tool for quantitatively and qualitatively assessing computational reproducibility in Jupyter Notebooks.

Abstract: Computational reproducibility refers to obtaining consistent results when
rerunning an experiment. Jupyter Notebook, a web-based computational notebook
application, facilitates running, publishing, and sharing computational
experiments along with their results. However, rerunning a Jupyter Notebook may
not always generate identical results due to various factors, such as
randomness, changes in library versions, or variations in the computational
environment. This paper introduces the Similarity-based Reproducibility Index
(SRI) -- a metric for assessing the reproducibility of results in Jupyter
Notebooks. SRI employs novel methods developed based on similarity metrics
specific to different types of Python objects to compare rerun outputs against
original outputs. For every cell generating an output in a rerun notebook, SRI
reports a quantitative score in the range [0, 1] as well as some qualitative
insights to assess reproducibility. The paper also includes a case study in
which the proposed metric is applied to a set of Jupyter Notebooks,
demonstrating how various similarity metrics can be leveraged to quantify
computational reproducibility.

*Xinyue Zuo,Yifan Zhang,Hongshu Wang,Yufan Cai,Zhe Hou,Jing Sun,Jin Song Dong*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces PAT-Agent, a framework that combines LLMs and formal verification techniques to automate formal model construction, achieving high verification success and maintaining accessibility for non-experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Formal verification is a rigorous method for ensuring system correctness, but its complexity makes automation challenging, especially when bridging the gap between formal logic and natural language.

Method: PAT-Agent uses a Planning LLM for extracting key elements and generating modeling plans, a Code Generation LLM for synthesizing correct and meaningful formal models, and the PAT model checker for verification. A Repair Loop fixes discrepancies using counterexamples, and a web-based interface facilitates interaction with users.

Result: PAT-Agent demonstrated superior performance compared to baseline methods in verifying systems, with high success rates and efficiency. Ablation studies confirmed the critical role of planning and repair, while user studies validated its accessibility and effectiveness for non-experts.

Conclusion: PAT-Agent effectively automates and simplifies formal model construction and verification by leveraging LLMs, making the process efficient and accessible to a broader audience, including those with limited expertise in formal methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer promising potential for
automating formal methods. However, applying them to formal verification
remains challenging due to the complexity of specification languages, the risk
of hallucinated output, and the semantic gap between natural language and
formal logic. We introduce PAT-Agent, an end-to-end framework for natural
language autoformalization and formal model repair that combines the generative
capabilities of LLMs with the rigor of formal verification to automate the
construction of verifiable formal models. In PAT-Agent, a Planning LLM first
extracts key modeling elements and generates a detailed plan using semantic
prompts, which then guides a Code Generation LLM to synthesize syntactically
correct and semantically faithful formal models. The resulting code is verified
using the Process Analysis Toolkit (PAT) model checker against user-specified
properties, and when discrepancies occur, a Repair Loop is triggered to
iteratively correct the model using counterexamples. To improve flexibility, we
built a web-based interface that enables users, particularly non-FM-experts, to
describe, customize, and verify system behaviors through user-LLM interactions.
Experimental results on 40 systems show that PAT-Agent consistently outperforms
baselines, achieving high verification success with superior efficiency. The
ablation studies confirm the importance of both planning and repair components,
and the user study demonstrates that our interface is accessible and supports
effective formal modeling, even for users with limited formal methods
experience.

### [1148] [Satellite: Detecting and Analyzing Smart Contract Vulnerabilities caused by Subcontract Misuse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23679)
*Zeqin Liao,Yuhong Nan,Zixu Gao,Henglong Liang,Sicheng Hao,Jiajing Wu,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Satellite, a framework for detecting subcontract misuse vulnerabilities (SMV) in smart contracts at the bytecode level, achieving strong performance metrics and uncovering real vulnerabilities affecting digital assets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to address the security risks in smart contracts caused by subcontract reuse. Developers often reuse subcontracts to save time, but this can unintentionally include vulnerabilities, posing risks to the entire contract. Detecting these vulnerabilities is challenging due to the bytecode-only nature of smart contracts and the obscuration of class-level and semantic information in such contracts.

Method: The authors introduce Satellite, a static analysis framework that operates on bytecode. It employs transfer learning to recover inherited methods, extracts method-level features for comparing reused subcontract components, and uses specific vulnerability indicators to detect subcontract misuse vulnerabilities.

Result: Satellite achieved a precision rate of 84.68% and a recall rate of 92.11% in detecting SMVs. It identified 14 new/unknown vulnerabilities in a dataset of 10,011 real-world smart contracts, exposing risks to digital assets worth $201,358.

Conclusion: Satellite effectively leverages advanced analysis techniques to identify subcontract vulnerabilities in smart contracts, proving its utility in enhancing smart contract security. Its ability to discover unknown vulnerabilities further highlights its potential impact on the field.

Abstract: Developers of smart contracts pervasively reuse subcontracts to improve
development efficiency. Like any program language, such subcontract reuse may
unexpectedly include, or introduce vulnerabilities to the end-point smart
contract. Unfortunately, automatically detecting such issues poses several
unique challenges. Particularly, in most cases, smart contracts are compiled as
bytecode, whose class-level information (e.g., inheritance, virtual function
table), and even semantics (e.g., control flow and data flow) are fully
obscured as a single smart contract after compilation.
  In this paper, we propose Satellite, a new bytecode-level static analysis
framework for subcontract misuse vulnerability (SMV) detection in smart
contracts. Satellite incorporates a series of novel designs to enhance its
overall effectiveness.. Particularly, Satellite utilizes a transfer learning
method to recover the inherited methods, which are critical for identifying
subcontract reuse in smart contracts. Further, Satellite extracts a set of
fine-grained method-level features and performs a method-level comparison, for
identifying the reuse part of subcontract in smart contracts. Finally,
Satellite summarizes a set of SMV indicators according to their types, and
hence effectively identifies SMVs. To evaluate Satellite, we construct a
dataset consisting of 58 SMVs derived from real-world attacks and collect
additional 56 SMV patterns from SOTA studies. Experiment results indicate that
Satellite exhibits good performance in identifying SMV, with a precision rate
of 84.68% and a recall rate of 92.11%. In addition, Satellite successfully
identifies 14 new/unknown SMV over 10,011 real-world smart contracts, affecting
a total amount of digital assets worth 201,358 USD.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes an influence-guided concolic testing method for Transformer classifiers, using SHAP-based estimates for ranking path predicates and solver-compatible attention semantics to efficiently find label-flip inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency and feasibility of concolic testing on modern Transformer classifiers, aiming to debug and audit models effectively.

Method: The method combines SHAP-based influence guidance to rank path predicates, prototypes pure-Python semantics for multi-head self-attention mechanisms, and introduces heuristics to manage constraint growth.

Result: Influence-guided testing outperforms FIFO baselines in finding label-flip inputs, maintains efficiency in deeper networks, and uncovers shared compact decision logic across attack instances.

Conclusion: The findings establish that influence guidance aids symbolic exploration, and solver-friendly semantics paired with scheduling make concolic testing practical for modern Transformers, proving useful for model debugging and auditing.

Abstract: Concolic testing for deep neural networks alternates concrete execution with
constraint solving to search for inputs that flip decisions. We present an
{influence-guided} concolic tester for Transformer classifiers that ranks path
predicates by SHAP-based estimates of their impact on the model output. To
enable SMT solving on modern architectures, we prototype a solver-compatible,
pure-Python semantics for multi-head self-attention and introduce practical
scheduling heuristics that temper constraint growth on deeper models. In a
white-box study on compact Transformers under small $L_0$ budgets, influence
guidance finds label-flip inputs more efficiently than a FIFO baseline and
maintains steady progress on deeper networks. Aggregating successful attack
instances with a SHAP-based critical decision path analysis reveals recurring,
compact decision logic shared across attacks. These observations suggest that
(i) influence signals provide a useful search bias for symbolic exploration,
and (ii) solver-friendly attention semantics paired with lightweight scheduling
make concolic testing feasible for contemporary Transformer models, offering
potential utility for debugging and model auditing.

### [1150] [Navigating the Labyrinth: Path-Sensitive Unit Test Generation with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23812)
*Dianshu Liao,Xin Yin,Shidong Pan,Chao Ni,Zhenchang Xing,Xiaoyu Sun*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: JUnitGenie is a system that improves the effectiveness of unit test generation through a path-sensitive approach combining code analysis and large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unit testing is crucial for software quality assurance, but existing automated methods struggle with coverage, particularly for complex execution paths.

Method: The paper introduces JUnitGenie, which extracts code knowledge, uses structured prompts for leveraging large language models, and focuses on context-aware unit test generation.

Result: JUnitGenie improved branch coverage by 29.60%, line coverage by 31.00%, and identified real-world bugs in ten Java projects.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that JUnitGenie effectively increases unit test coverage and helps uncover real-world bugs, proving its advantage over traditional methods.

Abstract: Unit testing is essential for software quality assurance, yet writing and
maintaining tests remains time-consuming and error-prone. To address this
challenge, researchers have proposed various techniques for automating unit
test generation, including traditional heuristic-based methods and more recent
approaches that leverage large language models (LLMs). However, these existing
approaches are inherently path-insensitive because they rely on fixed
heuristics or limited contextual information and fail to reason about deep
control-flow structures. As a result, they often struggle to achieve adequate
coverage, particularly for deep or complex execution paths. In this work, we
present a path-sensitive framework, JUnitGenie, to fill this gap by combining
code knowledge with the semantic capabilities of LLMs in guiding context-aware
unit test generation. After extracting code knowledge from Java projects,
JUnitGenie distills this knowledge into structured prompts to guide the
generation of high-coverage unit tests. We evaluate JUnitGenie on 2,258 complex
focal methods from ten real-world Java projects. The results show that
JUnitGenie generates valid tests and improves branch and line coverage by
29.60% and 31.00% on average over both heuristic and LLM-based baselines. We
further demonstrate that the generated test cases can uncover real-world bugs,
which were later confirmed and fixed by developers.

### [1151] [SolContractEval: A Benchmark for Evaluating Contract-Level Solidity Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23824)
*Zhifan Ye,Jiachi Chen,Zhenzhe Shao,Lingfeng Bao,Xiaohu Yang,Zhongxin Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SolContractEval, a new benchmark for Solidity code generation, evaluates six LLMs, and highlights their performance gaps in handling Solidity-specific features and complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the need for reliable smart contract generation tools and to evaluate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in generating Solidity code, which differs significantly from general-purpose languages.

Method: The researchers developed SolContractEval, a benchmark with 124 tasks derived from real on-chain contracts. They annotated tasks independently and validated them using experts. They also created a dynamic evaluation framework for assessing functional correctness through transaction replay. Six mainstream LLMs were systematically evaluated on this benchmark.

Result: The study found that Claude-3.7-Sonnet performed the best but that all evaluated models underperformed compared to their performance on general-purpose languages. They succeeded in standard-pattern tasks but struggled with complex logic, inter-contract dependencies, and Solidity-specific intricacies.

Conclusion: LLMs have potential for Solidity code generation but require improvements in their understanding of Solidity-specific syntax, features, and context to effectively handle complex and real-world smart contract development tasks.

Abstract: The rise of blockchain has brought smart contracts into mainstream use,
creating a demand for smart contract generation tools. While large language
models (LLMs) excel at generating code in general-purpose languages, their
effectiveness on Solidity, the primary language for smart contracts, remains
underexplored. Solidity constitutes only a small portion of typical LLM
training data and differs from general-purpose languages in its
version-sensitive syntax and limited flexibility. These factors raise concerns
about the reliability of existing LLMs for Solidity code generation.
Critically, existing evaluations, focused on isolated functions and synthetic
inputs, fall short of assessing models' capabilities in real-world contract
development.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce SolContractEval, the first contract-level
benchmark for Solidity code generation. It comprises 124 tasks drawn from real
on-chain contracts across nine major domains. Each task input, consisting of
complete context dependencies, a structured contract framework, and a concise
task prompt, is independently annotated and cross-validated by experienced
developers. To enable precise and automated evaluation of functional
correctness, we also develop a dynamic evaluation framework based on historical
transaction replay. Building on SolContractEval, we perform a systematic
evaluation of six mainstream LLMs. We find that Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieves the
highest overall performance, though evaluated models underperform relative to
their capabilities on class-level generation tasks in general-purpose
programming languages. Second, current models perform better on tasks that
follow standard patterns but struggle with complex logic and inter-contract
dependencies. Finally, they exhibit limited understanding of Solidity-specific
features and contextual dependencies.

### [1152] [HFuzzer: Testing Large Language Models for Package Hallucinations via Phrase-based Fuzzing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23835)
*Yukai Zhao,Menghan Wu,Xing Hu,Xin Xia*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents HFUZZER, a fuzzing framework to test Large Language Models (LLMs) for package hallucinations, highlighting its effectiveness in identifying unique hallucinated packages and diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are prone to package hallucinations, presenting a potential security risk as attackers can exploit these weaknesses for software supply chain attacks, necessitating rigorous testing of LLMs to address this vulnerability.

Method: The paper introduces HFUZZER, a phrase-based fuzzing framework that generates relevant and diverse coding tasks to identify package hallucinations by extracting and utilizing meaningful phrases from package information or coding tasks.

Result: HFUZZER identifies 2.60x more unique hallucinated packages compared to traditional fuzzing frameworks and demonstrates effectiveness across multiple LLMs, including finding 46 unique hallucinated packages in GPT-4o.

Conclusion: HFUZZER is an effective tool for uncovering package hallucinations in LLMs, with the potential to enhance code generation security by revealing weaknesses in both code generation and environment configuration tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for code generation, but they
face critical security risks when applied to practical production due to
package hallucinations, in which LLMs recommend non-existent packages. These
hallucinations can be exploited in software supply chain attacks, where
malicious attackers exploit them to register harmful packages. It is critical
to test LLMs for package hallucinations to mitigate package hallucinations and
defend against potential attacks. Although researchers have proposed testing
frameworks for fact-conflicting hallucinations in natural language generation,
there is a lack of research on package hallucinations. To fill this gap, we
propose HFUZZER, a novel phrase-based fuzzing framework to test LLMs for
package hallucinations. HFUZZER adopts fuzzing technology and guides the model
to infer a wider range of reasonable information based on phrases, thereby
generating enough and diverse coding tasks. Furthermore, HFUZZER extracts
phrases from package information or coding tasks to ensure the relevance of
phrases and code, thereby improving the relevance of generated tasks and code.
We evaluate HFUZZER on multiple LLMs and find that it triggers package
hallucinations across all selected models. Compared to the mutational fuzzing
framework, HFUZZER identifies 2.60x more unique hallucinated packages and
generates more diverse tasks. Additionally, when testing the model GPT-4o,
HFUZZER finds 46 unique hallucinated packages. Further analysis reveals that
for GPT-4o, LLMs exhibit package hallucinations not only during code generation
but also when assisting with environment configuration.

TL;DR: The paper presents a Learning-Based Testing (LBT) approach that enhances fault detection and robustness in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by prioritizing adversarial test cases efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current methods that fail to efficiently identify fault-revealing inputs in DNNs, especially in critical applications requiring resilience against adversarial attacks.

Method: Integrates Learning-Based Testing with hypothesis and mutation testing to prioritize adversarial inputs likely to expose model faults, while remaining architecture-agnostic and adaptable to diverse DNNs.

Result: The proposed method outperforms baseline approaches by prioritizing fault-revealing inputs, accelerating fault detection, and uncovering faults more quickly across varied datasets, architectures, and adversarial techniques.

Conclusion: The method enhances fault detection, preserves input diversity, and guides effective model retraining, making it a practical and robust solution for adversarial test prioritization in real-world applications.

Abstract: Context: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, where resilience against adversarial inputs is paramount.
However, whether coverage-based or confidence-based, existing test
prioritization methods often fail to efficiently identify the most
fault-revealing inputs, limiting their practical effectiveness. Aims: This
project aims to enhance fault detection and model robustness in DNNs by
integrating Learning-Based Testing (LBT) with hypothesis and mutation testing
to efficiently prioritize adversarial test cases. Methods: Our method selects a
subset of adversarial inputs with a high likelihood of exposing model faults,
without relying on architecture-specific characteristics or formal
verification, making it adaptable across diverse DNNs. Results: Our results
demonstrate that the proposed LBT method consistently surpasses baseline
approaches in prioritizing fault-revealing inputs and accelerating fault
detection. By efficiently organizing test permutations, it uncovers all
potential faults significantly faster across various datasets, model
architectures, and adversarial attack techniques. Conclusion: Beyond improving
fault detection, our method preserves input diversity and provides effective
guidance for model retraining, further enhancing robustness. These advantages
establish our approach as a powerful and practical solution for adversarial
test prioritization in real-world DNN applications.

*Jialun Zhang,Merve Gülmez,Thomas Nyman,Gang Tan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SandCell offers lightweight isolation for safe and unsafe Rust code through flexible sandboxing, minimizing performance overhead while enhancing memory safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for isolating unsafe Rust code lack flexibility and fail to accommodate customizable sandboxing policies that target both safe and unsafe code.

Method: The authors developed SandCell, a system that enables programmers to specify sandboxed components via existing Rust syntax with minimal annotations, while introducing optimizations for efficient data transfer between sandboxes.

Result: Evaluation showed SandCell effectively prevents vulnerabilities in Rust applications, with a manageable impact on performance.

Conclusion: SandCell enhances Rust's memory safety by offering fine-grained and flexible isolation of code, balancing ease of use with performance efficiency.

Abstract: Rust is a modern systems programming language that ensures memory safety by
enforcing ownership and borrowing rules at compile time. While the unsafe
keyword allows programmers to bypass these restrictions, it introduces
significant risks. Various approaches for isolating unsafe code to protect safe
Rust from vulnerabilities have been proposed, yet these methods provide only
fixed isolation boundaries and do not accommodate expressive policies that
require sandboxing both safe and unsafe code. This paper presents SandCell for
flexible and lightweight isolation in Rust by leveraging existing syntactic
boundaries. SandCell allows programmers to specify which components to sandbox
with minimal annotation effort, enabling fine-grained control over isolation.
The system also introduces novel techniques to minimize overhead when
transferring data between sandboxes. Our evaluation demonstrates SandCell's
effectiveness in preventing vulnerabilities across various Rust applications
while maintaining reasonable performance overheads.

### [1155] [TENET: Leveraging Tests Beyond Validation for Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24148)
*Yiran Hu,Nan Jiang,Shanchao Liang,Yi Wu,Lin Tan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: TENET is a proposed LLM agent designed to tackle challenges in test-driven development (TDD), achieving better testing and code refinement through intelligent test suite selection, context retrieval, and iterative workflow refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve test-driven development in the era of 'vibe coding,' where developers rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate software code efficiently.

Method: TENET integrates three mechanisms: concise test suite selection for diverse usage scenarios, efficient code context retrieval, and reflection-based workflows for code refinement using test feedback.

Result: TENET achieves high performance metrics—69.08% Pass@1 on RepoCod and 81.77% Pass@1 on RepoEval benchmarks—surpassing existing baselines by 9.49 and 2.17 percentage points, respectively.

Conclusion: TENET demonstrates that intelligently structured TDD, combined with advanced LLM capabilities, can significantly enhance both accuracy and efficiency in code generation workflows for complex repositories.

Abstract: Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a widely adopted software engineering
practice that requires developers to create and execute tests alongside code
implementation, ensuring that software behavior is continuously validated and
refined. In the era of vibe coding, where developers increasingly delegate code
writing to large language models (LLMs) by specifying high-level intentions,
TDD becomes even more crucial, as test cases serve as executable specifications
that explicitly define and verify intended functionality beyond what
natural-language descriptions and code context can convey. While vibe coding
under TDD is promising, there are three main challenges: (1) selecting a small
yet effective test suite to improve the generation accuracy and control the
execution workload, (2) retrieving context such as relevant code effectively,
and (3) systematically using test feedback for effective code refinement. To
address these challenges, we introduce TENET, an LLM agent for generating
functions in complex real-world repositories under the TDD setting. TENET
features three components: (1) a novel test harness mechanism that selects a
concise test suite to maximize diversity of target usage scenarios; (2) a
tailored agent toolset that performs efficient retrieval of relevant code with
interactive debugging; and (3) a reflection-based refinement workflow that
iteratively analyzes failures, replenishes context, and applies code
refinement. TENET achieves 69.08% and 81.77% Pass@1 on RepoCod and RepoEval
benchmarks, outperforming the best agentic baselines by 9.49 and 2.17
percentage points, respectively. In addition, this is the first study of
test-driven code generation with repository-level context, examining how
different aspects of test suites affect the performance of LLM agents under the
TDD setting.

### [1156] [Metamorphic Testing for Audio Content Moderation Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24215)
*Wenxuan Wang,Yongjiang Wu,Junyuan Zhang,Shuqing Li,Yun Peng,Wenting Chen,Shuai Wang,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces "MTAM," a Metamorphic Testing framework aimed at evaluating and improving audio content moderation systems' robustness against adversarial inputs, achieving significant error detection rates in commercial and academic tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The use of audio-centric platforms has grown, but they are misused for spreading harmful content. Existing audio moderation tools are vulnerable to adversarial alterations, yet their robustness against such inputs remains underexplored.

Method: The authors developed "MTAM," a framework that uses metamorphic testing by applying 14 defined metamorphic relations across two perturbation categories to toxic audio content, creating adversarial test cases for evaluation purposes.

Result: MTAM demonstrated error-finding rates of up to 51.1% in commercial tools by Gladia, Assembly AI, Baidu, Nextdata, and Tencent, and 45.7% in state-of-the-art academic algorithms, highlighting their vulnerabilities to adversarial inputs.

Conclusion: MTAM is effective in uncovering vulnerabilities in current audio content moderation tools, emphasizing the need for improved adversarial robustness in protecting against harmful audio content.

Abstract: The rapid growth of audio-centric platforms and applications such as WhatsApp
and Twitter has transformed the way people communicate and share audio content
in modern society. However, these platforms are increasingly misused to
disseminate harmful audio content, such as hate speech, deceptive
advertisements, and explicit material, which can have significant negative
consequences (e.g., detrimental effects on mental health). In response,
researchers and practitioners have been actively developing and deploying audio
content moderation tools to tackle this issue. Despite these efforts, malicious
actors can bypass moderation systems by making subtle alterations to audio
content, such as modifying pitch or inserting noise. Moreover, the
effectiveness of modern audio moderation tools against such adversarial inputs
remains insufficiently studied. To address these challenges, we propose MTAM, a
Metamorphic Testing framework for Audio content Moderation software.
Specifically, we conduct a pilot study on 2000 audio clips and define 14
metamorphic relations across two perturbation categories: Audio Features-Based
and Heuristic perturbations. MTAM applies these metamorphic relations to toxic
audio content to generate test cases that remain harmful while being more
likely to evade detection. In our evaluation, we employ MTAM to test five
commercial textual content moderation software and an academic model against
three kinds of toxic content. The results show that MTAM achieves up to 38.6%,
18.3%, 35.1%, 16.7%, and 51.1% error finding rates (EFR) when testing
commercial moderation software provided by Gladia, Assembly AI, Baidu,
Nextdata, and Tencent, respectively, and it obtains up to 45.7% EFR when
testing the state-of-the-art algorithms from the academy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limited research on domain-specific applications of LLMs in Finance.

Method: Design Science Research was used to iteratively design and evaluate two systems based on LLMs.

Result: Cloud models showed fluency but had privacy concerns, while open-source models required more engineering effort.

Conclusion: Careful architectural and engineering strategies needed for successful LLM integration in financial reporting.

Abstract: Context: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable automation of complex natural
language processing across domains, but research on domain-specific
applications like Finance remains limited. Objectives: This study explored
open-source and commercial LLMs for financial report analysis and commentary
generation, focusing on software engineering challenges in implementation.
Methods: Using Design Science Research methodology, an exploratory case study
iteratively designed and evaluated two LLM-based systems: one with local
open-source models in a multi-agent workflow, another using commercial GPT-4o.
Both were assessed through expert evaluation of real-world financial reporting
use cases. Results: LLMs demonstrated strong potential for automating financial
reporting tasks, but integration presented significant challenges. Iterative
development revealed issues including prompt design, contextual dependency, and
implementation trade-offs. Cloud-based models offered superior fluency and
usability but raised data privacy and external dependency concerns. Local
open-source models provided better data control and compliance but required
substantially more engineering effort for reliability and usability.
Conclusion: LLMs show strong potential for financial reporting automation, but
successful integration requires careful attention to architecture, prompt
design, and system reliability. Implementation success depends on addressing
domain-specific challenges through tailored validation mechanisms and
engineering strategies that balance accuracy, control, and compliance.

*Junjie Meng,Jie An,Yong Li,Andrea Turrini,Fanjiang Xu,Naijun Zhan,Miaomiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper improves the identification of deterministic finite automata (DFAs) decomposition problems by introducing a compact representation, reducing inefficiencies in traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in traditional DFA learning methods that suffer from lack of modularity and scalability when handling complex systems.

Method: The authors developed a framework utilizing 3-valued DFA (3DFA) instead of Augmented Prefix Tree Acceptors (APTAs) for SAT encodings, minimizing redundancies.

Result: The proposed approach enhances efficiency in traditional Pareto-optimal decomposition and scales better for states-optimal decomposition problems.

Conclusion: Using 3DFA significantly streamlines DFA decomposition, improving scalability and efficiency in solving DFA-DIPs.

Abstract: The identification of deterministic finite automata (DFAs) from labeled
examples is a cornerstone of automata learning, yet traditional methods focus
on learning monolithic DFAs, which often yield a large DFA lacking simplicity
and interoperability. Recent work addresses these limitations by exploring DFA
decomposition identification problems (DFA-DIPs), which model system behavior
as intersections of multiple DFAs, offering modularity for complex tasks.
However, existing DFA-DIP approaches depend on SAT encodings derived from
Augmented Prefix Tree Acceptors (APTAs), incurring scalability limitations due
to their inherent redundancy.
  In this work, we advance DFA-DIP research through studying two variants: the
traditional Pareto-optimal DIP and the novel states-optimal DIP, which
prioritizes a minimal number of states. We propose a novel framework that
bridges DFA decomposition with recent advancements in automata representation.
One of our key innovations replaces APTA with 3-valued DFA (3DFA) derived
directly from labeled examples. This compact representation eliminates
redundancies of APTA, thus drastically reducing variables in the improved SAT
encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that our 3DFA-based approach
achieves significant efficiency gains for the Pareto-optimal DIP while enabling
a scalable solution for the states-optimal DIP.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes FaithLog, a trustworthy log-based anomaly detection system achieving faithfulness through causality-guided attention and adversarial consistency learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for log-based anomaly detection act as 'black boxes,' undermining trust and deployment due to lack of interpretability.

Method: FaithLog introduces causality-guided attention mechanisms and adversarial consistency learning for improved diagnosable anomaly detection.

Result: FaithLog outperforms existing models in diagnostic faithfulness on both public and industrial datasets.

Conclusion: FaithLog provides a trustworthy anomaly detection system, enhancing interpretability and fostering trust from service providers.

Abstract: Log-based software reliability maintenance systems are crucial for sustaining
stable customer experience. However, existing deep learning-based methods
represent a black box for service providers, making it impossible for providers
to understand how these methods detect anomalies, thereby hindering trust and
deployment in real production environments. To address this issue, this paper
defines a trustworthiness metric, diagnostic faithfulness, for models to gain
service providers' trust, based on surveys of SREs at a major cloud provider.
We design two evaluation tasks: attention-based root cause localization and
event perturbation. Empirical studies demonstrate that existing methods perform
poorly in diagnostic faithfulness. Consequently, we propose FaithLog, a
faithful log-based anomaly detection system, which achieves faithfulness
through a carefully designed causality-guided attention mechanism and
adversarial consistency learning. Evaluation results on two public datasets and
one industrial dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in diagnostic faithfulness.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes Chimera, an end-to-end log-based fault diagnosis method, to interactively combine anomaly detection and root cause localization, addressing diagnostic biases, reliance on costly monitoring data, and the lack of collaboration between tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are critical issues in existing fault diagnosis methods, including diagnostic biases, dependency on expensive data, and lack of inter-task collaboration.

Method: The authors introduced Chimera, an interactive multi-task learning framework, that integrates anomaly detection and root cause localization at data, feature, and result levels for end-to-end fault diagnosis.

Result: Chimera demonstrated superior performance on public and industrial datasets, with significant improvements in anomaly detection (2.92%-5.00%) and root cause localization (19.01%-37.09%).

Conclusion: Chimera bridges the gap between diagnostic tasks, achieving high accuracy and practicality, and has been deployed in an industrial cloud platform successfully.

Abstract: Log-based fault diagnosis is essential for maintaining software system
availability. However, existing fault diagnosis methods are built using a
task-independent manner, which fails to bridge the gap between anomaly
detection and root cause localization in terms of data form and diagnostic
objectives, resulting in three major issues: 1) Diagnostic bias accumulates in
the system; 2) System deployment relies on expensive monitoring data; 3) The
collaborative relationship between diagnostic tasks is overlooked. Facing this
problems, we propose a novel end-to-end log-based fault diagnosis method,
Chimera, whose key idea is to achieve end-to-end fault diagnosis through
bidirectional interaction and knowledge transfer between anomaly detection and
root cause localization. Chimera is based on interactive multi-task learning,
carefully designing interaction strategies between anomaly detection and root
cause localization at the data, feature, and diagnostic result levels, thereby
achieving both sub-tasks interactively within a unified end-to-end framework.
Evaluation on two public datasets and one industrial dataset shows that Chimera
outperforms existing methods in both anomaly detection and root cause
localization, achieving improvements of over 2.92% - 5.00% and 19.01% - 37.09%,
respectively. It has been successfully deployed in production, serving an
industrial cloud platform.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agentic Service Computing (ASC), a framework for developing autonomous, goal-driven services powered by LLMs, structured around a four-phase lifecycle: Design, Deployment, Operation, and Evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the shift in services computing from static request-response models to dynamic, autonomous multi-agent systems driven by LLMs.

Method: The authors propose a lifecycle-driven framework for ASC, analyzing its processes through four research dimensions: environment modeling, autonomous decision-making, collaboration, and trustworthiness.

Result: The study reveals key principles for ASC, showing that effective services are orchestrated through contextual awareness, autonomous reasoning, collaboration, and maintaining trustworthiness.

Conclusion: The paper lays a holistic foundation for ASC, integrating classical services computing with modern multi-agent systems, aiming for adaptive and human-centered intelligent services.

Abstract: The rise of LLM-powered agents is driving a fundamental transformation in
services computing: from static, request-response functions to dynamic,
goal-oriented, and autonomous multi-agent ecosystems. In response to this
shift, we introduce Agentic Service Computing (ASC), a new paradigm that
reimagines services as intelligent, self-adaptive, and socially embedded
entities. This comprehensive survey presents a lifecycle-driven framework for
ASC, structured around four core phases: Design, Deployment, Operation, and
Evolution. We systematically analyze ASC through four foundational research
dimensions: (1) Perception, Context, and Environment Modeling, (2) Autonomous
Decision-Making and Task Execution, (3) Multi-Agent Collaboration and
Organization, and (4) Evaluation, Value Alignment, and Trustworthiness. We
examine how these dimensions are instantiated, integrated, and continuously
adapted across the service lifecycle. Our synthesis reveals that agentic
services are not merely assembled but orchestrated: contextual awareness
enables robust deployment; autonomous reasoning supports real-time operation;
collaborative structures emerge and evolve through interaction; and
trustworthiness must be upheld as a cross-cutting, lifelong imperative. We
further identify and discuss emerging trends shaping the future of ASC. By
integrating classical principles of services computing with advances in
LLM-based multi-agent systems, this work establishes a holistic and
forward-looking foundation for ASC. It provides a unified reference for
researchers and practitioners aiming to develop adaptive, accountable, and
human-centered intelligent services.

*Yuanhe Zhang,Zhiquan Yang,Shengyi Pan,Zhongxin Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents TESTUPDATER, an LLM-based tool that automatically updates unit tests after code changes, addressing inefficiencies in manual updates and improving accuracy over existing automated methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual maintenance of unit tests is inefficient and prone to errors, requiring an automated solution for updating tests to handle both repair and enhancement.

Method: TESTUPDATER uses an LLM to analyze code changes, extract relevant context, guide repair and enhancement through structured prompts, and iteratively refine tests based on error types, ensuring higher correctness. A new benchmark, UPDATES4J, was also developed for evaluation.

Result: TESTUPDATER significantly outperformed SYNTER with a 94.4% compilation pass rate, 86.7% test pass rate, and achieved better branch (12.9% higher) and line coverage (15.2% greater).

Conclusion: TESTUPDATER advances the field of automated test maintenance by handling complex code changes more effectively, offering a reliable and comprehensive solution for just-in-time test updates.

Abstract: Unit testing is critical for ensuring software quality and software system
stability. The current practice of manually maintaining unit tests suffers from
low efficiency and the risk of delayed or overlooked fixes. Therefore, an
automated approach is required to instantly update unit tests, with the
capability to both repair and enhance unit tests. However, existing automated
test maintenance methods primarily focus on repairing broken tests, neglecting
the scenario of enhancing existing tests to verify new functionality.
Meanwhile, due to their reliance on rule-based context collection and the lack
of verification mechanisms, existing approaches struggle to handle complex code
changes and often produce test cases with low correctness. To address these
challenges, we propose TESTUPDATER, a novel LLM based approach that enables
automated just-in-time test updates in response to production code changes.
TESTUPDATER first leverages the LLM to analyze code changes and identify
relevant context, which it then extracts and filters. Then, through carefully
designed prompts, TESTUPDATER guides the LLM step by step to handle various
types of code changes and introduce new dependencies, enabling both test repair
and enhancement. Finally, we introduce an error-type-aware iterative refinement
mechanism that executes the LLM-updated tests and repairs failures, which
significantly improves the overall correctness of test updates. Since existing
test repair datasets lack scenarios of test enhancement, we further construct a
new benchmark, UPDATES4J, with 195 real-world samples from 7 projects.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces JSProtect, a high-throughput JavaScript obfuscation framework to address IP theft in WeChat mini-game ecosystems by improving scalability, performance, and security while minimizing code size inflation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The WeChat mini-game ecosystem is plagued by intellectual property theft due to secondary development, while existing JavaScript obfuscation tools are inadequate for large-scale applications, suffering from severe inefficiencies and performance issues.

Method: The proposed framework, JSProtect, employs the Parallel-Aware Scope Analysis (PASA) algorithm to enable multi-core processing and efficient namespace management. This allows independent code partitioning and aggressive short identifier reuse.

Result: JSProtect processes 20MB codebases in minutes, ensures semantic equivalence, limits code size inflation to 20% (as opposed to over 1,000% with baseline tools), preserves near-native runtime performance, and offers robust security against static analysis tools and language models.

Conclusion: The work establishes JSProtect as a new standard in industrial-scale JavaScript protection, striking a balance between security, performance, and scalability.

Abstract: The WeChat mini-game ecosystem faces rampant intellectual property theft to
other platforms via secondary development, yet existing JavaScript obfuscation
tools are ill-equipped for large-scale applications, suffering from prohibitive
processing times, severe runtime performance degradation, and unsustainable
code size inflation. This paper introduces JSProtect, a high-throughput
parallelized obfuscation framework designed to overcome these fundamental
limitations. At the core of our framework is the Parallel-Aware Scope Analysis
(PASA) algorithm, which enables two key optimizations: independent code
partitioning for multi-core processing and independent namespace management
that aggressively reuses short identifiers to combat code bloat. Our evaluation
demonstrates that JSProtectprocesses 20MB codebases in minutes, maintaining
100\% semantic equivalence while controlling code size inflation to as low as
20\% compared to over 1,000\% with baseline tools. Furthermore, it preserves
near-native runtime performance and provides superior security effectiveness
against both static analysis tools and large language models. This work
presents a new paradigm for industrial-scale JavaScript protection that
effectively balances robust security with high performance and scalability.

### [1165] [SemGuard: Real-Time Semantic Evaluator for Correcting LLM-Generated Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24507)
*Qinglin Wang,Zhihong Sun,Ruyun Wang,Tao Huang,Zhi Jin,Ge Li,Chen Lyu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SemGuard, a framework for real-time, line-level semantic supervision during code generation by large language models (LLMs), reducing semantic errors without executing the program.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic errors in code generated by LLMs are predominant and difficult to address post-hoc; existing solutions, like constrained decoding, lack precision in early error detection. The motivation is to provide early semantic supervision during the code generation process.

Method: SemGuard employs a semantic-evaluator embedded in the LLM's decoder, guided by a new dataset called SemDiff. The approach flags deviations in partial code, rolls back to faulty lines, and guides regeneration in real-time without program execution or test cases.

Result: SemGuard improves semantic error detection and code generation quality, outperforming baseline approaches like ROCODE. Its semantic error rate is reduced by 19.86%, and Pass@1 scores on LiveCodeBench increase by 48.92%, with consistent gains across benchmarks and language models.

Conclusion: SemGuard demonstrates a significant advancement in addressing semantic errors during code generation in LLMs, offering an effective, model-agnostic solution that improves code quality without relying on test cases or runtime execution.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate natural language requirements into
code, yet empirical analyses of representative models reveal that semantic
errors-programs that compile but behave incorrectly-constitute the majority of
observed faults (e.g., >60% on DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B and QwenCoder-7B). Post-hoc
repair pipelines detect such faults only after execution, incurring latency,
relying on incomplete test suites, and often mis-localizing the defect. Since
semantic drift originates in the autoregressive decoding process, intervening
while the code is being generated is a direct way to stop error propagation.
Constrained-decoding approaches such as ROCODE attempt this, but still wait
until the entire program runs to obtain feedback and use entropy heuristics
that do not truly capture semantics. A more effective solution must inject
semantic signals-early and precisely-into the decoding process.We present
SemGuard, a semantic-evaluator-driven framework that performs real-time,
line-level semantic supervision. To train the evaluator, we build SemDiff, the
first dataset with fine-grained annotations that mark the exact line where a
correct and an incorrect implementation diverge. The evaluator, once embedded
in the LLM's decoder, flags deviations on partial code, rolls back to the
faulty line, and guides regeneration-without executing the program or requiring
test cases. Across four benchmarks, SemGuard consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. It lowers the semantic error rate by 19.86% on
SemDiff relative to ROCODE, and lifts Pass@1 by 48.92% on the real-world
LiveCodeBench with CodeLlama-7B. Similar gains hold for StarCoder2-7B on MBPP
and for DeepSeekCoder-6.7B on the Java benchmark SemDiff-Java, demonstrating
model- and language-agnostic effectiveness.

### [1166] [Bridging Developer Instructions and Code Completion Through Instruction-Aware Fill-in-the-Middle Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24637)
*Zhensu Sun,Chengran Yang,Chao Peng,Pengfei Gao,Xiaoning Du,Li Li,David Lo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to follow developer intent in code completion when intent is unclear. This paper introduces IFIM, a training method improving their ability to handle natural language instructions for Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) tasks, leading to improved performance without sacrificing core capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs for code completion fail to effectively utilize natural language instructions due to a lack of instruction-like training or the trade-off posed by existing instruction-tuning methods, which degrade FIM performance.

Method: The authors propose IFIM, which extends the FIM training objective to include developer-provided natural language instructions in a (prefix, instruction, suffix) format. They also construct a new dataset with instruction-labeling for code tasks using GPT-4o.

Result: Applied to Deepseek-Coder and Qwen2.5-Coder models, IFIM boosts instruction-following capabilities and improves Pass@1 scores from 84.6% to 93.6% on HumanEval-infilling while maintaining performance on non-instructional FIM tasks.

Conclusion: The IFIM method effectively enhances the ability of LLMs in instruction-guided FIM code completion without compromising their traditional task performance, presenting a balanced and scalable solution.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced code completion, yet
they often fail when the developer's intent is underspecified in the code
context. To address this, developers usually add natural language instructions
(e.g., comments) into the code context to clarify their intent. However,
existing code LLMs applied for code completion systems merely undergo a
fill-in-the-middle (FIM) pre-training, which struggles to leverage this
information effectively due to the lack of instruction-like training data.
Existing instruction-tuning techniques, which improve instruction-following in
general code generation, paradoxically degrade FIM performance, forcing a
trade-off between instruction-following and infilling capabilities. To address
this gap, we introduce Instruction-aware Fill-in-the-Middle (IFIM), an
instruction-tuning method specifically designed to enhance FIM code completion
models. IFIM extends the conventional FIM training objective by incorporating
an explicit instruction section into the input, enabling the model to learn
from (prefix, instruction, suffix) triplets. This approach allows the model to
effectively leverage developer-provided directives while preserving its core
completion abilities when no instructions are present. To facilitate this, we
constructed a large-scale dataset by using GPT-4o to generate concise,
intent-focused instructions for code infilling examples. We evaluated IFIM by
applying it to two popular base models, Deepseek-Coder and Qwen2.5-Coder, on
the benchmarks derived from HumanEval-infilling and RepoMasterEval. The results
demonstrate that IFIM significantly improves instruction-following
capabilities, boosting the Pass@1 score from 84.6% to 93.6% on
HumanEval-infilling. Moreover, this enhancement does not compromise the models'
original performance on FIM code completion tasks with no instructions
provided.

### [1167] [CoTune: Co-evolutionary Configuration Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24694)
*Gangda Xiong,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoTune, a tuning tool considering target performance requirements and utilizing co-evolution for better system performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency of existing tuners, which fail to properly incorporate complex performance requirements, leads to wasted resources and reduced tuning effectiveness.

Method: Introduces CoTune, which uses co-evolution to create auxiliary performance requirements, assisting and enhancing tuning against target requirements.

Result: CoTune was tested on 162 cases and outperformed existing tuners in 90% of cases, achieving up to 2.9x improvements with better efficiency.

Conclusion: CoTune robustly integrates performance requirements, addressing prior tuner limitations, and achieves superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: To automatically tune configurations for the best possible system performance
(e.g., runtime or throughput), much work has been focused on designing
intelligent heuristics in a tuner. However, existing tuner designs have mostly
ignored the presence of complex performance requirements (e.g., the latency
shall ideally be 2 seconds), but simply assume that better performance is
always more preferred. This would not only waste valuable information in a
requirement but might also consume extensive resources to tune for a goal with
little gain. Yet, prior studies have shown that simply incorporating the
requirement as a tuning objective is problematic since the requirement might be
too strict, harming convergence; or its highly diverse satisfactions might lead
to premature convergence. In this paper, we propose CoTune, a tool that takes
the information of a given target performance requirement into account through
co-evolution. CoTune is unique in the sense that it creates an auxiliary
performance requirement to be co-evolved with the configurations, which assists
the target performance requirement when it becomes ineffective or even
misleading, hence allowing the tuning to be guided by the requirement while
being robust to its harm. Experiment results on 162 cases (nine systems and 18
requirements) reveal that CoTune considerably outperforms existing tuners,
ranking as the best for 90% cases (against the 0%--35% for other tuners) with
up to 2.9x overall improvements, while doing so under a much better efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper reviews research on using large language models (LLMs) for behavioral modeling, highlighting promising results and gaps like a lack of expert evaluations and reliance on GPT models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to fill the gap in literature by providing an overview of LLMs' applications in behavioral modeling and guiding future research efforts.

Method: The study conducted a term-based search to identify 14 relevant primary studies and analyzed these for insights into the effectiveness of LLMs in generating use case and sequence diagrams.

Result: LLMs show promise in generating use case and sequence diagrams, but there is a notable lack of expert evaluations in the current literature, which primarily focuses on GPT-based models.

Conclusion: Future research should expand evaluations to other LLMs and involve domain experts for better validation of LLM-generated outputs in behavioral modeling.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have been extensively utilized
for behavioral modeling, for example, to automatically generate sequence
diagrams. However, no overview of this work has been published yet. Such an
overview will help identify future research directions and inform practitioners
and educators about the effectiveness of LLMs in assisting behavioral modeling.
This study aims to provide an overview of the existing research on the use of
LLMs for behavioral modeling, particularly focusing on use case and sequence
diagrams. Through a term-based search, we filtered and identified 14 relevant
primary studies. Our analysis of the selected primary studies reveals that LLMs
have demonstrated promising results in automatically generating use case and
sequence diagrams. In addition, we found that most of the current literature
lacks expert-based evaluations and has mainly used GPT-based models. Therefore,
future work should evaluate a broader range of LLMs for behavioral modeling and
involve domain experts to evaluate the output of LLMs.

### [1170] [DiffTester: Accelerating Unit Test Generation for Diffusion LLMs via Repetitive Pattern](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24975)
*Lekang Yang,Yuetong Liu,Yitong Zhang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DiffTester improves unit test generation efficiency using diffusion LLMs by leveraging repetitive patterns and enabling accelerated multi-token generation without sacrificing quality. The framework generalizes across models and programming languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unit Testing Generation (UTG) is inefficient with existing LLMs as they generate test cases token-by-token. While diffusion LLMs offer advantages in parallel generation, they struggle with a balance between efficiency and test quality, creating the need for an optimized framework.

Method: DiffTester uses abstract syntax tree analysis to dynamically detect repetitive structural patterns in unit tests targeting the same method. By leveraging these patterns, it adaptively increases token generation per step without quality degradation.

Result: Experiments on broadened benchmarks in Python, Java, and C++ using two representative dLLMs show that DiffTester significantly accelerates test generation while maintaining test coverage.

Conclusion: DiffTester is an effective, generalizable framework that balances efficiency and test quality in UTG, supporting various diffusion LLMs and programming languages.

Abstract: Software development relies heavily on extensive unit testing, which makes
the efficiency of automated Unit Test Generation (UTG) particularly important.
However, most existing LLMs generate test cases one token at a time in each
forward pass, which leads to inefficient UTG. Recently, diffusion LLMs (dLLMs)
have emerged, offering promising parallel generation capabilities and showing
strong potential for efficient UTG. Despite this advantage, their application
to UTG is still constrained by a clear trade-off between efficiency and test
quality, since increasing the number of tokens generated in each step often
causes a sharp decline in the quality of test cases. To overcome this
limitation, we present DiffTester, an acceleration framework specifically
tailored for dLLMs in UTG. The key idea of DiffTester is that unit tests
targeting the same focal method often share repetitive structural patterns. By
dynamically identifying these common patterns through abstract syntax tree
analysis during generation, DiffTester adaptively increases the number of
tokens produced at each step without compromising the quality of the output. To
enable comprehensive evaluation, we extend the original TestEval benchmark,
which was limited to Python, by introducing additional programming languages
including Java and C++. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks with two
representative models show that DiffTester delivers significant acceleration
while preserving test coverage. Moreover, DiffTester generalizes well across
different dLLMs and programming languages, providing a practical and scalable
solution for efficient UTG in software development. Code and data are publicly
available at https://github.com/wellbeingyang/DLM4UTG-open .

*Sogol Masoumzadeh,Keheliya Gallaba,Dayi Lin,Ahmed E. Hassan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper develops a framework using static analysis feedback to detect and repair defects in Foundation Model-generated DSL workflows, highlighting the significant prevalence of defects and addressing the challenge with a static analyzer (Timon) and FM-based repair tool (Pumbaa).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation Models often generate workflows in domain-specific languages (DSLs) that are prone to defects, and manually ensuring correctness is labor-intensive and requires domain expertise. There is a need for automated reliability improvement in FM-generated workflows for better usability.

Method: The authors categorize workflow defects into 18 types, develop Timon, a static analyzer for detecting nine defect types, and integrate it with Pumbaa, an FM-based tool, to repair the detected defects automatically through analysis feedback.

Result: The study finds that 87.27% of FM-generated DSL workflows have at least one defect. Using Timon, nine defect types are detectible, and feedback-directed repair with Pumbaa is demonstrated to be effective.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves the reliability and automation of FM-generated DSL workflows, laying a foundation for their practical adoption and reducing the need for manual intervention.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Foundation Models (FMs) have demonstrated significant
progress in comprehending complex natural language to perform intricate tasks.
Successfully executing these tasks often requires orchestrating calls to FMs
alongside other software components. However, manually decomposing a task into
a coherent sequence of smaller, logically aggregated steps, commonly referred
to as workflows, demands considerable effort and specialized domain knowledge.
While FMs can assist in generating such workflows specified in domain-specific
languages (DSLs), achieving accuracy and reliability in this process remains a
challenge.
  This work introduces a framework that leverages static analysis feedback to
enable FMs to detect and repair defects in the DSL-based workflows they
generate. We begin by presenting the first-ever taxonomy of incidences of
defects in FM-generated DSL workflows, categorizing them into 18 distinct
types. Furthermore, we observe a high prevalence of defects across FM-generated
DSL workflows, with 87.27% of the studied instances containing at least one
defect. This, in turn, emphasizes the magnitude of the problem in practice and
underscores the necessity for implementing mitigation strategies. Following
this, we demonstrate that nine types of these defects can be effectively
identified through static analysis of the workflows. For this purpose, we
develop Timon, the first-of-its-kind static analyzer specifically designed for
FM-generated DSL workflows. Finally, we show that by incorporating feedback
from Timon, we can guide Pumbaa, an FM-based tool, to repair the detected
defect incidences. By systematically detecting and repairing defects, our work
provides a crucial step towards the reliable and automated generation of
executable workflows from natural language requirements.

*Holly Kular,Robert Kim,John Serences,Nuttida Rungratsameetaweemana*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper examines how hierarchical continuous-time recurrent neural networks (ctRNNs) process nonuniform stimulus probabilities and maintain efficient coding without introducing biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how the brain—and potentially artificial neural networks—leverages biased environmental stimuli for efficient coding while maintaining robust generalization, a crucial aspect for developing adaptive architectures.

Method: The researchers trained 3-layer ctRNNs under biased (one stimulus more probable) and unbiased conditions, and studied the information encoded across hidden layers, with additional investigations into feedback pathways.

Result: The model encoded more information about high-probability stimuli under biased conditions, supporting efficient coding. Feedback pathways were found to regulate the representation of low-probability stimuli to avoid bias amplification.

Conclusion: Feedback mechanisms in neural networks play a critical role in balancing efficient coding of biased stimuli while safeguarding against overrepresentation of high-probability inputs, offering insights for robust artificial architectures.

Abstract: Studies of human decision-making demonstrate that environmental regularities,
such as natural image statistics or intentionally nonuniform stimulus
probabilities, can be exploited to improve efficiency (termed
`efficient-coding'). Conversely, from a machine learning perspective, such
nonuniform stimulus properties can lead to biased neural networks with poor
generalization performance. Understanding how the brain flexibly leverages
stimulus bias while maintaining robust generalization could lead to novel
architectures that adaptively exploit environmental structure without
sacrificing performance on out-of-distribution data. To address this
disconnect, we investigated the impact of stimulus regularities in a 3-layer
hierarchical continuous-time recurrent neural network (ctRNN) to better
understand how artificial networks might exploit statistical regularities to
improve efficiency while avoiding undesirable biases. We trained the model to
reproduce one of six possible inputs under biased conditions (stimulus 1 more
probable than stimuli 2-6) or unbiased conditions (all stimuli equally likely).
Across all hidden layers, more information was encoded about high-probability
stimuli, consistent with the efficient-coding framework. Importantly, reducing
feedback from the final hidden layer of trained models selectively magnified
representations of high-probability stimuli, at the expense of low-probability
stimuli, across all layers. Together, these results suggest that models exploit
nonuniform input statistics to improve efficiency, and that feedback pathways
evolve to protect the processing of low-probability stimuli by regulating the
impact of biased input statistics.

*Nikolas McNeal,N. Apurva Ratan Murty*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper reveals vulnerabilities in ANN-based brain models through adversarial probes and emphasizes representational geometry as a robust evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread adoption of artificial neural networks for modeling the human visual system demands enhanced evaluation criteria beyond prediction accuracy.

Method: Small-scale adversarial perturbations are used to evaluate the local representational geometry of ANN-based models.

Result: Key findings include fragility of existing models, improved discrimination through adversarial sensitivity, lack of coding direction transferability, and robustness in select neural coding dimensions.

Conclusion: Local representational geometry offers a superior criterion for evaluating brain models, favoring robust models aligned with neural selectivity and experimental predictions.

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have become the de facto standard for
modeling the human visual system, primarily due to their success in predicting
neural responses. However, with many models now achieving similar predictive
accuracy, we need a stronger criterion. Here, we use small-scale adversarial
probes to characterize the local representational geometry of many highly
predictive ANN-based brain models. We report four key findings. First, we show
that most contemporary ANN-based brain models are unexpectedly fragile. Despite
high prediction scores, their response predictions are highly sensitive to
small, imperceptible perturbations, revealing unreliable local coding
directions. Second, we demonstrate that a model's sensitivity to adversarial
probes can better discriminate between candidate neural encoding models than
prediction accuracy alone. Third, we find that standard models rely on distinct
local coding directions that do not transfer across model architectures.
Finally, we show that adversarial probes from robustified models produce
generalizable and semantically meaningful changes, suggesting that they capture
the local coding dimensions of the visual system. Together, our work shows that
local representational geometry provides a stronger criterion for brain model
evaluation. We also provide empirical grounds for favoring robust models, whose
more stable coding axes not only align better with neural selectivity but also
generate concrete, testable predictions for future experiments.

### [1177] [Consciousness Self and Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23342)
*Robert Worden*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper explores Minimal Phenomenal Experience (MPE) to analyze consciousness in its purer form, particularly considering the role of language as a confounding factor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand consciousness in states with minimal confounding influences and to investigate the role of language and mindfulness.

Method: Analysis of consciousness, language, and emotion through Bayesian pattern matching and Free Energy minimization frameworks.

Result: Identified three human-specific patterns: word patterns of language, self-patterns driving emotions and related to language, and mindful patterns competing with self-patterns.

Conclusion: Mindfulness practice leads to the displacement of self-patterns by mindful patterns, impacting the understanding of MPE states and theories of consciousness.

Abstract: Theories of consciousness depend on data, and it needs to be appropriate
data, without overwhelming confounding factors. The reports of Minimal
Phenomenal Experience (MPE) in [Metzinger 2024] relate to consciousness in a
state purer than everyday consciousness, which may have fewer confounding
factors. This essay suggests that the confounding factors, which are absent or
diminished in MPE states, are related to language. The self which is absent in
mindful states is a product of language. The link between language and MPE
states is demonstrated by reference to the phenomenal reports in [Metzinger
2024]. Language, emotion, and mindfulness are analysed in terms of Bayesian
pattern matching, or equivalently minimisation of Free Energy, using three
types of pattern which are specific to humans. These types are the word
patterns of language, self-patterns which drive our emotions and which are also
a part of language, and mindful patterns. The practice of mindfulness involves
learning mindful patterns, which compete with self-patterns and displace them,
allowing mindful states to occur. Consequences of this picture for theories of
consciousness, and their relation to MPE states, are explored.

*Maria Glushanina,Jeffrey Huang,Michelle McCleod,Brendan Ames,Evie Malaia*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces CEBRA, a novel model for analyzing dyadic EEG data, enabling representations of interpersonal neural dynamics during social interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of modeling neural dynamics in social communication, involving two interacting brains, which requires capturing joint neural activity in structured social contexts.

Method: CEBRA is applied to dyadic EEG hyperscanning data, focusing on learning representations of joint neural activity during structured interactions, identifying roles such as speaker and listener, and capturing behavioral metrics.

Result: CEBRA successfully learns meaningful representations of joint neural activity associated with individual roles and behavioral metrics, demonstrating scalability and the ability for cross-subject generalization.

Conclusion: This work establishes a new paradigm for representation learning in social neuroscience, particularly useful for understanding interpersonal dynamics and with potential applications in clinical contexts.

Abstract: Social communication fundamentally involves at least two interacting brains,
creating a unique modeling problem. We present the first application of
Contrastive Embedding for Behavioral and Neural Analysis (CEBRA) to dyadic EEG
hyperscanning data, extending modeling paradigms to interpersonal neural
dynamics. Using structured social interactions between participants, we
demonstrate that CEBRA can learn meaningful representations of joint neural
activity that captures individual roles (speaker-listener) and other behavioral
metrics. Our approach to characterizing interactions, as opposed to individual
neural responses to stimuli, addresses the key principles of foundational model
development: scalability and cross-subject generalization, opening new
directions for representation learning in social neuroscience and clinical
applications.

### [1179] [EEG-Based Framework for Reflexive and Perceptual Assessment in CLIS: Preliminary Study in Healthy Volunteers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23524)
*Nicoli Leal,Rute Bettencourt,Urbano J. Nunes,Gabriel Pires*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper aims to improve brain-computer interface (BCI) communication for completely locked-in state (CLIS) patients by assessing their cognitive state through neurophysiological reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the limited effectiveness of BCIs in enabling communication for CLIS patients, potentially due to executive function, working memory, and vigilance impairments.

Method: The authors develop paradigms using neural responses (MMN, SSAEP, SSVEP) to assess sensory and perceptual processing, focusing on reflexive and perceptual levels. Pilot testing was conducted with five healthy participants.

Result: The pilot testing validated the feasibility of generating neurophysiological reports for cognitive assessment in CLIS patients.

Conclusion: This approach could enhance the evaluation of CLIS patients' ability to communicate using BCIs by offering a systematic cognitive assessment framework.

Abstract: Despite the general assumption that completely locked-in state (CLIS)
patients remain conscious and aware of their environment, the effectiveness of
brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in facilitating communication has been
limited, as reported both in the literature and in our own findings. This
limitation is likely attributable to impairments in executive functions,
working memory, and vigilance, which appear to hinder the establishment of
reliable BCI-based communication. The main goal of this research is to develop
a neurophysiological report designed to support the evaluation of the cognitive
state of these individuals and determine their ability to interact with BCIs.
To achieve this, we designed a set of paradigms to assess CLIS patients at the
reflexive and perceptual levels, based on neural responses associated with
sensory and perceptual processing, including Mismatch Negativity (MMN), Steady
State Auditory Evoked Potential (SSAEP), and Steady State Visual Evoked
Potential (SSVEP). Pilot testing with five healthy participants demonstrates
the feasibility of generating a neurophysiological report for cognitive
assessment at both levels.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper explores NeuroAI, focusing on integration of biological neural properties and engineered systems to create adaptive, intelligent frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage insights from neuroscience to design advanced AI systems and bridge biological and computational intelligences.

Method: Organizes the NeuroAI field into hardware, software, and wetware domains, and examines advancements in organoid intelligence, neuromorphic computing, and neuro-symbolic learning.

Result: The paper identifies computational frameworks uniting biological and digital systems, showcasing capabilities of SBI in hybrid intelligence.

Conclusion: These integrated systems could revolutionize computation by combining living neural tissues with digital algorithms, enabling new forms of adaptive intelligence.

Abstract: NeuroAI is an emerging field at the intersection of neuroscience and
artificial intelligence, where insights from brain function guide the design of
intelligent systems. A central area within this field is synthetic biological
intelligence (SBI), which combines the adaptive learning properties of
biological neural networks with engineered hardware and software. SBI systems
provide a platform for modeling neural computation, developing biohybrid
architectures, and enabling new forms of embodied intelligence. In this review,
we organize the NeuroAI landscape into three interacting domains: hardware,
software, and wetware. We outline computational frameworks that integrate
biological and non-biological systems and highlight recent advances in organoid
intelligence, neuromorphic computing, and neuro-symbolic learning. These
developments collectively point toward a new class of systems that compute
through interactions between living neural tissue and digital algorithms.

*Haider Al-Tahan,Mayukh Deb,Jenelle Feather,N. Apurva Ratan Murty*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study introduces TopoAudio, a biologically grounded auditory model that achieves high task performance while developing cortical topography similar to the human auditory cortex.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing auditory perception models do not exhibit topographic organization akin to the human auditory cortex despite their high performance in predicting fMRI responses.

Method: The authors adapted a cortical wiring-constraint loss from visual perception and implemented it in TopoAudio, a model trained on cochleagram inputs for auditory tasks, enforcing topographic organization on a 2D cortical sheet.

Result: TopoAudio achieves benchmark-level task accuracy and fMRI prediction performance comparable to non-topographic models, while also developing smooth topographic maps and clustered response modules for acoustic features.

Conclusion: TopoAudio demonstrates that incorporating a wiring-length constraint aligns auditory models closer to biological organization, showcasing the potential of such constraints for biologically plausible machine learning models.

Abstract: The human auditory cortex is topographically organized. Neurons with similar
response properties are spatially clustered, forming smooth maps for acoustic
features such as frequency in early auditory areas, and modular regions
selective for music and speech in higher-order cortex. Yet, evaluations for
current computational models of auditory perception do not measure whether such
topographic structure is present in a candidate model. Here, we show that
cortical topography is not present in the previous best-performing models at
predicting human auditory fMRI responses. To encourage the emergence of
topographic organization, we adapt a cortical wiring-constraint loss originally
designed for visual perception. The new class of topographic auditory models,
TopoAudio, are trained to classify speech, and environmental sounds from
cochleagram inputs, with an added constraint that nearby units on a 2D cortical
sheet develop similar tuning. Despite these additional constraints, TopoAudio
achieves high accuracy on benchmark tasks comparable to the unconstrained
non-topographic baseline models. Further, TopoAudio predicts the fMRI responses
in the brain as well as standard models, but unlike standard models, TopoAudio
develops smooth, topographic maps for tonotopy and amplitude modulation (common
properties of early auditory representation, as well as clustered response
modules for music and speech (higher-order selectivity observed in the human
auditory cortex). TopoAudio is the first end-to-end biologically grounded
auditory model to exhibit emergent topography, and our results emphasize that a
wiring-length constraint can serve as a general-purpose regularization tool to
achieve biologically aligned representations.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Brain Harmony (BrainHarmonix) introduces the first brain foundation model that integrates multimodal neuroimaging data into compact token representations for advanced neuroscience applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified neuroimaging model that integrates structural and functional brain information for better insights and AI-driven neuroscience advancements.

Method: Pretraining a multimodal brain model using two large neuroimaging datasets (structural MRI and functional MRI), followed by modality fusion through shared hub tokens. It includes unique handling of heterogeneous fMRI time series.

Result: BrainHarmonix compresses high-dimensional neuroimaging data into unified 1D tokens and achieves superior performance in diverse downstream tasks such as disorder classification and cognition prediction.

Conclusion: This model marks a significant step towards AI-driven neuroscience, demonstrating strong generalization and outperforming existing approaches in neuroimaging tasks.

Abstract: We present Brain Harmony (BrainHarmonix), the first multimodal brain
foundation model that unifies structural morphology and functional dynamics
into compact 1D token representations. The model was pretrained on two of the
largest neuroimaging datasets to date, encompassing 64,594 T1-weighted
structural MRI 3D volumes (~ 14 million images) and 70,933 functional MRI
(fMRI) time series. BrainHarmonix is grounded in two foundational neuroscience
principles: structure complements function - structural and functional
modalities offer distinct yet synergistic insights into brain organization;
function follows structure - brain functional dynamics are shaped by cortical
morphology. The modular pretraining process involves single-modality training
with geometric pre-alignment followed by modality fusion through shared brain
hub tokens. Notably, our dynamics encoder uniquely handles fMRI time series
with heterogeneous repetition times (TRs), addressing a major limitation in
existing models. BrainHarmonix is also the first to deeply compress
high-dimensional neuroimaging signals into unified, continuous 1D tokens,
forming a compact latent space of the human brain. BrainHarmonix achieves
strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, including
neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorder classification and cognition
prediction - consistently outperforming previous approaches. Our models -
pretrained on 8 H100 GPUs - aim to catalyze a new era of AI-driven neuroscience
powered by large-scale multimodal neuroimaging.

*Jiangnan Zhang,Chengyuan Qian,Wenlian Lu,Gustavo Deco,Weiyang Ding,Jianfeng Feng*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel data-driven framework that transforms observed low-dimensional brain activity into higher-dimensional complex-valued dynamics using principles from Hamiltonian mechanics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the need to better understand functional organization of brain dynamics by embedding low-dimensional observed data into meaningful higher-dimensional representations.

Method: The authors introduce a physics-informed framework that augments observed brain signals with latent 'dark signals,' which act as conjugate momenta in a whole-brain Hamiltonian system. The Hilbert transform is used for signal augmentation, yielding a Schrödinger-like equation for complex-valued brain dynamics.

Result: The framework improves predictive accuracy and fits for both linear and nonlinear brain dynamics, enhances structure-function coupling, recovers intrinsic timescales, and reveals age-related and task-dependent reconfigurations in effective connectivity.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a robust paradigm for studying large-scale brain dynamics, promising new insights into their spatiotemporal organization and functional implications.

Abstract: Recordings of brain activity, such as functional MRI (fMRI), provide
low-dimensional, indirect observations of neural dynamics evolving in
high-dimensional, unobservable spaces. Embedding observed brain dynamics into a
higher-dimensional representation may help reveal functional organization, but
precisely how remains unclear. Hamiltonian mechanics suggests that, by
introducing an additional dimension of conjugate momenta, the dynamical
behaviour of a conservative system can be formulated in a more compact and
mathematically elegant manner. Here we develop a physics-informed, data-driven
framework that lifts whole-brain activity to the complex-valued field.
Specifically, we augment observed signals (generalized coordinates) with latent
``dark signals'' that play the role of conjugate momenta in a whole-brain
Hamiltonian system. We show that the Hilbert transform provides an augmentation
approach with optimal fitting accuracy within this framework, yielding a
Schr\"odinger-like equation governing complex-valued, augmented brain dynamics.
Empirically, this complex-valued model consistently outperforms its real-valued
counterpart, improving short-horizon prediction in the linear regime
(correlation 0.12$\to$0.82) and achieving superior fits under nonlinear,
nonequilibrium dynamics (0.47$\to$0.88). The framework strengthens
structure-function coupling, recovers hierarchical intrinsic timescales, and
yields biologically plausible directed effective connectivity that varies
systematically with age and reconfigures from rest to task via global rescaling
plus targeted rewiring. Together, these results establish a principled,
testable paradigm for network neuroscience and offer transformative insight
into the spatiotemporal organization and functional roles of large-scale brain
dynamics.

### [1184] [Variance-Bounded Evaluation without Ground Truth: VB-Score](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22751)
*Kaihua Ding*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: VB-Score is a novel evaluation metric for machine learning tasks to assess robustness and effectiveness without requiring ground truth labels. It accounts for ambiguity by penalizing variance and rewarding consistent performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation frameworks struggle with tasks lacking ground truth labels or involving ambiguity, limiting their ability to assess robustness under uncertain interpretations.

Method: VB-Score involves generating plausible interpretations for input, assigning probabilities, and evaluating expected success while penalizing variance to measure robustness and effectiveness.

Result: Experiments demonstrate VB-Score's ability to reveal robustness variations in tasks with ambiguous queries or entity-centric retrieval, which are overlooked by traditional metrics.

Conclusion: VB-Score provides a reproducible and label-free evaluation framework that benchmarks machine learning systems in ambiguous or label-scarce scenarios, addressing a critical challenge in the field.

Abstract: Reliable evaluation is a central challenge in machine learning when tasks
lack ground truth labels or involve ambiguity and noise. Conventional
frameworks, rooted in the Cranfield paradigm and label-based metrics, fail in
such cases because they cannot assess how robustly a system performs under
uncertain interpretations. We introduce VB-Score, a variance-bounded evaluation
framework that measures both effectiveness and robustness without requiring
ground truth. Given a query or input, VB-Score enumerates plausible
interpretations, assigns probabilities, and evaluates output by expected
success penalized by variance, rewarding consistent performance across intents.
We provide a formal analysis of VB-Score, establishing range, monotonicity, and
stability properties, and relate it to risk-sensitive measures such as
mean-variance utility. Experiments on ambiguous queries and entity-centric
retrieval tasks show that VB-Score surfaces robustness differences hidden by
conventional metrics. By enabling reproducible, label-free evaluation, VB-Score
offers a principled foundation for benchmarking machine learning systems in
ambiguous or label-scarce domains.

TL;DR: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are tools in explainable AI used to understand how human concepts are encoded in latent model spaces. A probabilistic perspective reveals a vulnerability in prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring how meaningful human-understandable concepts are represented in machine learning model latent spaces and addressing overlooked dependencies.

Method: A probabilistic approach to CAV analysis, introducing mean and covariance metrics for distributional understanding and examining the effects of non-concept distributions.

Result: CAVs are shown to strongly depend on non-concept distributions, revealing a vulnerability and enabling adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The work highlights the need for a systematic study of how non-concept distributions influence the robustness of CAV-based explanations.

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are a tool from explainable AI, offering a
promising approach for understanding how human-understandable concepts are
encoded in a model's latent spaces. They are computed from hidden-layer
activations of inputs belonging either to a concept class or to non-concept
examples. Adopting a probabilistic perspective, the distribution of the
(non-)concept inputs induces a distribution over the CAV, making it a random
vector in the latent space. This enables us to derive mean and covariance for
different types of CAVs, leading to a unified theoretical view. This
probabilistic perspective also reveals a potential vulnerability: CAVs can
strongly depend on the rather arbitrary non-concept distribution, a factor
largely overlooked in prior work. We illustrate this with a simple yet
effective adversarial attack, underscoring the need for a more systematic
study.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a PINN framework for fractional-order SEIRD models to reconstruct epidemic trajectories and infer memory effects and epidemiological parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve epidemic modeling by incorporating long-range memory effects via fractional-order derivatives into SEIRD models.

Method: The framework uses PINNs with Caputo fractional derivatives embedded in residuals through L1 discretization. It combines loss functions for data fit, physics, and initial conditions, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

Result: The framework can reliably recover memory order and parameters under noise for synthetic Mpox data and improves prediction accuracy in analyzing COVID-19 data.

Conclusion: PINNs are effective for capturing memory effects in epidemic dynamics, aiding forecasting and strategies for handling non-Markovian epidemic processes.

Abstract: We develop a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for parameter
estimation in fractional-order SEIRD epidemic models. By embedding the Caputo
fractional derivative into the network residuals via the L1 discretization
scheme, our method simultaneously reconstructs epidemic trajectories and infers
both epidemiological parameters and the fractional memory order $\alpha$. The
fractional formulation extends classical integer-order models by capturing
long-range memory effects in disease progression, incubation, and recovery. Our
framework learns the fractional memory order $\alpha$ as a trainable parameter
while simultaneously estimating the epidemiological rates $(\beta, \sigma,
\gamma, \mu)$. A composite loss combining data misfit, physics residuals, and
initial conditions, with constraints on positivity and population conservation,
ensures both accuracy and biological consistency. Tests on synthetic Mpox data
confirm reliable recovery of $\alpha$ and parameters under noise, while
applications to COVID-19 show that optimal $\alpha \in (0, 1]$ captures memory
effects and improves predictive performance over the classical SEIRD model.
This work establishes PINNs as a robust tool for learning memory effects in
epidemic dynamics, with implications for forecasting, control strategies, and
the analysis of non-Markovian epidemic processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving accurate global ranking recovery from noisy pairwise comparison data.

Method: Adopts a complex-valued data model encoded in phases of a unit-modulus vector along with a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation for SyncRank.

Result: Derives a critical noise threshold for exact recovery and validates it experimentally, showing robustness across different conditions.

Conclusion: The SyncRank algorithm is robust and effective for global ranking recovery under specific noise thresholds, aligning theory with experimental results.

Abstract: We present a theoretical and empirical analysis of the SyncRank algorithm for
recovering a global ranking from noisy pairwise comparisons. By adopting a
complex-valued data model where the true ranking is encoded in the phases of a
unit-modulus vector, we establish a sharp non-asymptotic recovery guarantee for
the associated semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. Our main theorem
characterizes a critical noise threshold - scaling as sigma = O(sqrt(n / log
n)) - below which SyncRank achieves exact ranking recovery with high
probability. Extensive experiments under this model confirm the theoretical
predictions and demonstrate the algorithm's robustness across varying problem
sizes and noise regimes.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper develops the first method for instrumental variable regression (IVaR) under differential privacy, combining theoretical guarantees with practical tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by privacy risks in classical IVaR methods which rely on sensitive data and lack mechanisms to ensure statistically efficient and private algorithms.

Method: It introduces a noisy two-stage gradient descent algorithm that applies zero-concentrated differential privacy through noise injection, along with bounds on privacy, sample size, and complexity.

Result: The method achieves finite-sample convergence and balances accuracy and privacy effectively, validated by theoretical analysis and experiments on synthetic and real data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses privacy risks in IVaR while maintaining statistical performance, providing a provable solution for private regression in linear models.

Abstract: We study instrumental variable regression (IVaR) under differential privacy
constraints. Classical IVaR methods (like two-stage least squares regression)
rely on solving moment equations that directly use sensitive covariates and
instruments, creating significant risks of privacy leakage and posing
challenges in designing algorithms that are both statistically efficient and
differentially private. We propose a noisy two-state gradient descent algorithm
that ensures $\rho$-zero-concentrated differential privacy by injecting
carefully calibrated noise into the gradient updates. Our analysis establishes
finite-sample convergence rates for the proposed method, showing that the
algorithm achieves consistency while preserving privacy. In particular, we
derive precise bounds quantifying the trade-off among privacy parameters,
sample size, and iteration-complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to provide both privacy guarantees and provable convergence
rates for instrumental variable regression in linear models. We further
validate our theoretical findings with experiments on both synthetic and real
datasets, demonstrating that our method offers practical accuracy-privacy
trade-offs.

*Jake S. Rhodes,Adam G. Rustad,Sofia Pelagalli Maia,Evan Thacker,Hyunmi Choi,Jose Gutierrez,Tatjana Rundek,Ben Shaw*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a label-guided method for imputing missing data in time series, aiming to improve classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for imputing missing time series data often fail to utilize label information associated with the data, potentially missing an opportunity to improve classification performance.

Method: The proposed framework performs imputation conditional upon categorical labels using tree-based proximity measures derived from supervised models optimized for classification tasks.

Result: Imputed values using the proposed method enhance the richness of information in time series, leading to better classification accuracy even if the imputed values differ from the true values.

Conclusion: Label-guided data imputation can be valuable for time series classification tasks, improving overall performance through informed imputations.

Abstract: Missing data is a common problem in time series data. Most methods for
imputation ignore label information pertaining to the time series even if that
information exists. In this paper, we provide a framework for missing data
imputation in the context of time series classification, where each time series
is associated with a categorical label. We define a means of imputing missing
values conditional upon labels, the method being guided by powerful, existing
supervised models designed for high accuracy in this task. From each model, we
extract a tree-based proximity measure from which imputation can be applied. We
show that imputation using this method generally provides richer information
leading to higher classification accuracies, despite the imputed values
differing from the true values.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for uncertainty quantification in random forests using out-of-bag (OOB) errors and proximity measures, producing prediction intervals and trust scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to refine uncertainty quantification in machine learning, particularly within random forests, where predictive reliability is crucial for high-stakes applications.

Method: The proposed method leverages out-of-bag errors and proximity measures within random forests to construct localized distributions for regression prediction intervals and classification trust scores.

Result: The approach demonstrates improved accuracy-rejection AUC scores for classification and allows configurable coverage levels for regression, enhancing reliability and flexibility in predictions.

Conclusion: The method improves predictive reliability, helps achieve desired uncertainty levels, and is particularly valuable for high-stakes decision-making scenarios.

Abstract: In machine learning, uncertainty quantification helps assess the reliability
of model predictions, which is important in high-stakes scenarios. Traditional
approaches often emphasize predictive accuracy, but there is a growing focus on
incorporating uncertainty measures. This paper addresses localized uncertainty
quantification in random forests. While current methods often rely on quantile
regression or Monte Carlo techniques, we propose a new approach using naturally
occurring test sets and similarity measures (proximities) typically viewed as
byproducts of random forests. Specifically, we form localized distributions of
OOB errors around nearby points, defined using the proximities, to create
prediction intervals for regression and trust scores for classification. By
varying the number of nearby points, our intervals can be adjusted to achieve
the desired coverage while retaining the flexibility that reflects the
certainty of individual predictions. For classification, excluding points
identified as unclassifiable by our method generally enhances the accuracy of
the model and provides higher accuracy-rejection AUC scores than competing
methods.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces an unsupervised conformal inference framework for managing uncertainty in black-box LLMs lacking token-level probability or true labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of managing uncertainty in deploying black-box LLMs, especially when true labels or token-level probabilities are unavailable.

Method: The framework uses an atypical score from the response-embedding Gram matrix, a UCP with bootstrapping for quantile precision (BB-UCP), and conformal alignment for strictness calibration.

Result: Compared to existing approaches, the method achieves near-nominal coverage, more stable thresholds, reduced hallucinations, and outperforms similar lightweight detectors.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a label-free, API-compatible solution for test-time filtering in LLMs, making geometric signals into goal-aligned decisions efficiently.

Abstract: Deploying black-box LLMs requires managing uncertainty in the absence of
token-level probability or true labels. We propose introducing an unsupervised
conformal inference framework for generation, which integrates: generative
models, incorporating: (i) an LLM-compatible atypical score derived from
response-embedding Gram matrix, (ii) UCP combined with a bootstrapping variant
(BB-UCP) that aggregates residuals to refine quantile precision while
maintaining distribution-free, finite-sample coverage, and (iii) conformal
alignment, which calibrates a single strictness parameter $\tau$ so a user
predicate (e.g., factuality lift) holds on unseen batches with probability $\ge
1-\alpha$. Across different benchmark datasets, our gates achieve
close-to-nominal coverage and provide tighter, more stable thresholds than
split UCP, while consistently reducing the severity of hallucination,
outperforming lightweight per-response detectors with similar computational
demands. The result is a label-free, API-compatible gate for test-time
filtering that turns geometric signals into calibrated, goal-aligned decisions.

### [1192] [Sparse Deep Additive Model with Interactions: Enhancing Interpretability and Predictability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23068)
*Yi-Ting Hung,Li-Hsiang Lin,Vince D. Calhoun*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The Sparse Deep Additive Model with Interactions (SDAMI) is a deep learning framework that balances interpretability and predictive accuracy through structured modeling of main and interaction effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for interpretable and personalized machine learning models that perform well on small or moderate samples, handle high-dimensional features, and provide accurate predictions.

Method: SDAMI combines sparsity-driven feature selection, a two-phase strategy leveraging the Effect Footprint concept, and deep subnetworks for flexible modeling of main and interaction effects. It uses structured regularization methods like group lasso to separate genuine effects.

Result: The proposed model successfully recovers effect structures in extensive simulations and proves its adaptability in various domains, such as reliability analysis, neuroscience, and medical diagnostics.

Conclusion: SDAMI offers a reliable and interpretable framework for high-dimensional, nonlinear modeling, suitable for real-world applications while outperforming classical additive models in predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning highlight the need for personalized models
that can learn from small or moderate samples, handle high dimensional
features, and remain interpretable. To address this challenge, we propose the
Sparse Deep Additive Model with Interactions (SDAMI), a framework that combines
sparsity driven feature selection with deep subnetworks for flexible function
approximation. Unlike conventional deep learning models, which often function
as black boxes, SDAMI explicitly disentangles main effects and interaction
effects to enhance interpretability. At the same time, its deep additive
structure achieves higher predictive accuracy than classical additive models.
Central to SDAMI is the concept of an Effect Footprint, which assumes that
higher order interactions project marginally onto main effects. Guided by this
principle, SDAMI adopts a two stage strategy: first, identify strong main
effects that implicitly carry information about important interactions. second,
exploit this information through structured regularization such as group lasso
to distinguish genuine main effects from interaction effects. For each selected
main effect, SDAMI constructs a dedicated subnetwork, enabling nonlinear
function approximation while preserving interpretability and providing a

### [1193] [Statistical Inference for Gradient Boosting Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23127)
*Haimo Fang,Kevin Tan,Giles Hooker*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a statistical inference framework for gradient boosting, incorporating dropout and parallel training, enabling confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient boosting lacks established methods for statistical inference and uncertainty quantification despite its popularity.

Method: The study integrates dropout, parallel training, and a recent regularization procedure to establish a central limit theorem for gradient boosting.

Result: Enhanced signal recovery, improved performance, and algorithms capable of producing confidence intervals and supporting hypothesis tests were observed.

Conclusion: The proposed framework expands gradient boosting capabilities into statistical inference while achieving high performance and validation of its techniques.

Abstract: Gradient boosting is widely popular due to its flexibility and predictive
accuracy. However, statistical inference and uncertainty quantification for
gradient boosting remain challenging and under-explored. We propose a unified
framework for statistical inference in gradient boosting regression. Our
framework integrates dropout or parallel training with a recently proposed
regularization procedure that allows for a central limit theorem (CLT) for
boosting. With these enhancements, we surprisingly find that increasing the
dropout rate and the number of trees grown in parallel at each iteration
substantially enhances signal recovery and overall performance. Our resulting
algorithms enjoy similar CLTs, which we use to construct built-in confidence
intervals, prediction intervals, and rigorous hypothesis tests for assessing
variable importance. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithms
perform well, interpolate between regularized boosting and random forests, and
confirm the validity of their built-in statistical inference procedures.

### [1194] [Conditional Risk Minimization with Side Information: A Tractable, Universal Optimal Transport Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23128)
*Xinqiao Xie,Jonathan Yu-Meng Li*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a universal framework for distributionally robust conditional risk minimization using optimal transport methods to address challenges in high-stakes decision-making with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-stakes decisions often require conditional risk assessments, but constructing reliable conditional distributions from limited data is notoriously difficult.

Method: The paper formulates a universal framework based on a novel union-ball approach in optimal transport, enabling convex reformulations and scalable cutting-plane algorithms.

Result: The framework unifies existing methods, enhances interpretability, ensures tractability for major risk functionals, and demonstrates practical applicability in portfolio optimization.

Conclusion: The framework resolves limitations of existing approaches, enabling robust conditional risk minimization across diverse high-stakes contexts and revealing deep structural connections in the field.

Abstract: Conditional risk minimization arises in high-stakes decisions where risk must
be assessed in light of side information, such as stressed economic conditions,
specific customer profiles, or other contextual covariates. Constructing
reliable conditional distributions from limited data is notoriously difficult,
motivating a series of optimal-transport-based proposals that address this
uncertainty in a distributionally robust manner. Yet these approaches remain
fragmented, each constrained by its own limitations: some rely on point
estimates or restrictive structural assumptions, others apply only to narrow
classes of risk measures, and their structural connections are unclear. We
introduce a universal framework for distributionally robust conditional risk
minimization, built on a novel union-ball formulation in optimal transport.
This framework offers three key advantages: interpretability, by subsuming
existing methods as special cases and revealing their deep structural links;
tractability, by yielding convex reformulations for virtually all major risk
functionals studied in the literature; and scalability, by supporting
cutting-plane algorithms for large-scale conditional risk problems.
Applications to portfolio optimization with rank-dependent expected utility
highlight the practical effectiveness of the framework, with conditional models
converging to optimal solutions where unconditional ones clearly do not.

### [1195] [A Generative Model for Controllable Feature Heterophily in Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23230)
*Haoyu Wang,Renyuan Ma,Gonzalo Mateos,Luana Ruiz*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a generative framework for graph signals enabling explicit control over feature heterophily, supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for explicit control and modeling of feature heterophily, which plays a crucial role in graph learning methods.

Method: The framework employs a graphon-based random graph generator, Gaussian node features, and a smooth spectral function of the rescaled Laplacian, supported by theoretical analysis.

Result: Theoretical results include a concentration bound for empirical heterophily and convergence guarantees for feature heterophily under the proposed model.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical and theoretically justified mechanism for tuning feature homophily/heterophily, validated through experiments with graphs and spectral filters.

Abstract: We introduce a principled generative framework for graph signals that enables
explicit control of feature heterophily, a key property underlying the
effectiveness of graph learning methods. Our model combines a Lipschitz
graphon-based random graph generator with Gaussian node features filtered
through a smooth spectral function of the rescaled Laplacian. We establish new
theoretical guarantees: (i) a concentration result for the empirical
heterophily score; and (ii) almost-sure convergence of the feature heterophily
measure to a deterministic functional of the graphon degree profile, based on a
graphon-limit law for polynomial averages of Laplacian eigenvalues. These
results elucidate how the interplay between the graphon and the filter governs
the limiting level of feature heterophily, providing a tunable mechanism for
data modeling and generation. We validate the theory through experiments
demonstrating precise control of homophily across graph families and spectral
filters.

### [1196] [Flow Matching for Robust Simulation-Based Inference under Model Misspecification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23385)
*Pierre-Louis Ruhlmann,Pedro L. C. Rodrigues,Michael Arbel,Florence Forbes*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Flow Matching Corrected Posterior Estimation (FMCPE) improves simulation-based inference (SBI) robustness by adjusting simulator-trained posteriors using a few real samples, overcoming model misspecification issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model misspecifications in simulation-based inference (SBI) lead to biased or unreliable posterior estimates, necessitating a method to align simulated models with real data.

Method: FMCPE trains a posterior estimator on simulated data and refinements are done using flow matching and real calibration samples, without knowing the model mismatch explicitly.

Result: FMCPE enhances inference accuracy and uncertainty calibration across synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming standard SBI approaches.

Conclusion: FMCPE effectively combines the scalability of SBI with better robustness to model misspecifications, ensuring accurate and efficient parameter estimation.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is transforming experimental sciences by
enabling parameter estimation in complex non-linear models from simulated data.
A persistent challenge, however, is model misspecification: simulators are only
approximations of reality, and mismatches between simulated and real data can
yield biased or overconfident posteriors. We address this issue by introducing
Flow Matching Corrected Posterior Estimation (FMCPE), a framework that
leverages the flow matching paradigm to refine simulation-trained posterior
estimators using a small set of real calibration samples. Our approach proceeds
in two stages: first, a posterior approximator is trained on abundant simulated
data; second, flow matching transports its predictions toward the true
posterior supported by real observations, without requiring explicit knowledge
of the misspecification. This design enables FMCPE to combine the scalability
of SBI with robustness to distributional shift. Across synthetic benchmarks and
real-world datasets, we show that our proposal consistently mitigates the
effects of misspecification, delivering improved inference accuracy and
uncertainty calibration compared to standard SBI baselines, while remaining
computationally efficient.

*Yidong Zhou,Su I Iao,Hans-Georg Müller*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes E2M, a deep learning framework specialized in predicting non-Euclidean outputs like probability distributions or networks, ensuring geometry-aware predictions without parametric constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern applications require regression methods for structured outputs in general metric spaces, where traditional vector space approaches fail.

Method: E2M uses a weighted Fréchet mean approach, leveraging neural networks to predict outputs by preserving the geometry of metric spaces.

Result: E2M outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially with larger datasets, in simulations and real-world examples like mortality distributions and taxi networks.

Conclusion: E2M is theoretically sound, flexible, and practically effective for metric space-valued regression tasks.

Abstract: Many modern applications involve predicting structured, non-Euclidean outputs
such as probability distributions, networks, and symmetric positive-definite
matrices. These outputs are naturally modeled as elements of general metric
spaces, where classical regression techniques that rely on vector space
structure no longer apply. We introduce E2M (End-to-End Metric regression), a
deep learning framework for predicting metric space-valued outputs. E2M
performs prediction via a weighted Fr\'echet means over training outputs, where
the weights are learned by a neural network conditioned on the input. This
construction provides a principled mechanism for geometry-aware prediction that
avoids surrogate embeddings and restrictive parametric assumptions, while fully
preserving the intrinsic geometry of the output space. We establish theoretical
guarantees, including a universal approximation theorem that characterizes the
expressive capacity of the model and a convergence analysis of the
entropy-regularized training objective. Through extensive simulations involving
probability distributions, networks, and symmetric positive-definite matrices,
we show that E2M consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, with its
advantages becoming more pronounced at larger sample sizes. Applications to
human mortality distributions and New York City taxi networks further
demonstrate the flexibility and practical utility of the framework.

*Samuel Willis,Alexandru I. Stere,Dragos D. Margineantu,Henry T. Oldroyd,John A. Fozard,Carl Henrik Ek,Henry Moss,Erik Bodin*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces surrogate latent spaces for enabling controlled sampling in generative AI models, offering interpretable, low-cost, and generalized applicability across multiple modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models struggle to fulfill task-specific constraints, which limits their usability for controlled applications like experimental design or creative content generation.

Method: The paper proposes surrogate latent spaces—non-parametric, low-dimensional Euclidean embeddings derived from generative models. Features can be defined via examples, and optimization algorithms can then be used to navigate these spaces.

Result: This method operates efficiently across different modalities (images, audio, video, structured objects) without additional computational burden and provides architecture-agnostic controls.

Conclusion: Surrogate latent spaces introduce an interpretable, computationally efficient, and modality-agnostic approach to control outputs of generative models, making them versatile for complex downstream tasks.

Abstract: Modern generative AI models such as diffusion and flow matching can sample
from rich data distributions, but many downstream tasks -- such as experimental
design or creative content generation -- require a higher level of control than
unconstrained sampling. The challenge is to efficiently identify outputs that
are both probable under the model and satisfy task-specific constraints. We
address this by introducing surrogate latent spaces: non-parametric,
low-dimensional Euclidean embeddings that can be extracted from any generative
model without additional training. The axes in the Euclidean space can be
defined via examples, providing a simple and interpretable approach to define
custom latent spaces that both express intended features and are convenient to
use in downstream tasks. The representation is Euclidean and has controllable
dimensionality, permitting direct application of standard optimisation
algorithms to traverse the outputs of generative models. Our approach is
architecture-agnostic, incurs almost no additional computational cost, and
generalises across modalities, including images, audio, videos, and structured
objects like proteins.

### [1199] [Singleton-Optimized Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24095)
*Tao Wang,Yan Sun,Edgar Dobriban*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Singleton-Optimized Conformal Prediction (SOCOP) method to prioritize singleton predictions while maintaining small prediction set sizes, showing substantial improvements in singleton occurrence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conformal prediction methods often yield large prediction sets, which are not practical in scenarios requiring unambiguous decisions like singleton outcomes.

Method: The authors propose a new nonconformity score and a reformulated optimization problem, optimized via an efficient geometric algorithm, enabling SOCOP to generate singleton predictions for K-class problems in O(K) time.

Result: Experiments on image classification and LLM-based question-answering show SOCOP significantly increases singleton frequency, sometimes by over 20%, and has minimal impact on the average prediction set size.

Conclusion: SOCOP provides a practical solution for improving singleton predictions in conformal prediction while maintaining efficiency and prediction set compactness.

Abstract: Conformal prediction can be used to construct prediction sets that cover the
true outcome with a desired probability, but can sometimes lead to large
prediction sets that are costly in practice. The most useful outcome is a
singleton prediction-an unambiguous decision-yet existing efficiency-oriented
methods primarily optimize average set size. Motivated by this, we propose a
new nonconformity score that aims to minimize the probability of producing
non-singleton sets. Starting from a non-convex constrained optimization problem
as a motivation, we provide a geometric reformulation and associated algorithm
for computing the nonconformity score and associated split conformal prediction
sets in O(K) time for K-class problems. Using this score in split conformal
prediction leads to our proposed Singleton-Optimized Conformal Prediction
(SOCOP) method. We evaluate our method in experiments on image classification
and LLM multiple-choice question-answering, comparing with standard
nonconformity scores such as the (negative) label probability estimates and
their cumulative distribution function; both of which are motivated by
optimizing length. The results show that SOCOP increases singleton frequency
(sometimes by over 20%) compared to the above scores, with minimal impact on
average set size.

### [1200] [ActiveCQ: Active Estimation of Causal Quantities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24293)
*Erdun Gao,Dino Sejdinovic*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a sample-efficient framework for actively estimating various causal quantities using Gaussian Processes and eliminates the need for explicit density estimation. It uses acquisition strategies based on posterior uncertainty and shows improvements over baselines in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal estimation often requires large datasets, leading to high costs, especially when measuring individual outcomes. The paper aims to develop a sample-efficient approach to reduce these costs and expand beyond traditional focuses like the conditional average treatment effect.

Method: The authors formalize the broader task of active causal estimation, leveraging Gaussian Processes to model regression functions, and explore methods for distribution estimation using conditional mean embeddings or explicit density estimators. Acquisition strategies are derived using measures like information gain and variance reduction.

Result: Simulated and semi-synthetic experiments reveal significant improvements with the proposed framework in terms of sample efficiency and estimation accuracy compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The unified framework provides a principled and adaptive approach to actively estimate causal quantities. It is more sample-efficient and generalizes well to various causal inference problems, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Estimating causal quantities (CQs) typically requires large datasets, which
can be expensive to obtain, especially when measuring individual outcomes is
costly. This challenge highlights the importance of sample-efficient active
learning strategies. To address the narrow focus of prior work on the
conditional average treatment effect, we formalize the broader task of Actively
estimating Causal Quantities (ActiveCQ) and propose a unified framework for
this general problem. Built upon the insight that many CQs are integrals of
regression functions, our framework models the regression function with a
Gaussian Process. For the distribution component, we explore both a baseline
using explicit density estimators and a more integrated method using
conditional mean embeddings in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This latter
approach offers key advantages: it bypasses explicit density estimation,
operates within the same function space as the GP, and adaptively refines the
distributional model after each update. Our framework enables the principled
derivation of acquisition strategies from the CQ's posterior uncertainty; we
instantiate this principle with two utility functions based on information gain
and total variance reduction. A range of simulated and semi-synthetic
experiments demonstrate that our principled framework significantly outperforms
relevant baselines, achieving substantial gains in sample efficiency across a
variety of CQs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method that aggregates various representation learning techniques to boost downstream task performance, demonstrating consistent improvements across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing representation learning techniques often capture limited aspects of data, risking the omission of essential insights for downstream tasks.

Method: A flexible representation learning framework that combines diverse approaches using surrogate loss functions, ensuring computational efficiency. The method theoretically guarantees optimal performance and model selection.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed method consistently outperforms baseline machine learning models in diverse tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed aggregated representation learning method is effective, versatile, and applicable across various real-world machine learning scenarios.

Abstract: Representation learning is a key technique in modern machine learning that
enables models to identify meaningful patterns in complex data. However,
different methods tend to extract distinct aspects of the data, and relying on
a single approach may overlook important insights relevant to downstream tasks.
This paper proposes a performance-enhanced aggregated representation learning
method, which combines multiple representation learning approaches to improve
the performance of downstream tasks. The framework is designed to be general
and flexible, accommodating a wide range of loss functions commonly used in
machine learning models. To ensure computational efficiency, we use surrogate
loss functions to facilitate practical weight estimation. Theoretically, we
prove that our method asymptotically achieves optimal performance in downstream
tasks, meaning that the risk of our predictor is asymptotically equivalent to
the theoretical minimum. Additionally, we derive that our method asymptotically
assigns nonzero weights to correctly specified models. We evaluate our method
on diverse tasks by comparing it with advanced machine learning models. The
experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
baseline methods, showing its effectiveness and broad applicability in
real-world machine learning scenarios.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new framework for recognizing ranking structures in preference-based data, integrating temporal penalties and a new objective function for structural change detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preference-based data often appear complex and noisy, concealing homogeneous structures that require identification.

Method: The paper combines dynamic ranking group identification (using temporal penalties in a Bradley-Terry model) with a novel objective function, dynamic programming algorithm, properties of a random design matrix, and a group inverse technique to detect structural changes and quantify uncertainty.

Result: The framework demonstrates consistency in recognizing ranking groups and structural changes theoretically, backed by experiments on synthetic and real-world data for practical utility.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is robust and interpretable, offering a consistent and effective approach to analyzing preference-based data and detecting structural changes.

Abstract: Preference-based data often appear complex and noisy but may conceal
underlying homogeneous structures. This paper introduces a novel framework of
ranking structure recognition for preference-based data. We first develop an
approach to identify dynamic ranking groups by incorporating temporal penalties
into a spectral estimation for the celebrated Bradley-Terry model. To detect
structural changes, we introduce an innovative objective function and present a
practicable algorithm based on dynamic programming. Theoretically, we establish
the consistency of ranking group recognition by exploiting properties of a
random `design matrix' induced by a reversible Markov chain. We also tailor a
group inverse technique to quantify the uncertainty in item ability estimates.
Additionally, we prove the consistency of structure change recognition,
ensuring the robustness of the proposed framework. Experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the practical utility and
interpretability of our approach.

TL;DR: This paper provides a quantitative analysis of shallow neural networks' convergence to Gaussian processes as width increases, using polynomial decay bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies are mostly qualitative about convergence in infinite-width limit neural networks, with limited precise quantitative estimates, especially during training.

Method: The paper employs quadratic Wasserstein distance to establish upper bounds for approximation errors, analyzing the influence of width, input dimension, and training dynamics.

Result: Explicit upper bounds show polynomial decay of approximation error with increasing network width, while correlating architectural and training parameters with convergence.

Conclusion: Finite-width estimates enable rigorous quantification of convergence and error evolution for training shallow neural networks.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the quantitative convergence of shallow neural
networks trained via gradient descent to their associated Gaussian processes in
the infinite-width limit.
  While previous work has established qualitative convergence under broad
settings, precise, finite-width estimates remain limited, particularly during
training.
  We provide explicit upper bounds on the quadratic Wasserstein distance
between the network output and its Gaussian approximation at any training time
$t \ge 0$, demonstrating polynomial decay with network width.
  Our results quantify how architectural parameters, such as width and input
dimension, influence convergence, and how training dynamics affect the
approximation error.

### [1204] [MAD: Manifold Attracted Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24710)
*Dennis Elbrächter,Giovanni S. Alberti,Matteo Santacesaria*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a modification for score-based diffusion models to handle scenarios where training data is noisy. This modification allows for the generation of noiseless samples using an efficiently implementable extended score approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the challenge of generating noiseless samples when the training data includes noise. The authors aim to address this using the manifold hypothesis, which posits that meaningful data lies near a low-dimensional manifold within a high-dimensional space.

Method: The proposed method uses an extended score, which targets reducing low magnitude variations caused by noise while preserving the meaningful variations of the desired distribution. This is achieved through efficiently computing the approximation from the standard score.

Result: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the extended score approach through experiments on toy problems, synthetic data, and real data. Results indicate that the method can successfully reduce noise and generate clean samples.

Conclusion: The proposed modification improves the capacity of score-based diffusion models to handle noisy training data, supporting the generation of clean and meaningful samples through alignment with the manifold hypothesis.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models are a highly effective method for generating
samples from a distribution of images. We consider scenarios where the training
data comes from a noisy version of the target distribution, and present an
efficiently implementable modification of the inference procedure to generate
noiseless samples. Our approach is motivated by the manifold hypothesis,
according to which meaningful data is concentrated around some low-dimensional
manifold of a high-dimensional ambient space. The central idea is that noise
manifests as low magnitude variation in off-manifold directions in contrast to
the relevant variation of the desired distribution which is mostly confined to
on-manifold directions. We introduce the notion of an extended score and show
that, in a simplified setting, it can be used to reduce small variations to
zero, while leaving large variations mostly unchanged. We describe how its
approximation can be computed efficiently from an approximation to the standard
score and demonstrate its efficacy on toy problems, synthetic data, and real
data.

*Xiang Li,Zebang Shen,Ya-Ping Hsieh,Niao He*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes that the success of score-based methods comes from learning the data manifold rather than the full data distribution. This shift to geometric learning, instead of distributional learning, offers superior practicality and error tolerance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Score-based methods like diffusion models have traditionally aimed at learning the data distribution in low-noise settings, but their challenges call for an alternative approach.

Method: The authors analyze scores in the low-noise regime and demonstrate that information related to the data manifold is exponentially stronger than information about the full distribution. They propose geometric learning as a more practical and robust alternative.

Result: The paper highlights three implications: i) diffusion models concentrate on data support with a more tolerable score error; ii) uniform distribution on the data manifold is easier to learn; iii) maximum entropy priors in Bayesian inverse problems demonstrate better score tolerance.

Conclusion: A paradigm shift from distributional to geometric learning significantly enhances error tolerance and practical aspects in applications like diffusion models and Bayesian inverse problems.

Abstract: Score-based methods, such as diffusion models and Bayesian inverse problems,
are often interpreted as learning the data distribution in the low-noise limit
($\sigma \to 0$). In this work, we propose an alternative perspective: their
success arises from implicitly learning the data manifold rather than the full
distribution. Our claim is based on a novel analysis of scores in the
small-$\sigma$ regime that reveals a sharp separation of scales: information
about the data manifold is $\Theta(\sigma^{-2})$ stronger than information
about the distribution. We argue that this insight suggests a paradigm shift
from the less practical goal of distributional learning to the more attainable
task of geometric learning, which provably tolerates $O(\sigma^{-2})$ larger
errors in score approximation. We illustrate this perspective through three
consequences: i) in diffusion models, concentration on data support can be
achieved with a score error of $o(\sigma^{-2})$, whereas recovering the
specific data distribution requires a much stricter $o(1)$ error; ii) more
surprisingly, learning the uniform distribution on the manifold-an especially
structured and useful object-is also $O(\sigma^{-2})$ easier; and iii) in
Bayesian inverse problems, the maximum entropy prior is $O(\sigma^{-2})$ more
robust to score errors than generic priors. Finally, we validate our
theoretical findings with preliminary experiments on large-scale models,
including Stable Diffusion.

TL;DR: This paper uses tools from various fields to study single-head tied-attention layers trained on synthetic sequence tasks, finding sharp asymptotics, spectral distributions of weights, and the effects of nuclear-norm regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically analyze the empirical risk minimization and associated properties of single-head tied-attention layers, addressing inductive biases and trends in large-scale transformer models.

Method: The study draws on random matrix theory, spin-glass physics, and approximate message passing, combined with synthetic high-dimensional sequence tasks and the attention-indexed model.

Result: Sharp asymptotics for errors, location of thresholds for interpolation and recovery, and spectral analysis of weight matrices were derived. Weight decay favors low-rank regularization, influencing parameterization comparisons.

Conclusion: The paper reveals theoretical insights consistent with observed phenomena in large transformer models, particularly the effect of factorized parameterization and implicit biases.

Abstract: We study empirical risk minimization in a single-head tied-attention layer
trained on synthetic high-dimensional sequence tasks, given by the recently
introduced attention-indexed model. Using tools from random matrix theory,
spin-glass physics, and approximate message passing, we derive sharp
asymptotics for training and test errors, locate interpolation and recovery
thresholds, and characterize the limiting spectral distribution of the learned
weights. Weight decay induces an implicit nuclear-norm regularization, favoring
low-rank query and key matrices. Leveraging this, we compare the standard
factorized training of query and key matrices with a direct parameterization in
which their product is trained element-wise, revealing the inductive bias
introduced by the factorized form. Remarkably, the predicted spectral
distribution echoes empirical trends reported in large-scale transformers,
offering a theoretical perspective consistent with these phenomena.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a metric for comparing dynamical systems using operator eigenvalues and spectral projectors, leveraging optimal transport.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in analyzing the geometry of dynamical systems from trajectory data and to provide improved comparison methods.

Method: Developed a metric based on distributions of joint operator eigenvalues and spectral projectors, using optimal transport, with invariance to trajectory sampling frequencies.

Result: The proposed metric outperformed standard operator-based distances in tasks like dimensionality reduction and classification, and enabled meaningful interpolation between systems.

Conclusion: The novel metric is computationally efficient, robust, and beneficial for understanding and comparing nonlinear dynamical systems in machine learning contexts.

Abstract: The geometry of dynamical systems estimated from trajectory data is a major
challenge for machine learning applications. Koopman and transfer operators
provide a linear representation of nonlinear dynamics through their spectral
decomposition, offering a natural framework for comparison. We propose a novel
approach representing each system as a distribution of its joint operator
eigenvalues and spectral projectors and defining a metric between systems
leveraging optimal transport. The proposed metric is invariant to the sampling
frequency of trajectories. It is also computationally efficient, supported by
finite-sample convergence guarantees, and enables the computation of Fr\'echet
means, providing interpolation between dynamical systems. Experiments on
simulated and real-world datasets show that our approach consistently
outperforms standard operator-based distances in machine learning applications,
including dimensionality reduction and classification, and provides meaningful
interpolation between dynamical systems.

TL;DR: The paper addresses optimizing noisy black-box functions using Bayesian Optimization (BO) by exploiting symmetries through a novel PSD-projected max kernel, improving efficiency and regret performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency of Bayesian Optimization (BO) by incorporating symmetries in the optimization of noisy, expensive black-box functions, addressing the non-PSD limitation of max kernels.

Method: The authors propose a positive semidefinite (PSD) projection of the max kernel to make it applicable to BO, without increasing computational complexity.

Result: The proposed PSD-projected max kernel significantly reduces regret compared to existing invariant and non-invariant kernels on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: Revisiting group invariances with the PSD-projected max kernel improves BO performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful framework for optimizing noisy,
expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions. When the objective exhibits
invariances under a group action, exploiting these symmetries can substantially
improve BO efficiency. While using maximum similarity across group orbits has
long been considered in other domains, the fact that the max kernel is not
positive semidefinite (PSD) has prevented its use in BO. In this work, we
revisit this idea by considering a PSD projection of the max kernel. Compared
to existing invariant (and non-invariant) kernels, we show it achieves
significantly lower regret on both synthetic and real-world BO benchmarks,
without increasing computational complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interplay between statistical efficiency, optimization geometry, and initialization in recovering orthogonally decomposable tensors.

Method: The authors focus on perturbation bounds, analyze non-convex optimization landscapes, and investigate initialization strategies for iterative algorithms.

Result: They establish scenarios where efficient algorithms meet statistical limits and identify barriers where these limits aren't achievable.

Conclusion: Initialization plays a critical role, with the paper providing insights into overcoming computational challenges and improving robustness under noise.

Abstract: We study spectral learning for orthogonally decomposable (odeco) tensors,
emphasizing the interplay between statistical limits, optimization geometry,
and initialization. Unlike matrices, recovery for odeco tensors does not hinge
on eigengaps, yielding improved robustness under noise. While iterative methods
such as tensor power iterations can be statistically efficient, initialization
emerges as the main computational bottleneck. We investigate perturbation
bounds, non-convex optimization analysis, and initialization strategies,
clarifying when efficient algorithms attain statistical limits and when
fundamental barriers remain.

### [1210] [Stable and Interpretable Jet Physics with IRC-Safe Equivariant Feature Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22059)
*Partha Konar,Vishal S. Ngairangbam,Michael Spannowsky,Deepanshu Srivastava*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates graph neural networks with physics-motivated designs for jet classification, emphasizing their interpretability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the interpretability of machine learning models in collider physics, focusing on understanding their learned features and connections to QCD observables.

Method: The study designs message-passing graph neural networks that incorporate IRC safety and E(2)/O(2) equivariance, and compares these against baseline models using simulated datasets.

Result: Physics-aware networks demonstrate enhanced stability, robustness to soft emissions, and interpretable latent structures, linking learned representations to established jet observables via Energy Flow Polynomials.

Conclusion: Embedding physics-based constraints improves both the robustness and interpretability of machine learning models, making them more aligned with QCD structures and useful for collider physics.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in jet classification tasks,
yet a key challenge remains: understanding what these models learn and how
their features relate to known QCD observables. Improving interpretability is
essential for building robust and trustworthy machine learning tools in
collider physics. To address this challenge, we investigate graph neural
networks for quark-gluon discrimination, systematically incorporating
physics-motivated inductive biases. In particular, we design message-passing
architectures that enforce infrared and collinear (IRC) safety, as well as E(2)
and O(2) equivariance in the rapidity-azimuth plane. Using simulated jet
datasets, we compare these networks against unconstrained baselines in terms of
classification performance, robustness to soft emissions, and latent
representation structures. Our analysis shows that physics-aware networks are
more stable across training instances and distribute their latent variance
across multiple interpretable directions. By regressing Energy Flow Polynomials
onto the leading principal components, we establish a direct correspondence
between learned representations and established IRC-safe jet observables. These
results demonstrate that embedding symmetry and safety constraints not only
improves robustness but also grounds network representations in known QCD
structures, providing a principled approach toward interpretable deep learning
in collider physics.

### [1211] [CryptoSRAM: Enabling High-Throughput Cryptography on MCUs via In-SRAM Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22986)
*Jingyao Zhang,Elaheh Sadredini*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CryptoSRAM, an architecture that performs cryptographic operations directly within MCU's SRAM to improve performance and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT devices based on MCUs need secure and efficient cryptographic processing, but current solutions struggle with data movement overhead.

Method: Repurposing SRAM into a massively parallel processing architecture integrated seamlessly with MCU systems, mitigating data movement issues.

Result: CryptoSRAM achieves throughput improvements of up to 74x and 67x for AES and SHA3, and up to 6x better performance than existing hardware accelerators for AES.

Conclusion: CryptoSRAM offers a viable and efficient solution for secure communication in IoT systems with minimal hardware modifications.

Abstract: Secure communication is a critical requirement for Internet of Things (IoT)
devices, which are often based on Microcontroller Units (MCUs). Current
cryptographic solutions, which rely on software libraries or dedicated hardware
accelerators, are fundamentally limited by the performance and energy costs of
data movement between memory and processing units. This paper introduces
CryptoSRAM, an in-SRAM computing architecture that performs cryptographic
operations directly within the MCU's standard SRAM array. By repurposing the
memory array into a massively parallel processing fabric, CryptoSRAM eliminates
the data movement bottleneck. This approach is well-suited to MCUs, which
utilize physical addressing and Direct Memory Access (DMA) to manage SRAM,
allowing for seamless integration with minimal hardware overhead. Our analysis
shows that for common cryptographic kernels, CryptoSRAM achieves throughput
improvements of up to 74$\times$ and 67$\times$ for AES and SHA3, respectively,
compared to a software implementation. Furthermore, our solution delivers up to
6$\times$ higher throughput than existing hardware accelerators for AES.
CryptoSRAM demonstrates a viable and efficient architecture for secure
communication in next-generation IoT systems.

### [1212] [FedBit: Accelerating Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning via Bit-Interleaved Packing and Cross-Layer Co-Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23091)
*Xiangchen Meng,Yangdi Lyu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FedBit enhances federated learning with hardware/software optimizations for fully homomorphic encryption, reducing overhead and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the high computational and communication overhead caused by homomorphic encryption in federated learning systems.

Method: FedBit combines a co-designed framework using bit-interleaved data packing and a dedicated FPGA accelerator optimized for the BFV encryption scheme.

Result: FedBit delivers a performance boost of two orders of magnitude in encryption processing, reduces communication overhead by 60.7%, and retains high accuracy in federated learning.

Conclusion: FedBit proves to be an efficient solution for resource-intensive federated learning with homomorphic encryption, achieving significant improvements in speed and communication efficiency while preserving data privacy.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) effectively
safeguards data privacy during model aggregation by encrypting local model
updates before transmission, mitigating threats from untrusted servers or
eavesdroppers in transmission. However, the computational burden and ciphertext
expansion associated with homomorphic encryption can significantly increase
resource and communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose
FedBit, a hardware/software co-designed framework optimized for the
Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) scheme. FedBit employs bit-interleaved data
packing to embed multiple model parameters into a single ciphertext
coefficient, thereby minimizing ciphertext expansion and maximizing
computational parallelism. Additionally, we integrate a dedicated FPGA
accelerator to handle cryptographic operations and an optimized dataflow to
reduce the memory overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that FedBit
achieves a speedup of two orders of magnitude in encryption and lowers average
communication overhead by 60.7%, while maintaining high accuracy.

### [1213] [StarveSpam: Mitigating Spam with Local Reputation in Permissionless Blockchains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23427)
*Rowdy Chotkan,Bulat Nasrulin,Jérémie Decouchant,Johan Pouwelse*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: StarveSpam is a decentralized, reputation-based protocol that mitigates blockchain spam by operating at the transaction relay layer, outperforming existing defenses in blocking spam and preserving legitimate traffic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spam defenses in blockchain networks rely heavily on economic deterrence, which fails to differentiate between malicious and legitimate users and excludes low-value but honest activity.

Method: StarveSpam utilizes decentralized local behavior tracking, peer scoring, and adaptive rate-limiting at the transaction relay layer without requiring global consensus, protocol changes, or centralized infrastructure.

Result: Evaluation on real Ethereum data during a major NFT spam event demonstrated StarveSpam's effectiveness, blocking over 95% of spam while preserving 97% of legitimate traffic, and reducing network exposure to spam by 85%.

Conclusion: StarveSpam offers a scalable and deployable solution for blockchain spam defenses, enhancing resilience and equity in blockchain infrastructure.

Abstract: Spam poses a growing threat to blockchain networks. Adversaries can easily
create multiple accounts to flood transaction pools, inflating fees and
degrading service quality. Existing defenses against spam, such as fee markets
and staking requirements, primarily rely on economic deterrence, which fails to
distinguish between malicious and legitimate users and often exclude low-value
but honest activity. To address these shortcomings, we present StarveSpam, a
decentralized reputation-based protocol that mitigates spam by operating at the
transaction relay layer. StarveSpam combines local behavior tracking, peer
scoring, and adaptive rate-limiting to suppress abusive actors, without
requiring global consensus, protocol changes, or trusted infrastructure. We
evaluate StarveSpam using real Ethereum data from a major NFT spam event and
show that it outperforms existing fee-based and rule-based defenses, allowing
each node to block over 95% of spam while dropping just 3% of honest traffic,
and reducing the fraction of the network exposed to spam by 85% compared to
existing rule-based methods. StarveSpam offers a scalable and deployable
alternative to traditional spam defenses, paving the way toward more resilient
and equitable blockchain infrastructure.

### [1214] [Multiple Concurrent Proposers: Why and How](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23984)
*Pranav Garimidi,Joachim Neu,Max Resnick*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multiple concurrent proposer (MCP) protocol to address miner extractable value (MEV) in blockchains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate MEV through enhancing underlying blockchain consensus protocol properties such as selective-censorship resistance and transaction hiding.

Method: Designing a MCP protocol that prevents adversaries from delaying transactions selectively or seeing their contents prematurely.

Result: The proposed MCP protocol ensures selective-censorship resistance and hiding properties.

Conclusion: MCP protocol advances blockchain consensus mechanisms facilitating secure and efficient on-chain auctions to reduce MEV exploitation.

Abstract: Traditional single-proposer blockchains suffer from miner extractable value
(MEV), where validators exploit their serial monopoly on transaction inclusion
and ordering to extract rents from users. While there have been many
developments at the application layer to reduce the impact of MEV, these
approaches largely require auctions as a subcomponent. Running auctions
efficiently on chain requires two key properties of the underlying consensus
protocol: selective-censorship resistance and hiding. These properties
guarantee that an adversary can neither selectively delay transactions nor see
their contents before they are confirmed. We propose a multiple concurrent
proposer (MCP) protocol offering exactly these properties.

*Yury Yanovich,Victoria Kovalevskaya,Maksim Egorov,Elizaveta Smirnova,Matvey Mishuris,Yash Madhwal,Kirill Ziborov,Vladimir Gorgadze,Subodh Sharma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BugMagnifier identifies vulnerabilities in TON smart contracts using systematic transaction simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of detecting temporal dependencies and race conditions in TON smart contracts caused by asynchronous execution.

Method: Developed a framework called BugMagnifier that uses controlled message orchestration, differential state analysis, and probabilistic permutation testing within TON Sandbox and TVM.

Result: Through experimental evaluation, BugMagnifier identified vulnerabilities in purpose-built smart contracts, demonstrating a detection complexity influenced by message ratios.

Conclusion: BugMagnifier automates vulnerability discovery, moves away from manual analysis, and supports safer smart contract development for asynchronous execution environments.

Abstract: The Open Network (TON) blockchain employs an asynchronous execution model
that introduces unique security challenges for smart contracts, particularly
race conditions arising from unpredictable message processing order. While
previous work established vulnerability patterns through static analysis of
audit reports, dynamic detection of temporal dependencies through systematic
testing remains an open problem. We present BugMagnifier, a transaction
simulation framework that systematically reveals vulnerabilities in TON smart
contracts through controlled message orchestration. Built atop TON Sandbox and
integrated with the TON Virtual Machine (TVM), our tool combines precise
message queue manipulation with differential state analysis and probabilistic
permutation testing to detect asynchronous execution flaws. Experimental
evaluation demonstrates BugMagnifier's effectiveness through extensive
parametric studies on purpose-built vulnerable contracts, revealing message
ratio-dependent detection complexity that aligns with theoretical predictions.
This quantitative model enables predictive vulnerability assessment while
shifting discovery from manual expert analysis to automated evidence
generation. By providing reproducible test scenarios for temporal
vulnerabilities, BugMagnifier addresses a critical gap in the TON security
tooling, offering practical support for safer smart contract development in
asynchronous blockchain environments.

### [1216] [Towards Context-aware Mobile Privacy Notice: Implementation of A Deployable Contextual Privacy Policies Generator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22900)
*Haochen Gong,Zhen Tao,Shidong Pan,Zhenchang Xing,Xiaoyu Sun*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces PrivScan, an Android SDK enabling real-time, deployable Contextual Privacy Policies (CPPs) to enhance mobile app users' understanding of data practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to simplify and improve users' understanding of privacy policies, which are typically lengthy and inaccessible, in the context of mobile apps.

Method: The proposed PrivScan SDK identifies graphical user interface (GUI) elements tied to personal data in live app screenshots and provides concise privacy policy snippets. It utilizes a modular architecture with components split between a remote backend and lightweight mobile client.

Result: PrivScan demonstrated practicality with an average execution time of 9.15 seconds and reduced on-device resource requirements while maintaining cross-platform portability.

Conclusion: PrivScan is a feasible approach to transform privacy policy understanding in mobile apps, offering an effective balance between usability, performance, and practicality. Its code and demo are publicly available for further exploration.

Abstract: Lengthy and legally phrased privacy policies impede users' understanding of
how mobile applications collect and process personal data. Prior work proposed
Contextual Privacy Policies (CPPs) for mobile apps to display shorter policy
snippets only in the corresponding user interface contexts, but the pipeline
could not be deployable in real-world mobile environments. In this paper, we
present PrivScan, the first deployable CPP Software Development Kit (SDK) for
Android. It captures live app screenshots to identify GUI elements associated
with types of personal data and displays CPPs in a concise, user-facing format.
We provide a lightweight floating button that offers low-friction, on-demand
control. The architecture leverages remote deployment to decouple the
multimodal backend pipeline from a mobile client comprising five modular
components, thereby reducing on-device resource demands and easing
cross-platform portability. A feasibility-oriented evaluation shows an average
execution time of 9.15\,s, demonstrating the practicality of our approach. The

### [1217] [A First Look at Privacy Risks of Android Task-executable Voice Assistant Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23680)
*Shidong Pan,Yikai Ge,Xiaoyu Sun*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper investigates privacy risks in Android task-executable voice assistants (VAs), uncovering inconsistencies and threat models across their privacy declarations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap in research on privacy risks in Android task-executable VAs from a task-execution pattern perspective.

Method: Analyzed ten popular VA applications, cross-referenced their privacy declarations across six sources, and identified patterns of inconsistencies and privacy threat models.

Result: Identified three major privacy threat models: (1) inadequate representation of mini apps within mega apps, (2) privilege escalation via inter-app interactions, and (3) abuse of Google system applications to evade permissions.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable recommendations for practitioners and highlights the broader relevance of these privacy risks to autonomous AI agents.

Abstract: With the development of foundation AI technologies, task-executable voice
assistants (VAs) have become more popular, enhancing user convenience and
expanding device functionality. Android task-executable VAs are applications
that are capable of understanding complex tasks and performing corresponding
operations. Given their prevalence and great autonomy, there is no existing
work examine the privacy risks within the voice assistants from the
task-execution pattern in a holistic manner. To fill this research gap, this
paper presents a user-centric comprehensive empirical study on privacy risks in
Android task-executable VA applications. We collect ten mainstream VAs as our
research target and analyze their operational characteristics. We then
cross-check their privacy declarations across six sources, including privacy
labels, policies, and manifest files, and our findings reveal widespread
inconsistencies. Moreover, we uncover three significant privacy threat models:
(1) privacy misdisclosure in mega apps, where integrated mini apps such as
Alexa skills are inadequately represented; (2) privilege escalation via
inter-application interactions, which exploit Android's communication
mechanisms to bypass user consent; and (3) abuse of Google system applications,
enabling apps to evade the declaration of dangerous permissions. Our study
contributes actionable recommendations for practitioners and underscores
broader relevance of these privacy risks to emerging autonomous AI agents.

### [1218] [When MCP Servers Attack: Taxonomy, Feasibility, and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24272)
*Weibo Zhao,Jiahao Liu,Bonan Ruan,Shaofei Li,Zhenkai Liang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores the security risks posed by MCP servers, which are interfaces connecting AI systems to external systems, by creating and testing malicious server implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the lack of standardized security protocols for MCP servers, creating opportunities for malicious exploitation in AI ecosystems.

Method: Researchers developed a taxonomy of attacks targeting MCP servers, implemented Proof-of-Concept malicious servers, and tested their impact across hosts and LLM environments.

Result: They found MCP servers are easy to weaponize, existing detection tools are ineffective, and attacks can severely compromise AI systems.

Conclusion: The paper suggests collaborative measures involving developers, designers, and users to strengthen MCP server security and resilience.

Abstract: Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers enable AI applications to connect to
external systems in a plug-and-play manner, but their rapid proliferation also
introduces severe security risks. Unlike mature software ecosystems with
rigorous vetting, MCP servers still lack standardized review mechanisms, giving
adversaries opportunities to distribute malicious implementations. Despite this
pressing risk, the security implications of MCP servers remain underexplored.
To address this gap, we present the first systematic study that treats MCP
servers as active threat actors and decomposes them into core components to
examine how adversarial developers can implant malicious intent. Specifically,
we investigate three research questions: (i) what types of attacks malicious
MCP servers can launch, (ii) how vulnerable MCP hosts and Large Language Models
(LLMs) are to these attacks, and (iii) how feasible it is to carry out MCP
server attacks in practice. Our study proposes a component-based taxonomy
comprising twelve attack categories. For each category, we develop
Proof-of-Concept (PoC) servers and demonstrate their effectiveness across
diverse real-world host-LLM settings. We further show that attackers can
generate large numbers of malicious servers at virtually no cost. We then test
state-of-the-art scanners on the generated servers and found that existing
detection approaches are insufficient. These findings highlight that malicious
MCP servers are easy to implement, difficult to detect with current tools, and
capable of causing concrete damage to AI agent systems. Addressing this threat
requires coordinated efforts among protocol designers, host developers, LLM
providers, and end users to build a more secure and resilient MCP ecosystem.

### [1219] [Bidirectional Intention Inference Enhances LLMs' Defense Against Multi-Turn Jailbreak Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22732)
*Haibo Tong,Dongcheng Zhao,Guobin Shen,Xiang He,Dachuan Lin,Feifei Zhao,Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses multi-turn jailbreak attacks on large language models (LLMs) by proposing a defense mechanism called Bidirectional Intention Inference Defense (BIID), significantly reducing attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing concerns over LLM safety, particularly jailbreak attacks that bypass alignment mechanisms, motivate the need for robust defenses against evolving multi-turn adversarial prompts.

Method: The Bidirectional Intention Inference Defense (BIID) combines forward intention inference and backward retrospection to detect concealed risks in user inputs and prevent harmful content generation.

Result: Experimental results show BIID significantly reduces attack success rates compared to existing defenses across multiple LLMs, benchmarks, and attack scenarios, while maintaining functionality.

Conclusion: The BIID method demonstrates substantial advantages in mitigating both single-turn and multi-turn jailbreak attacks and offers enhanced robustness over existing defense strategies.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised
significant safety concerns, particularly regarding "jailbreak" attacks that
exploit adversarial prompts to bypass safety alignment mechanisms. Existing
defense research primarily focuses on single-turn attacks, whereas multi-turn
jailbreak attacks progressively break through safeguards through by concealing
malicious intent and tactical manipulation, ultimately rendering conventional
single-turn defenses ineffective. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Bidirectional Intention Inference Defense (BIID). The method
integrates forward request-based intention inference with backward
response-based intention retrospection, establishing a bidirectional synergy
mechanism to detect risks concealed within seemingly benign inputs, thereby
constructing a more robust guardrails that effectively prevents harmful content
generation. The proposed method undergoes systematic evaluation compared with a
no-defense baseline and seven representative defense methods across three LLMs
and two safety benchmarks under 10 different attack methods. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the Attack
Success Rate (ASR) across both single-turn and multi-turn jailbreak attempts,
outperforming all existing baseline methods while effectively maintaining
practical utility. Notably, comparative experiments across three multi-turn
safety datasets further validate the proposed model's significant advantages
over other defense approaches.

### [1220] [Defending MoE LLMs against Harmful Fine-Tuning via Safety Routing Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22745)
*Jaehan Kim,Minkyoo Song,Seungwon Shin,Sooel Son*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper uncovers a vulnerability in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based large language models (LLMs) regarding routing drift after fine-tuning, making them susceptible to harmful fine-tuning (HFT) attacks. To address this, the authors propose SafeMoE, a method that mitigates routing drift and enhances the safety of MoE-based LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in current defenses for MoE LLMs and their vulnerability to harmful fine-tuning attacks caused by routing drift.

Method: The paper introduces SafeMoE, a fine-tuning approach that penalizes the difference in routing weights between the fine-tuned model and the initial safety-aligned model to reduce harmful routing drift.

Result: SafeMoE significantly reduces the harmfulness score (e.g., from 62.0 to 5.0 in OLMoE), maintains task utility within 1% degradation, and incurs only 2% computational overhead. It outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods across multiple MoE LLMs.

Conclusion: SafeMoE is proven to be an effective, scalable, and efficient solution for safeguarding MoE-based LLMs from routing drift vulnerabilities during fine-tuning, enhancing their practical safety.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have increasingly adopted the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for efficiency. MoE-based LLMs heavily
depend on a superficial safety mechanism in which harmful inputs are routed
safety-critical experts. However, our analysis reveals that routing decisions
for harmful inputs drift significantly after fine-tuning, exposing a critical
vulnerability to harmful fine-tuning (HFT) attacks. Existing defenses,
primarily designed for monolithic LLMs, are less effective for MoE LLMs as they
fail to prevent drift in harmful input routing. To address this limitation, we
propose SafeMoE, a safe fine-tuning method tailored to MoE LLMs. SafeMoE
directly mitigates routing drift by penalizing the gap between the routing
weights of a fine-tuned model and those of the initial safety-aligned model,
thereby preserving the safety-aligned routing of harmful inputs to
safety-critical experts. Experiments on open-source MoE LLMs ranging from 7B to
141B parameters demonstrate that SafeMoE effectively mitigates HFT attacks,
reducing the harmfulness score of OLMoE from 62.0 to 5.0, for example, while
maintaining task utility within 1% degradation and incurring only 2% overhead.
It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods for safeguarding
LLM fine-tuning and remains effective in recent large-scale MoE LLMs such as
gpt-oss and Llama 4. Our implementation is available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SafeMoE.

Result: The approach successfully demonstrated that AI could simulate adversarial attacks, uncover latent vulnerabilities, probe weaknesses in cryptographic implementations, and refine security measures effectively, highlighting novel attack vectors within AI-enhanced cryptographic processes.

Conclusion: A structured AI-driven methodology is effective for enhancing the security of quantum cryptographic protocols and can serve as a foundation for adopting AI in quantum network cybersecurity practices.

Abstract: This study presents a structured approach to evaluating vulnerabilities
within quantum cryptographic protocols, focusing on the BB84 quantum key
distribution method and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
approved quantum-resistant algorithms. By integrating AI-driven red teaming,
automated penetration testing, and real-time anomaly detection, the research
develops a framework for assessing and mitigating security risks in quantum
networks. The findings demonstrate that AI can be effectively used to simulate
adversarial attacks, probe weaknesses in cryptographic implementations, and
refine security mechanisms through iterative feedback. The use of automated
exploit simulations and protocol fuzzing provides a scalable means of
identifying latent vulnerabilities, while adversarial machine learning
techniques highlight novel attack surfaces within AI-enhanced cryptographic
processes. This study offers a comprehensive methodology for strengthening
quantum security and provides a foundation for integrating AI-driven
cybersecurity practices into the evolving quantum landscape.

### [1222] [Virus Infection Attack on LLMs: Your Poisoning Can Spread "VIA" Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23041)
*Zi Liang,Qingqing Ye,Xuan Liu,Yanyun Wang,Jianliang Xu,Haibo Hu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper investigates the security risks of using synthetic data in LLM training and introduces Virus Infection Attack (VIA), showing its ability to propagate poisoning through synthetic data effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While synthetic data improves the training and performance of large language models (LLMs), its potential vulnerability to security risks has not been thoroughly studied.

Method: The authors systematically evaluate the resistance of synthetic-data-integrated LLM training against known poisoning and backdoor attacks. They propose VIA, a universal attack framework that masks harmful payloads and optimizes their insertion into benign samples for efficient propagation.

Result: VIA is shown to substantially increase poisoning content in synthetic data, achieving attack success rates on downstream models comparable to those on poisoned upstream models.

Conclusion: Although synthetic data improves model robustness, this study highlights its security risks and demonstrates the vulnerability introduced by VIA, emphasizing the need for mitigations.

Abstract: Synthetic data refers to artificial samples generated by models. While it has
been validated to significantly enhance the performance of large language
models (LLMs) during training and has been widely adopted in LLM development,
potential security risks it may introduce remain uninvestigated. This paper
systematically evaluates the resilience of synthetic-data-integrated training
paradigm for LLMs against mainstream poisoning and backdoor attacks. We reveal
that such a paradigm exhibits strong resistance to existing attacks, primarily
thanks to the different distribution patterns between poisoning data and
queries used to generate synthetic samples. To enhance the effectiveness of
these attacks and further investigate the security risks introduced by
synthetic data, we introduce a novel and universal attack framework, namely,
Virus Infection Attack (VIA), which enables the propagation of current attacks
through synthetic data even under purely clean queries. Inspired by the
principles of virus design in cybersecurity, VIA conceals the poisoning payload
within a protective "shell" and strategically searches for optimal hijacking
points in benign samples to maximize the likelihood of generating malicious
content. Extensive experiments on both data poisoning and backdoor attacks show
that VIA significantly increases the presence of poisoning content in synthetic
data and correspondingly raises the attack success rate (ASR) on downstream
models to levels comparable to those observed in the poisoned upstream models.

### [1223] [LLM Watermark Evasion via Bias Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23019)
*Jeongyeon Hwang,Sangdon Park,Jungseul Ok*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study introduces Bias-Inversion Rewriting Attack (BIRA), an adversarial method to evade watermarking in large language models, achieving high success rates while maintaining semantic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze and expose the vulnerabilities of watermarking techniques in large language models, particularly under adversarial evasion attacks.

Method: The researchers designed a model-agnostic adversarial attack, BIRA, which suppresses the logits of likely watermarked tokens to weaken the watermark signal without prior knowledge of the watermarking scheme.

Result: BIRA achieved over 99% evasion of watermarks while preserving the original text's semantic content across various watermarking methods.

Conclusion: The paper highlights a systematic vulnerability in existing watermarking approaches and stresses the importance of rigorous stress testing and the development of more robust defenses against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Watermarking for large language models (LLMs) embeds a statistical signal
during generation to enable detection of model-produced text. While
watermarking has proven effective in benign settings, its robustness under
adversarial evasion remains contested. To advance a rigorous understanding and
evaluation of such vulnerabilities, we propose the \emph{Bias-Inversion
Rewriting Attack} (BIRA), which is theoretically motivated and model-agnostic.
BIRA weakens the watermark signal by suppressing the logits of likely
watermarked tokens during LLM-based rewriting, without any knowledge of the
underlying watermarking scheme. Across recent watermarking methods, BIRA
achieves over 99\% evasion while preserving the semantic content of the
original text. Beyond demonstrating an attack, our results reveal a systematic
vulnerability, emphasizing the need for stress testing and robust defenses.

### [1224] [MaskSQL: Safeguarding Privacy for LLM-Based Text-to-SQL via Abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23459)
*Sepideh Abedini,Shubhankar Mohapatra,D. B. Emerson,Masoumeh Shafieinejad,Jesse C. Cresswell,Xi He*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MaskSQL is a text-to-SQL framework designed to protect privacy while achieving high performance by masking sensitive information in LLM prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the limitations of deploying LLMs in privacy-sensitive applications, as LLMs require external data sharing and are resource-intensive. They target the problem of privacy protection for text-to-SQL tasks while maintaining high utility.

Method: MaskSQL introduces an abstraction-based privacy mechanism that retains critical information and discards unnecessary details in LLM prompts. This contrasts with redaction and generalization methods, providing a more nuanced privacy-utility tradeoff.

Result: The MaskSQL framework achieves superior performance over small language models (SLMs) and approaches the performance of advanced LLMs, while effectively preserving privacy.

Conclusion: MaskSQL presents a novel approach to balancing privacy and utility for text-to-SQL translation, offering a suitable solution for privacy-conscious applications with robust performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance on tasks that
require reasoning, such as text-to-SQL, code generation, and debugging.
However, regulatory frameworks with strict privacy requirements constrain their
integration into sensitive systems. State-of-the-art LLMs are also proprietary,
costly, and resource-intensive, making local deployment impractical.
Consequently, utilizing such LLMs often requires sharing data with third-party
providers, raising privacy concerns and risking noncompliance with regulations.
Although fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) can outperform LLMs on certain
tasks and be deployed locally to mitigate privacy concerns, they underperform
on more complex tasks such as text-to-SQL translation. In this work, we
introduce MaskSQL, a text-to-SQL framework that utilizes abstraction as a
privacy protection mechanism to mask sensitive information in LLM prompts.
Unlike redaction, which removes content entirely, or generalization, which
broadens tokens, abstraction retains essential information while discarding
unnecessary details, striking an effective privacy-utility balance for the
text-to-SQL task. Moreover, by providing mechanisms to control the
privacy-utility tradeoff, MaskSQL facilitates adoption across a broader range
of use cases. Our experimental results show that MaskSQL outperforms leading
SLM-based text-to-SQL models and achieves performance approaching
state-of-the-art LLM-based models, while preserving privacy.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReliabilityRAG, a framework for enhancing retrieval-augmented generation systems' resilience to adversarial attacks by leveraging reliability information of retrieved documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the vulnerability of RAG systems to adversarial attacks such as prompt injection, and the need for robust defenses while leveraging built-in signals like document ranking and inherent complexity in adversarial challenges.

Method: ReliabilityRAG uses a graph-theoretic approach to filter malicious documents via a Maximum Independent Set algorithm prioritizing higher-reliability documents, and introduces a scalable weighted framework for larger retrieval sets.

Result: ReliabilityRAG demonstrated improved robustness against attacks, sustained high accuracy, and outperformed other methods in long-form generation tasks.

Conclusion: The framework represents a significant advancement in protecting RAG systems from malicious document corruption, with provable robustness and potential scalability in real-world applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models by
grounding their outputs in external documents. These systems, however, remain
vulnerable to attacks on the retrieval corpus, such as prompt injection.
RAG-based search systems (e.g., Google's Search AI Overview) present an
interesting setting for studying and protecting against such threats, as
defense algorithms can benefit from built-in reliability signals -- like
document ranking -- and represent a non-LLM challenge for the adversary due to
decades of work to thwart SEO.
  Motivated by, but not limited to, this scenario, this work introduces
ReliabilityRAG, a framework for adversarial robustness that explicitly
leverages reliability information of retrieved documents.
  Our first contribution adopts a graph-theoretic perspective to identify a
"consistent majority" among retrieved documents to filter out malicious ones.
We introduce a novel algorithm based on finding a Maximum Independent Set (MIS)
on a document graph where edges encode contradiction. Our MIS variant
explicitly prioritizes higher-reliability documents and provides provable
robustness guarantees against bounded adversarial corruption under natural
assumptions. Recognizing the computational cost of exact MIS for large
retrieval sets, our second contribution is a scalable weighted sample and
aggregate framework. It explicitly utilizes reliability information, preserving
some robustness guarantees while efficiently handling many documents.
  We present empirical results showing ReliabilityRAG provides superior
robustness against adversarial attacks compared to prior methods, maintains
high benign accuracy, and excels in long-form generation tasks where prior
robustness-focused methods struggled. Our work is a significant step towards
more effective, provably robust defenses against retrieved corpus corruption in
RAG.

*Yuqiao Meng,Luoxi Tang,Feiyang Yu,Xi Li,Guanhua Yan,Ping Yang,Zhaohan Xi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CyberTeam, a benchmark framework to optimize the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for blue team threat-hunting practices in cybersecurity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the growing complexity of cyber threats and enhancing the effectiveness of LLMs in assisting blue team defenders in real-world threat-hunting scenarios.

Method: CyberTeam organizes threat-hunting workflows into two structured stages, linking analytical tasks across threat attribution and incident response. Tasks are modularized, creating a standardized sequence of reasoning steps.

Result: CyberTeam incorporates 30 tasks and 9 operational modules, helping guide LLMs in standardized threat analysis. Evaluation revealed improvements in performance and exposed the limitations of open-ended reasoning strategies.

Conclusion: Structured frameworks like CyberTeam improve LLM-driven threat analysis processes, emphasizing the utility of standardized workflows over open-ended approaches in cybersecurity applications.

Abstract: As cyber threats continue to grow in scale and sophistication, blue team
defenders increasingly require advanced tools to proactively detect and
mitigate risks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for
enhancing threat analysis. However, their effectiveness in real-world blue team
threat-hunting scenarios remains insufficiently explored. This paper presents
CyberTeam, a benchmark designed to guide LLMs in blue teaming practice.
CyberTeam constructs a standardized workflow in two stages. First, it models
realistic threat-hunting workflows by capturing the dependencies among
analytical tasks from threat attribution to incident response. Next, each task
is addressed through a set of operational modules tailored to its specific
analytical requirements. This transforms threat hunting into a structured
sequence of reasoning steps, with each step grounded in a discrete operation
and ordered according to task-specific dependencies. Guided by this framework,
LLMs are directed to perform threat-hunting tasks through modularized steps.
Overall, CyberTeam integrates 30 tasks and 9 operational modules to guide LLMs
through standardized threat analysis. We evaluate both leading LLMs and
state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents, comparing CyberTeam against open-ended
reasoning strategies. Our results highlight the improvements enabled by
standardized design, while also revealing the limitations of open-ended
reasoning in real-world threat hunting.

*Yuqiao Meng,Luoxi Tang,Feiyang Yu,Jinyuan Jia,Guanhua Yan,Ping Yang,Zhaohan Xi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper delves into existing vulnerabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tasks and proposes methodologies to enhance their reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have shown promise in assisting cybersecurity tasks such as threat analysis and intrusion defense, but significant gaps limit their practical application.

Method: The authors use benchmarks, real-world case studies, and a novel categorization methodology integrating stratification, autoregressive refinement, and human-in-the-loop supervision to analyze LLM performance.

Result: Three critical vulnerabilities are identified in LLMs for CTI tasks: spurious correlations, contradictory knowledge, and constrained generalization.

Conclusion: The paper recommends improvements to address these vulnerabilities and provides insights for further research on LLM applications in cybersecurity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are intensively used to assist security analysts
in counteracting the rapid exploitation of cyber threats, wherein LLMs offer
cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to support vulnerability assessment and
incident response. While recent work has shown that LLMs can support a wide
range of CTI tasks such as threat analysis, vulnerability detection, and
intrusion defense, significant performance gaps persist in practical
deployments. In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic vulnerabilities of
LLMs in CTI, focusing on challenges that arise from the nature of the threat
landscape itself rather than the model architecture. Using large-scale
evaluations across multiple CTI benchmarks and real-world threat reports, we
introduce a novel categorization methodology that integrates stratification,
autoregressive refinement, and human-in-the-loop supervision to reliably
analyze failure instances. Through extensive experiments and human inspections,
we reveal three fundamental vulnerabilities: spurious correlations,
contradictory knowledge, and constrained generalization, that limit LLMs in
effectively supporting CTI. Subsequently, we provide actionable insights for
designing more robust LLM-powered CTI systems to facilitate future research.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces DUALLM, a novel dual-method pipeline for classifying Linux kernel patches, achieving high accuracy in identifying security-critical vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The delayed adoption of security patches in the Linux kernel by downstream maintainers creates vulnerability windows in the software ecosystem.

Method: DUALLM integrates a large language model and a fine-tuned small model, analyzing commit titles/messages, diffs, and code context for patch classification.

Result: DUALLM achieved 87.4% accuracy, identified 111 vulnerability patches with 90 true positives verified manually, and produced proof-of-concepts for two critical bugs.

Conclusion: DUALLM significantly improves the identification of security-critical Linux kernel patches, providing a robust solution against silent and ambiguous bug fixes.

Abstract: Open-source software projects are foundational to modern software ecosystems,
with the Linux kernel standing out as a critical exemplar due to its ubiquity
and complexity. Although security patches are continuously integrated into the
Linux mainline kernel, downstream maintainers often delay their adoption,
creating windows of vulnerability. A key reason for this lag is the difficulty
in identifying security-critical patches, particularly those addressing
exploitable vulnerabilities such as out-of-bounds (OOB) accesses and
use-after-free (UAF) bugs. This challenge is exacerbated by intentionally
silent bug fixes, incomplete or missing CVE assignments, delays in CVE
issuance, and recent changes to the CVE assignment criteria for the Linux
kernel. While fine-grained patch classification approaches exist, they exhibit
limitations in both coverage and accuracy. In this work, we identify previously
unexplored opportunities to significantly improve fine-grained patch
classification. Specifically, by leveraging cues from commit titles/messages
and diffs alongside appropriate code context, we develop DUALLM, a dual-method
pipeline that integrates two approaches based on a Large Language Model (LLM)
and a fine-tuned small language model. DUALLM achieves 87.4% accuracy and an
F1-score of 0.875, significantly outperforming prior solutions. Notably, DUALLM
successfully identified 111 of 5,140 recent Linux kernel patches as addressing
OOB or UAF vulnerabilities, with 90 true positives confirmed by manual
verification (many do not have clear indications in patch descriptions).
Moreover, we constructed proof-of-concepts for two identified bugs (one UAF and
one OOB), including one developed to conduct a previously unknown control-flow
hijack as further evidence of the correctness of the classification.

*Yukun Chen,Boheng Li,Yu Yuan,Leyi Qi,Yiming Li,Tianwei Zhang,Zhan Qin,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Knowledge distillation (KD) can introduce backdoors dormant in teacher models that activate in student models; the SCAR method facilitates this attack efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover vulnerabilities in KD processes that could allow attackers to implement hidden backdoors in student models through teacher models.

Method: The attack is framed as a bilevel optimization using a surrogate student model during the KD process and implementing an implicit differentiation algorithm for optimization.

Result: SCAR demonstrates efficient injection of backdoors into teacher models that reliably activate in student models after the KD process, even under clean datasets, and evades existing detection methods.

Conclusion: SCAR exposes a critical weakness in KD workflows, emphasizing the need for enhanced security protocols to prevent backdoor vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a vital technique for deploying deep neural
networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained devices by transferring knowledge from
large teacher models to lightweight student models. While teacher models from
third-party platforms may undergo security verification (\eg, backdoor
detection), we uncover a novel and critical threat: distillation-conditional
backdoor attacks (DCBAs). DCBA injects dormant and undetectable backdoors into
teacher models, which become activated in student models via the KD process,
even with clean distillation datasets. While the direct extension of existing
methods is ineffective for DCBA, we implement this attack by formulating it as
a bilevel optimization problem and proposing a simple yet effective method
(\ie, SCAR). Specifically, the inner optimization simulates the KD process by
optimizing a surrogate student model, while the outer optimization leverages
outputs from this surrogate to optimize the teacher model for implanting the
conditional backdoor. Our SCAR addresses this complex optimization utilizing an
implicit differentiation algorithm with a pre-optimized trigger injection
function. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, model architectures,
and KD techniques validate the effectiveness of our SCAR and its resistance
against existing backdoor detection, highlighting a significant yet previously
overlooked vulnerability in the KD process. Our code is available at

DM security, and outline prospective research directions in this critical
field. This work aims to accelerate progress not only in the technical
capabilities of generative artificial intelligence but also in the maturity and
wisdom of its application.

*Yixu Wang,Yan Teng,Yingchun Wang,Xingjun Ma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LoRA-based fine-tuning for vision models is vulnerable to model extraction attacks, and the paper proposes an efficient new attack method called StolenLoRA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA compactness introduces safety concerns, particularly encouraging new types of model extraction attacks.

Method: The paper devises StolenLoRA, which utilizes synthetic data generation via Large Language Models and incorporates Disagreement-based Semi-supervised Learning (DSL) for effective extraction.

Result: StolenLoRA achieved up to a 96.60% attack success rate with just 10k queries, highlighting vulnerabilities even across different backbones.

Conclusion: LoRA-adapted models have unique vulnerabilities requiring urgent defense mechanisms, with diversified LoRA deployments explored as a potential strategy.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA have transformed
vision model adaptation, enabling the rapid deployment of customized models.
However, the compactness of LoRA adaptations introduces new safety concerns,
particularly their vulnerability to model extraction attacks. This paper
introduces a new focus of model extraction attacks named LoRA extraction that
extracts LoRA-adaptive models based on a public pre-trained model. We then
propose a novel extraction method called StolenLoRA which trains a substitute
model to extract the functionality of a LoRA-adapted model using synthetic
data. StolenLoRA leverages a Large Language Model to craft effective prompts
for data generation, and it incorporates a Disagreement-based Semi-supervised
Learning (DSL) strategy to maximize information gain from limited queries. Our
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of StolenLoRA, achieving up to a
96.60% attack success rate with only 10k queries, even in cross-backbone
scenarios where the attacker and victim models utilize different pre-trained
backbones. These findings reveal the specific vulnerability of LoRA-adapted
models to this type of extraction and underscore the urgent need for robust
defense mechanisms tailored to PEFT methods. We also explore a preliminary
defense strategy based on diversified LoRA deployments, highlighting its
potential to mitigate such attacks.

*Benedetta Tondi,Andrea Costanzo,Mauro Barni*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a watermarking method embedding textual descriptions into images using advanced techniques to achieve robustness and imperceptibility, capable of enduring diverse modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for embedding high-payload textual information into images in a robust and imperceptible manner, especially for understanding semantic changes in AI-generated images.

Method: The authors utilized traditional watermarking approaches enhanced with orthogonal and turbo codes, frequency-domain embedding, and perceptual masking to ensure robustness and imperceptibility of the embedded watermark.

Result: The method demonstrated strong resistance to various image processing techniques, including AI-generated alterations, successfully recovering the embedded text post-modifications.

Conclusion: This watermarking technique offers a robust solution for embedding and retrieving textual descriptions in images, providing a means to analyze semantic changes due to image-text mismatches.

Abstract: We propose a high-payload image watermarking method for textual embedding,
where a semantic description of the image - which may also correspond to the
input text prompt-, is embedded inside the image. In order to be able to
robustly embed high payloads in large-scale images - such as those produced by
modern AI generators - the proposed approach builds upon a traditional
watermarking scheme that exploits orthogonal and turbo codes for improved
robustness, and integrates frequency-domain embedding and perceptual masking
techniques to enhance watermark imperceptibility. Experiments show that the
proposed method is extremely robust against a wide variety of image processing,
and the embedded text can be retrieved also after traditional and AI
inpainting, permitting to unveil the semantic modification the image has
undergone via image-text mismatch analysis.

*Ke Wang,Felix Qu,Libin Xia,Zishuo Zhao,Chris Tong,Lynn Ai,Eric Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: VeriLLM is a protocol enabling secure, efficient, and publicly verifiable decentralized inference for large language models (LLMs), achieving negligible verification costs and incentivizing honest behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decentralized inference for LLMs offers benefits like security, efficiency, and cost savings but requires output verifiability due to lack of trust in permissionless nodes.

Method: The paper introduces VeriLLM, featuring a verification algorithm, peer-prediction mechanism for honest checking, and a network architecture that combines inference and verification roles on the same GPU workers.

Result: VeriLLM achieves 1% verification costs, increases throughput and GPU utilization, strengthens security, and enforces Nash equilibrium for rationally honest behavior.

Conclusion: VeriLLM is a pioneering protocol that offers decentralized LLM inference with game-theoretically proven security while optimizing efficiency and robustness of verification.

Abstract: Decentralized inference is an appealing paradigm for serving large language
models (LLMs), offering strong security, high efficiency, and lower operating
costs. Yet the permissionless setting admits no a priori trust in participating
nodes, making output verifiability a prerequisite for secure deployment. We
present VeriLLM, a publicly verifiable protocol for decentralized LLM inference
that (i) achieves security under a one-honest-verifier assumption, (ii) attains
near-negligible verification cost (about 1% of the underlying inference) via a
lightweight verification algorithm designed explicitly for LLMs, and (iii)
enforces honest checking through a peer-prediction mechanism that mitigates
lazy verification in naive voting. We further introduce an isomorphic
inference-verification network that multiplexes both roles on the same set of
GPU workers. This architecture (i) increases GPU utilization and thereby
improves end-to-end throughput for both inference and verification, (ii)
expands the effective pool of available validators, strengthening robustness
and security, and (iii) enforces task indistinguishability at the worker
boundary to prevent job-type-conditioned behavior. Finally, we provide a formal
game-theoretic analysis and prove that, under our incentives, honest inference
and verification constitute a Nash equilibrium, ensuring incentive
compatibility against rational adversaries. To our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized inference verification protocol with an end-to-end game-theoretic
security proof.

*Yuzhen Long,Songze Li*

TL;DR: The paper presents FuncPoison, a poisoning-based attack targeting the function library of LLM-driven multi-agent autonomous driving systems, causing cascading decision-making errors among agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the vulnerabilities within the function library of LLM-driven multi-agent autonomous driving systems, which have been under-explored despite their importance.

Method: Introduces FuncPoison attack that injects malicious tools with deceptive instructions to exploit weak points in agents' reliance on text-based instructions and standardized command formats.

Result: FuncPoison significantly degrades trajectory accuracy on tested systems, selectively targets specific agents, and evades various defense mechanisms.

Conclusion: The function library, often overlooked as a toolset, represents a critical attack surface in LLM-based autonomous systems, elevating concerns about their reliability.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems increasingly rely on multi-agent architectures
powered by large language models (LLMs), where specialized agents collaborate
to perceive, reason, and plan. A key component of these systems is the shared
function library, a collection of software tools that agents use to process
sensor data and navigate complex driving environments. Despite its critical
role in agent decision-making, the function library remains an under-explored
vulnerability. In this paper, we introduce FuncPoison, a novel poisoning-based
attack targeting the function library to manipulate the behavior of LLM-driven
multi-agent autonomous systems. FuncPoison exploits two key weaknesses in how
agents access the function library: (1) agents rely on text-based instructions
to select tools; and (2) these tools are activated using standardized command
formats that attackers can replicate. By injecting malicious tools with
deceptive instructions, FuncPoison manipulates one agent s decisions--such as
misinterpreting road conditions--triggering cascading errors that mislead other
agents in the system. We experimentally evaluate FuncPoison on two
representative multi-agent autonomous driving systems, demonstrating its
ability to significantly degrade trajectory accuracy, flexibly target specific
agents to induce coordinated misbehavior, and evade diverse defense mechanisms.
Our results reveal that the function library, often considered a simple
toolset, can serve as a critical attack surface in LLM-based autonomous driving
systems, raising elevated concerns on their reliability.

Result: Their solutions demonstrate progress towards applying privacy-preserving methods in large-scale machine learning applications, including LLMs, with practical examples like ethical usage enforcement and transformer inference.

Conclusion: The research shows promise for bridging the gap between overhead and practicality in privacy-preserving systems, enabling secure applications at scale.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving technologies have introduced a paradigm shift that allows
for realizable secure computing in real-world systems. The significant barrier
to the practical adoption of these primitives is the computational and
communication overhead that is incurred when applied at scale. In this paper,
we present an overview of our efforts to bridge the gap between this overhead
and practicality for privacy-preserving learning systems using multi-party
computation (MPC), zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), and fully homomorphic
encryption (FHE). Through meticulous hardware/software/algorithm co-design, we
show progress towards enabling LLM-scale applications in privacy-preserving
settings. We demonstrate the efficacy of our solutions in several contexts,
including DNN IP ownership, ethical LLM usage enforcement, and transformer
inference.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SecInfer is a defense method against prompt injection attacks for LLMs, using inference-time scaling and advanced response sampling and aggregation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt injection attacks undermine the security of LLMs, and existing prevention-based defenses show limited success against strong attacks.

Method: SecInfer employs inference-time scaling with system-prompt-guided sampling to generate diverse responses and target-task-guided aggregation to select the most effective response.

Result: Experiments demonstrate SecInfer's superiority in mitigating prompt injection attacks compared to state-of-the-art defenses and inference-time scaling methods.

Conclusion: Allocating more compute resources during inference enables SecInfer to robustly defend LLMs against prompt injection attacks, making it a promising security solution.

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a pervasive threat to the security of Large
Language Models (LLMs). State-of-the-art prevention-based defenses typically
rely on fine-tuning an LLM to enhance its security, but they achieve limited
effectiveness against strong attacks. In this work, we propose \emph{SecInfer},
a novel defense against prompt injection attacks built on \emph{inference-time
scaling}, an emerging paradigm that boosts LLM capability by allocating more
compute resources for reasoning during inference. SecInfer consists of two key
steps: \emph{system-prompt-guided sampling}, which generates multiple responses
for a given input by exploring diverse reasoning paths through a varied set of
system prompts, and \emph{target-task-guided aggregation}, which selects the
response most likely to accomplish the intended task. Extensive experiments
show that, by leveraging additional compute at inference, SecInfer effectively
mitigates both existing and adaptive prompt injection attacks, outperforming
state-of-the-art defenses as well as existing inference-time scaling
approaches.

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces two data-driven surrogate models to predict the viscoplastic response of HT-9 steel, a material relevant for nuclear energy applications, accelerating computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational expense of complex mechanistic microstructure-informed constitutive models, particularly for tasks requiring numerous evaluations such as optimization and uncertainty quantification.

Method: The authors developed and compared two local surrogate models: a piecewise response surface method and a mixture of experts model. These surrogates were trained on data from viscoplastic self-consistent (VPSC) simulations to predict the creep behavior of HT-9 steel.

Result: The mixture of experts model demonstrated superior accuracy compared to the piecewise response surface method in predicting the viscoplastic behavior of HT-9 steel.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of using data-driven surrogate models to replace computationally intensive constitutive models, with the mixture of experts model particularly excelling in predictive accuracy for complex material behaviors.

Abstract: Mechanistic microstructure-informed constitutive models for the mechanical
response of polycrystals are a cornerstone of computational materials science.
However, as these models become increasingly more complex - often involving
coupled differential equations describing the effect of specific deformation
modes - their associated computational costs can become prohibitive,
particularly in optimization or uncertainty quantification tasks that require
numerous model evaluations. To address this challenge, surrogate constitutive
models that balance accuracy and computational efficiency are highly desirable.
Data-driven surrogate models, that learn the constitutive relation directly
from data, have emerged as a promising solution. In this work, we develop two
local surrogate models for the viscoplastic response of a steel: a piecewise
response surface method and a mixture of experts model. These surrogates are
designed to adapt to complex material behavior, which may vary with material
parameters or operating conditions. The surrogate constitutive models are
applied to creep simulations of HT-9 steel, an alloy of considerable interest
to the nuclear energy sector due to its high tolerance to radiation damage,
using training data generated from viscoplastic self-consistent (VPSC)
simulations. We define a set of test metrics to numerically assess the accuracy
of our surrogate models for predicting viscoplastic material behavior, and show
that the mixture of experts model outperforms the piecewise response surface
method in terms of accuracy.

Motivation: The paper aims to improve scientific document understanding and citation modeling by introducing a benchmark shared task.

Method: Three subtasks (Citation Discovery, Masked Citation Prediction, and Citation Sentence Prediction) are proposed using a dataset of 60,000 annotated paragraphs from S2ORC, along with a test set and performance evaluation metrics.

Result: Seven teams participated, with three submitting results; performance across subtasks was reported and analyzed.

Conclusion: The shared task establishes a benchmark for citation modeling and provides publicly available resources to foster future research in the field.

Abstract: We present an overview of the SCIDOCA 2025 Shared Task, which focuses on
citation discovery and prediction in scientific documents. The task is divided
into three subtasks: (1) Citation Discovery, where systems must identify
relevant references for a given paragraph; (2) Masked Citation Prediction,
which requires selecting the correct citation for masked citation slots; and
(3) Citation Sentence Prediction, where systems must determine the correct
reference for each cited sentence. We release a large-scale dataset constructed
from the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus (S2ORC), containing over 60,000
annotated paragraphs and a curated reference set. The test set consists of
1,000 paragraphs from distinct papers, each annotated with ground-truth
citations and distractor candidates. A total of seven teams registered, with
three submitting results. We report performance metrics across all subtasks and
analyze the effectiveness of submitted systems. This shared task provides a new

TL;DR: The paper introduces novel methods for parameter estimation and inference in data with blockwise, non-monotone missingness using AI-powered models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop methods to address challenges posed by non-monotone missing data using AI models, ensuring both unbiasedness and efficiency in estimation.

Method: Utilizes semiparametric theory and introduces IBM(RAY) estimators leveraging AI models, Restricted Anova hierarchY approximation, and constrained quadratic programming for adaptive estimation.

Result: IBM estimators are unbiased, achieve efficiency gains, and perform well in simulations and real-world applications like surface protein abundance estimation.

Conclusion: These methods offer robust tools for handling missing data scenarios, blending AI with advanced statistical techniques for efficient estimation.

Abstract: We consider parameter estimation and inference when data feature blockwise,
non-monotone missingness. Our approach, rooted in semiparametric theory and
inspired by prediction-powered inference, leverages off-the-shelf AI
(predictive or generative) models to handle missing completely at random
mechanisms, by finding an approximation of the optimal estimating equation
through a novel and tractable Restricted Anova hierarchY (RAY) approximation.
The resulting Inference for Blockwise Missingness(RAY), or IBM(RAY) estimator
incorporates pre-trained AI models and carefully controls asymptotic variance
by tuning model-specific hyperparameters. We then extend IBM(RAY) to a general
class of estimators. We find the most efficient estimator in this class, which
we call IBM(Adaptive), by solving a constrained quadratic programming problem.
All IBM estimators are unbiased, and, crucially, asymptotically achieving
guaranteed efficiency gains over a naive complete-case estimator, regardless of
the predictive accuracy of the AI models used. We demonstrate the finite-sample
performance and numerical stability of our method through simulation studies
and an application to surface protein abundance estimation.

### [1240] [A Greedy PDE Router for Blending Neural Operators and Classical Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24814)
*Sahana Rayan,Yash Patel,Ambuj Tewari*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper proposes an approximate greedy router for hybrid iterative solvers to address limitations in computational cost and spectral bias when solving PDEs. It outperforms traditional methods and achieves faster, stable convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical numerical solvers are computationally expensive, and machine learning-based solvers struggle with spectral bias, leading to poor handling of high-frequency components in PDEs. Combining solvers effectively remains a difficult combinatorial problem.

Method: The authors propose an approximate greedy router that mimics greedy selection for solver choice in a hybrid iterative framework, addressing the lack of true error knowledge during selection.

Result: Empirical tests on Poisson and Helmholtz equations show the proposed method surpasses single-solver baselines and existing hybrid solvers like HINTS, ensuring quicker and more consistent convergence.

Conclusion: The method successfully leverages an approximation of greedy strategies to improve efficiency and reliability in solving PDEs, demonstrating significant advantages over conventional approaches.

Abstract: When solving PDEs, classical numerical solvers are often computationally
expensive, while machine learning methods can suffer from spectral bias,
failing to capture high-frequency components. Designing an optimal hybrid
iterative solver--where, at each iteration, a solver is selected from an
ensemble of solvers to leverage their complementary strengths--poses a
challenging combinatorial problem. While the greedy selection strategy is
desirable for its constant-factor approximation guarantee to the optimal
solution, it requires knowledge of the true error at each step, which is
generally unavailable in practice. We address this by proposing an approximate
greedy router that efficiently mimics a greedy approach to solver selection.
Empirical results on the Poisson and Helmholtz equations demonstrate that our
method outperforms single-solver baselines and existing hybrid solver
approaches, such as HINTS, achieving faster and more stable convergence.

*Yeo Jin Jung,Yating Liu,Zixuan Wu,So Won Jeong,Claire Donnat*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper proposes a computationally efficient algorithm for regularized RKHS conformal prediction, improving interval length by 30% and achieving a 40-fold speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to reduce computational costs in RKHS-based conditional conformal prediction intervals while maintaining theoretical robustness.

Method: The paper develops a path-tracing algorithm for the regularized RKHS conformal optimization, incorporates hyperparameter tuning, and introduces low-rank latent embeddings for high-dimensional scenarios.

Result: The proposed algorithm provides reliable conditional coverage, decreases interval length by 30%, and delivers significant speed improvements (40x compared to Gibbs et al., 2023).

Conclusion: The paper successfully bridges the computational gap in RKHS-based conformal prediction, offering practical gains in interval efficiency and scalability for modern predictors.

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides distribution-free prediction sets with
finite-sample conditional guarantees. We build upon the RKHS-based framework of
Gibbs et al. (2023), which leverages families of covariate shifts to provide
approximate conditional conformal prediction intervals, an approach with strong
theoretical promise, but with prohibitive computational cost. To bridge this
gap, we develop a stable and efficient algorithm that computes the full
solution path of the regularized RKHS conformal optimization problem, at
essentially the same cost as a single kernel quantile fit. Our path-tracing
framework simultaneously tunes hyperparameters, providing smoothness control
and data-adaptive calibration. To extend the method to high-dimensional
settings, we further integrate our approach with low-rank latent embeddings
that capture conditional validity in a data-driven latent space. Empirically,
our method provides reliable conditional coverage across a variety of modern
black-box predictors, improving the interval length of Gibbs et al. (2023) by
30%, while achieving a 40-fold speedup.

### [1242] [Surjective Independence of Causal Influences for Local Bayesian Network Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24759)
*Kieran Drury,Martine J. Barons,Jim Q. Smith*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: Bayesian networks can be complex and require many expert judgments, so the paper proposes a more efficient parameterization method called SICI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient Bayesian network parameterization due to cognitive burden and excessive judgments required for full probability modeling in complex domains.

Method: Introduce the surjective independence of causal influences (SICI) model as an alternative to the restrictive independence of causal influences (ICI) model.

Result: The SICI model relaxes the ICI assumption and simplifies the parameterization of Bayesian networks.

Conclusion: The SICI model provides a more practical approach to handle large and complex relationships in Bayesian networks while mitigating expert judgment challenges.

Abstract: The very expressiveness of Bayesian networks can introduce fresh challenges
due to the large number of relationships they often model. In many domains, it
is thus often essential to supplement any available data with elicited expert
judgements. This in turn leads to two key challenges: the cognitive burden of
these judgements is often very high, and there are a very large number of
judgements required to obtain a full probability model. We can mitigate both
issues by introducing assumptions such as independence of causal influences
(ICI) on the local structures throughout the network, restricting the parameter
space of the model. However, the assumption of ICI is often unjustified and
overly strong. In this paper, we introduce the surjective independence of
causal influences (SICI) model which relaxes the ICI assumption and provides a
more viable, practical alternative local structure model that facilitates
efficient Bayesian network parameterisation.

### [1243] [A Data-Driven Framework for Digital Transformation in Smart Cities: Integrating AI, Dashboards, and IoT Readiness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22721)
*Ángel Lloret,Jesús Peral,Antonio Ferrández,María Auladell,Rafael Muñoz*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automated approach to evaluating digital transformation (DT) levels in public sector organizations using AI methods, validated in local administrations in Spain and scalable for international contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is driven by the increasing demand for efficient, citizen-focused public services aligned with ESG criteria and global initiatives like the UN SDGs.

Method: The methodology integrates surveys conducted with public administrators and AI techniques like neural networks and transformer architectures to combine manual and automated DT assessments.

Result: The proposed method was effectively tested on local administrations in Spain and demonstrated strong performance in assessing their level of digital transformation.

Conclusion: The approach is adaptable for international scalability but acknowledges factors like local regulations and DT maturity influencing broader applicability. It also highlights the role of AI and IoT in fostering sustainable Smart Cities.

Abstract: Digital transformation (DT) has become a strategic priority for public
administrations, particularly due to the need to deliver more efficient and
citizen-centered services and respond to societal expectations, ESG
(Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria, and the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). In this context, the main objective of
this study is to propose an innovative methodology to automatically evaluate
the level of digital transformation (DT) in public sector organizations. The
proposed approach combines traditional assessment methods with Artificial
Intelligence (AI) techniques. The methodology follows a dual approach: on the
one hand, surveys are conducted using specialized staff from various public
entities; on the other, AI-based models (including neural networks and
transformer architectures) are used to estimate the DT level of the
organizations automatically. Our approach has been applied to a real-world case
study involving local public administrations in the Valencian Community (Spain)
and shown effective performance in assessing DT. While the proposed methodology
has been validated in a specific local context, its modular structure and
dual-source data foundation support its international scalability,
acknowledging that administrative, regulatory, and DT maturity factors may
condition its broader applicability. The experiments carried out in this work
include (i) the creation of a domain-specific corpus derived from the surveys
and websites of several organizations, used to train the proposed models; (ii)
the use and comparison of diverse AI methods; and (iii) the validation of our
approach using real data. The integration of technologies such as the IoT,
sensor networks, and AI-based analytics can significantly support resilient,
agile urban environments and the transition towards more effective and
sustainable Smart City models.

### [1244] [A Meta-Analysis of LLM Effects on Students across Qualification, Socialisation, and Subjectification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22725)
*Jiayu Huang,Ruoxin Ritter Wang,Jen-Hao Liu,Boming Xia,Yue Huang,Ruoxi Sun,Jason,Xue,Jinan Zou*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper examines the role of large language models (LLMs) in education through the lens of Biesta's framework, showing positive but uneven impacts across qualification, socialization, and subjectification in learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the broader educational implications of LLMs, moving beyond narrow performance metrics, and explore their impact within a philosophical framework of good education.

Method: Meta-analysis of 133 experimental and quasi-experimental studies (k = 188), using Biesta's qualification, socialization, and subjectification framework to assess impact.

Result: LLMs show positive impact on qualification, some variable effects in socialization, and limited effectiveness in fostering learner autonomy and development (subjectification), with sustained and reflective interventions yielding the most benefit.

Conclusion: LLMs hold potential for education but design choices critically shape their outcomes. Without intentional scaffolding for participation and agency, LLMs risk prioritizing measurable outcomes over broader educational goals, impacting the futures they enable.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly positioned as solutions for
education, yet evaluations often reduce their impact to narrow performance
metrics. This paper reframes the question by asking "what kind of impact should
LLMs have in education?" Drawing on Biesta's tripartite account of good
education: qualification, socialisation, and subjectification, we present a
meta-analysis of 133 experimental and quasi-experimental studies (k = 188).
Overall, the impact of LLMs on student learning is positive but uneven. Strong
effects emerge in qualification, particularly when LLMs function as tutors in
sustained interventions. Socialisation outcomes appear more variable,
concentrated in sustained, reflective interventions. Subjectification, linked
to autonomy and learner development, remains fragile, with improvements
confined to small-scale, long-term studies. This purpose-level view highlights
design as the decisive factor: without scaffolds for participation and agency,
LLMs privilege what is easiest to measure while neglecting broader aims of
education. For HCI and education, the issue is not just whether LLMs work, but
what futures they enable or foreclose.

TL;DR: The paper investigates AI-based feedback in engineering Capstone reports, observing initial adoption challenges but finding value for users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the quality and completeness of students' biweekly reports in an engineering Capstone program using AI feedback.

Method: Development and implementation of an LLM-powered tool to provide personalized feedback on draft reports. Analysis conducted over two rounds with engagement data.

Result: Findings show low initial adoption but significant improvements in report quality and completeness among users. The tool also identified organizational tasks for students.

Conclusion: AI tools can provide meaningful feedback and insights despite initial skepticism. Their potential in educational contexts warrants further exploration.

Abstract: This paper explores the development and adoption of AI-based formative
feedback in the context of biweekly reports in an engineering Capstone program.
Each student is required to write a short report detailing their individual
accomplishments over the past two weeks, which is then assessed by their
advising professor. An LLM-powered tool was developed to provide students with
personalized feedback on their draft reports, guiding them toward improved
completeness and quality. Usage data across two rounds revealed an initial
barrier to adoption, with low engagement rates. However, students who engaged
in the AI feedback system demonstrated the ability to use it effectively,
leading to improvements in the completeness and quality of their reports.
Furthermore, the tool's task-parsing capabilities provided a novel approach to
identify potential student organizational tasks and deliverables. The findings
suggest initial skepticism toward the tool with a limited adoption within the
studied context, however, they also highlight the potential for AI-driven tools
to provide students and professors valuable insights and formative support.

### [1246] [Regulating the Agency of LLM-based Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22735)
*Seán Boddy,Joshua Joseph*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to measure and control the agency of large language model-based agents to mitigate risks from misalignment and loss of control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasingly capable LLM-based agents pose higher risks due to misalignment and loss of control, necessitating methods to mitigate these potential harms.

Method: The authors define agency as a property separate from intelligence and measure it across three dimensions: preference rigidity, independent operation, and goal persistence. A representation engineering technique is used for controlling agency.

Result: The paper proposes tools for regulating LLM-based agents, including testing protocols, domain-specific agency limits, insurance frameworks, and agency ceilings.

Conclusion: The approach balances the need to mitigate risks while leveraging the benefits of controlled agentic behavior in AI systems.

Abstract: As increasingly capable large language model (LLM)-based agents are
developed, the potential harms caused by misalignment and loss of control grow
correspondingly severe. To address these risks, we propose an approach that
directly measures and controls the agency of these AI systems. We conceptualize
the agency of LLM-based agents as a property independent of
intelligence-related measures and consistent with the interdisciplinary
literature on the concept of agency. We offer (1) agency as a system property
operationalized along the dimensions of preference rigidity, independent
operation, and goal persistence, (2) a representation engineering approach to
the measurement and control of the agency of an LLM-based agent, and (3)
regulatory tools enabled by this approach: mandated testing protocols,
domain-specific agency limits, insurance frameworks that price risk based on
agency, and agency ceilings to prevent societal-scale risks. We view our
approach as a step toward reducing the risks that motivate the ``Scientist AI''
paradigm, while still capturing some of the benefits from limited agentic
behavior.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework called Societal Capacity Assessment Framework (SCAF) to evaluate societal factors that contribute to resilience and vulnerability in response to AI-related risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the "context gap" in AI risk evaluation by providing a method to assess societal readiness and vulnerability to risks associated with advanced AI deployment.

Method: The authors adapt methods from resilience analysis to create the SCAF, which uses indicators to measure societal resilience, coping, and adaptive capacities at the country level.

Result: SCAF offers insights to organizations on managing AI risks by incorporating societal-level context into their evaluations, and helps identify ways to improve societal preparedness.

Conclusion: By integrating societal conditions into AI risk assessments, the framework improves governance and enables more comprehensive risk management as AI systems expand globally.

Abstract: Risk assessments for advanced AI systems require evaluating both the models
themselves and their deployment contexts. We introduce the Societal Capacity
Assessment Framework (SCAF), an indicators-based approach to measuring a
society's vulnerability, coping capacity, and adaptive capacity in response to
AI-related risks. SCAF adapts established resilience analysis methodologies to
AI, enabling organisations to ground risk management in insights about
country-level deployment conditions. It can also support stakeholders in
identifying opportunities to strengthen societal preparedness for emerging AI
capabilities. By bridging disparate literatures and the "context gap" in AI
evaluation, SCAF promotes more holistic risk assessment and governance as
advanced AI systems proliferate globally.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a taxonomy to clarify discussions on AI's impact on higher education and reform curricula to address the disruptive yet enabling potential of AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of a shared framework to discuss AI's transformative impact on higher education, particularly within the mission of knowledge.

Method: The authors developed a taxonomy categorizing AI education narratives and emphasized curricular reform driven by pedagogy, expertise integration, and faculty journeys.

Result: AI education reframing through structured faculty journeys offers actionable strategies for advancing disciplinary expertise and curricula despite challenges.

Conclusion: Curricular reform aligned with the mission of knowledge is key to leveraging AI's pressures into opportunities for advancing inquiry and serving societal needs.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping higher education, yet current
debates often feel tangled, mixing concerns about pedagogy, operations,
curriculum, and the future of work without a shared framework. This paper
offers a first attempt at a taxonomy to organize the diverse narratives of AI
education and to inform discipline-based curricular discussions. We place these
narratives within the enduring responsibility of higher education: the mission
of knowledge. This mission includes not only the preservation and advancement
of disciplinary expertise, but also the cultivation of skills and wisdom, i.e.,
forms of meta-knowledge that encompass judgment, ethics, and social
responsibility. For the purpose of this paper's discussion, AI is defined as
adaptive, data-driven systems that automate analysis, modeling, and
decision-making, highlighting its dual role as enabler and disruptor across
disciplines. We argue that the most consequential challenges lie at the level
of curriculum and disciplinary purpose, where AI accelerates inquiry but also
unsettles expertise and identity. We show how disciplines evolve through the
interplay of research, curriculum, pedagogy, and faculty expertise, and why
curricular reform is the central lever for meaningful change. Pedagogical
innovation offers a strategic and accessible entry point, providing actionable
steps that help faculty and students build the expertise needed to engage in
deeper curricular rethinking and disciplinary renewal. Within this framing, we
suggest that meaningful reform can move forward through structured faculty
journeys: from AI literacy to pedagogy, curriculum design, and research
integration. The key is to align these journeys with the mission of knowledge,
turning the disruptive pressures of AI into opportunities for disciplines to
sustain expertise, advance inquiry, and serve society.

*Tobias Holtdirk,Dennis Assenmacher,Arnim Bleier,Claudia Wagner*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper studies fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for imputing survey responses, demonstrating their effectiveness in handling biased and missing data compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Survey researchers face challenges like rising costs and missing data, which affect inference and encourage the use of convenience samples. The paper seeks solutions using fine-tuned LLMs.

Method: The authors fine-tune LLMs on partial survey data to impute self-reported vote choices under different missing data scenarios. They compare fine-tuning, zero-shot prompting, and tabular classifiers.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs perform as well as tabular classifiers when missing data is random and outperform other methods when only biased convenience samples are available.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned LLMs provide an effective and practical approach to handling systematic missingness and biased samples, benefiting survey researchers and improving potential survey designs.

Abstract: Survey researchers face two key challenges: the rising costs of probability
samples and missing data (e.g., non-response or attrition), which can undermine
inference and increase the use of convenience samples. Recent work explores
using large language models (LLMs) to simulate respondents via persona-based
prompts, often without labeled data. We study a more practical setting where
partial survey responses exist: we fine-tune LLMs on available data to impute
self-reported vote choice under both random and systematic nonresponse, using
the German Longitudinal Election Study. We compare zero-shot prompting and
supervised fine-tuning against tabular classifiers (e.g., CatBoost) and test
how different convenience samples (e.g., students) used for fine-tuning affect
generalization.
  Our results show that when data are missing completely at random, fine-tuned
LLMs match tabular classifiers but outperform zero-shot approaches. When only
biased convenience samples are available, fine-tuning small (3B to 8B)
open-source LLMs can recover both individual-level predictions and
population-level distributions more accurately than zero-shot and often better
than tabular methods. This suggests fine-tuned LLMs offer a promising strategy
for researchers working with non-probability samples or systematic missingness,
and may enable new survey designs requiring only easily accessible
subpopulations.

Motivation: The researchers aim to understand the potential and constraints of LLMs in advanced computer science problems, particularly in multilingual and theoretical contexts, given their growing impact on CS education.

Method: A bilingual multimodal dataset of multiple-choice questions from high-level CS competitions was created, systematically evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on theoretical programming tasks in both English and Romanian.

Result: The evaluation revealed the capabilities and limitations of current LLMs, including how language choice affects their performance. Insights on their applicability to CS education and competition, as well as ethical considerations, were discussed.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for informed educational policies and practices regarding LLM use, offering a publicly available dataset and a self-assessment tool for Romanian students to foster further research and ethical integration in education.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed various
domains, particularly computer science (CS) education. These models exhibit
remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks and problem-solving, raising
questions about their potential and limitations in advanced CS contexts. This
study presents a novel bilingual (English-Romanian) multimodal (text and image)
dataset of multiple-choice questions derived from a high-level computer science
competition. A particularity of our dataset is that the problems are conceived
such that some of them are easier solved using reasoning on paper, while for
others writing code is more efficient. We systematically evaluate State of The
Art LLMs on this dataset, analyzing their performance on theoretical
programming tasks. Our findings reveal the strengths and limitations of current
LLMs, including the influence of language choice (English vs. Romanian),
providing insights into their applicability in CS education and competition
settings. We also address critical ethical considerations surrounding
educational integrity and the fairness of assessments in the context of LLM
usage. These discussions aim to inform future educational practices and
policies. To support further research, our dataset will be made publicly
available in both English and Romanian. Additionally, we release an educational
application tailored for Romanian students, enabling them to self-assess using
the dataset in an interactive and practice-oriented environment.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper critiques OpenAI's safety framework, revealing gaps in how it evaluates and addresses AI risks, and suggests stronger governance measures are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of voluntary safety governance frameworks by analyzing their practical application to risk mitigation in AI.

Method: Utilized affordance theory and the Mechanisms & Conditions model to analyze OpenAI's 'Preparedness Framework Version 2,' in conjunction with the MIT AI Risk Repository.

Result: Found that the framework evaluates only a small fraction of AI risks, allows deployment of potentially harmful AI systems, and centralizes decision-making power in OpenAI's CEO.

Conclusion: The study indicates that industry self-regulation is inadequate for managing serious AI risks and calls for more robust external governance interventions.

Abstract: Prominent AI companies are producing 'safety frameworks' as a type of
voluntary self-governance. These statements purport to establish risk
thresholds and safety procedures for the development and deployment of highly
capable AI. Understanding which AI risks are covered and what actions are
allowed, refused, demanded, encouraged, or discouraged by these statements is
vital for assessing how these frameworks actually govern AI development and
deployment. We draw on affordance theory to analyse the OpenAI 'Preparedness
Framework Version 2' (April 2025) using the Mechanisms & Conditions model of
affordances and the MIT AI Risk Repository. We find that this safety policy
requests evaluation of a small minority of AI risks, encourages deployment of
systems with 'Medium' capabilities for what OpenAI itself defines as 'severe
harm' (potential for >1000 deaths or >$100B in damages), and allows OpenAI's
CEO to deploy even more dangerous capabilities. These findings suggest that
effective mitigation of AI risks requires more robust governance interventions
beyond current industry self-regulation. Our affordance analysis provides a
replicable method for evaluating what safety frameworks actually permit versus
what they claim.

*Hai Siong Tan*

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)-based framework for predicting cosmological parameters and uncertainty estimation, applied to recent supernovae and BAO datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in predicting cosmological parameters with reliable uncertainty estimation using modern datasets while reconciling differences (e.g., Hubble tension) between various cosmological models.

Method: The authors developed a hybrid model combining Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Evidential Deep Learning, Bayesian Neural Networks, and Gaussian Processes to estimate posterior distributions of cosmological PDE parameters. The model was trained with gradient descent on Pantheon+ supernovae and BAO datasets.

Result: The proposed approach produced posterior distributions that were generally consistent between datasets, with $h_0$ estimates within about 2σ of each other, providing an alternate perspective on the Hubble tension.

Conclusion: The machine-learning framework enables consistent and reliable inference of cosmological parameters and offers a novel method for assessing the compatibility of datasets and models, contributing new insights to longstanding cosmological debates.

Abstract: We examine the use of a novel variant of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to
predict cosmological parameters from recent supernovae and baryon acoustic
oscillations (BAO) datasets. Our machine learning framework generates
uncertainty estimates for target variables and the inferred unknown parameters
of the underlying PDE descriptions. Built upon a hybrid of the principles of
Evidential Deep Learning, Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Bayesian Neural
Networks and Gaussian Processes, our model enables learning of the posterior
distribution of the unknown PDE parameters through standard gradient-descent
based training. We apply our model to an up-to-date BAO dataset (Bousis et al.
2024) calibrated with the CMB-inferred sound horizon, and the Pantheon$+$ Sne
Ia distances (Scolnic et al. 2018), examining the relative effectiveness and
mutual consistency among the standard $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM and $\Lambda_s$CDM
models. Unlike previous results arising from the standard approach of
minimizing an appropriate $\chi^2$ function, the posterior distributions for
parameters in various models trained purely on Pantheon$+$ data were found to
be largely contained within the $2\sigma$ contours of their counterparts
trained on BAO data. Their posterior medians for $h_0$ were within about
$2\sigma$ of one another, indicating that our machine learning-guided approach
provides a different measure of the Hubble tension.

TL;DR: The paper explores how large language models (LLMs) enhance single-cell RNA sequencing analysis by embedding gene information for better cell subtype classification and biological insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of analyzing rare cell subtypes in single-cell transcriptomic data and to leverage LLMs for more informed biological analysis.

Method: A framework integrates LLM-derived embeddings (e.g., from text-embedding-ada-002, BioBERT, SciBERT) with scRNA-seq by mapping expressed genes to NCBI Gene descriptions and applying LLMs for embedding.

Result: The approach improves retinal ganglion cell subtype classification, reveals biologically significant features, and provides insights into pathways involved in neuronal vulnerability, particularly in glaucoma contexts.

Conclusion: LLM-derived embeddings can significantly enhance biological analysis in data-limited settings, showcasing their potential in single-cell biology and opening the door for future foundation models in this domain.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong ability in generating rich
representations across domains such as natural language processing and
generation, computer vision, and multimodal learning. However, their
application in biomedical data analysis remains nascent. Single-cell
transcriptomic profiling is essential for dissecting cell subtype diversity in
development and disease, but rare subtypes pose challenges for scaling laws. We
present a computational framework that integrates single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA-seq) with LLMs to derive knowledge-informed gene embeddings. Highly
expressed genes for each cell are mapped to NCBI Gene descriptions and embedded
using models such as text-embedding-ada-002, BioBERT, and SciBERT. Applied to
retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which differ in vulnerability to
glaucoma-related neurodegeneration, this strategy improves subtype
classification, highlights biologically significant features, and reveals
pathways underlying selective neuronal vulnerability. More broadly, it
illustrates how LLM-derived embeddings can augment biological analysis under
data-limited conditions and lay the groundwork for future foundation models in
single-cell biology.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper investigates the role of interpretability techniques in understanding how deep learning models estimate galaxy stellar mass using multi-band images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end deep learning models excel in estimating galaxy properties without spectroscopy, but lack interpretability, making it unclear how non-integrated photometric information, such as morphology, contributes to these estimates.

Method: The authors use two interpretability techniques: causal analysis to uncover causal paths between variables, and mutual information decomposition to quantify contributions of input data (redundant, unique, synergistic) to stellar mass estimation. Data from SDSS and WISE is used.

Result: The study successfully provides physical interpretations of how image-based models function by revealing causal relationships and data component contributions to stellar mass estimation.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the value of blending deep learning with interpretability techniques, offering insights for astrophysical parameter estimation and advancing data-driven research on complex physical processes.

Abstract: End-to-end deep learning models fed with multi-band galaxy images are
powerful data-driven tools used to estimate galaxy physical properties in the
absence of spectroscopy. However, due to a lack of interpretability and the
associational nature of such models, it is difficult to understand how the
information additional to integrated photometry (e.g., morphology) contributes
to the estimation task. Improving our understanding in this field would enable
further advances into unraveling the physical connections among galaxy
properties and optimizing data exploitation. Therefore, our work is aimed at
interpreting the deep learning-based estimation of stellar mass via two
interpretability techniques: causal analysis and mutual information
decomposition. The former reveals the causal paths between multiple variables
beyond nondirectional statistical associations, while the latter quantifies the
multicomponent contributions (i.e., redundant, unique, and synergistic) of
different input data to the stellar mass estimation. Using data from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE),
we obtained meaningful results that provide physical interpretations for
image-based models. Our work demonstrates the gains from combining deep
learning with interpretability techniques, and holds promise in promoting more
data-driven astrophysical research (e.g., astrophysical parameter estimations
and investigations on complex multivariate physical processes).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-domain astronomy relies on effective analysis of stellar light curves, prompting the need for advanced encoders to improve accuracy and feature transferability.

Method: AstroCo leverages a Conformer-style architecture, integrating attention mechanisms, depthwise convolutions, and gating to analyze irregular stellar light curves.

embeddings that transfer effectively to few-shot classification. These results
highlight AstroCo's potential as a strong and label-efficient foundation for
time-domain astronomy.

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: The paper explores textual predictors in earnings press releases to forecast stock returns, finding FinBERT outperforms other methods and combining models improves prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of textual features in predicting stock returns during earnings announcements and analyze market behavior related to soft information.

Method: Compared traditional bag-of-words models with FinBERT-based embeddings; integrated topic analysis and real-time online learning for enhanced prediction and interpretability.

Result: Found textual content can match earnings surprise in predicting stock returns, FinBERT performs best, and press releases impact prices at market open.

Conclusion: Textual analysis enhances return prediction and interprets language's role in stock price formation, supporting real-time applications with self-serving managerial narratives observed.

Abstract: We examine how textual features in earnings press releases predict stock
returns on earnings announcement days. Using over 138,000 press releases from
2005 to 2023, we compare traditional bag-of-words and BERT-based embeddings. We
find that press release content (soft information) is as informative as
earnings surprise (hard information), with FinBERT yielding the highest
predictive power. Combining models enhances explanatory strength and
interpretability of the content of press releases. Stock prices fully reflect
the content of press releases at market open. If press releases are leaked, it
offers predictive advantage. Topic analysis reveals self-serving bias in
managerial narratives. Our framework supports real-time return prediction
through the integration of online learning, provides interpretability and
reveals the nuanced role of language in price formation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for improved prosody control, speaker adaptation, and expressiveness in voice conversion models inspired this research.

Method: The paper employs the VALLE-X framework for voice conversion, integrating a prosody-aware audio codec encoder (PACE) to refine and control prosody while maintaining speaker timbre.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed model outperforms baseline systems in prosody preservation, timbre consistency, and naturalness.

Conclusion: Integrating PACE into the VALLE-X framework enhances prosody control and model expressiveness, achieving better performance in voice conversion.

Abstract: Recent advances in discrete audio codecs have significantly improved speech
representation modeling, while codec language models have enabled in-context
learning for zero-shot speech synthesis. Inspired by this, we propose a voice
conversion (VC) model within the VALLE-X framework, leveraging its strong
in-context learning capabilities for speaker adaptation. To enhance prosody
control, we introduce a prosody-aware audio codec encoder (PACE) module, which
isolates and refines prosody from other sources, improving expressiveness and
control. By integrating PACE into our VC model, we achieve greater flexibility
in prosody manipulation while preserving speaker timbre. Experimental
evaluation results demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline VC
systems in prosody preservation, timbre consistency, and overall naturalness,
surpassing baseline VC systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Guitar On Audio and Tablatures (GOAT) dataset, a high-quality resource for guitar-related music information retrieval (MIR) tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations caused by the scarcity and inadequate annotations in existing guitar datasets, which hinder progress in MIR research for guitars.

Method: Developed the GOAT dataset containing 5.9 hours of high-quality recordings of electric guitars, supplemented by a data augmentation strategy using guitar amplifiers to extend audio variety. Included detailed annotations using guitar tablatures and multiple encoding formats.

Result: Demonstrated competitive results in MIDI transcription and new methods for guitar tablature transcription using the GOAT dataset.

Conclusion: GOAT can enable advancements in guitar-related MIR tasks like transcription, synthesis, and playing technique detection, thanks to its annotated and versatile dataset.

Abstract: In recent years, the guitar has received increased attention from the music
information retrieval (MIR) community driven by the challenges posed by its
diverse playing techniques and sonic characteristics. Mainly fueled by deep
learning approaches, progress has been limited by the scarcity and limited
annotations of datasets. To address this, we present the Guitar On Audio and
Tablatures (GOAT) dataset, comprising 5.9 hours of unique high-quality direct
input audio recordings of electric guitars from a variety of different guitars
and players. We also present an effective data augmentation strategy using
guitar amplifiers which delivers near-unlimited tonal variety, of which we
provide a starting 29.5 hours of audio. Each recording is annotated using
guitar tablatures, a guitar-specific symbolic format supporting string and fret
numbers, as well as numerous playing techniques. For this we utilise both the
Guitar Pro format, a software for tablature playback and editing, and a
text-like token encoding. Furthermore, we present competitive results using
GOAT for MIDI transcription and preliminary results for a novel approach to
automatic guitar tablature transcription. We hope that GOAT opens up the
possibilities to train novel models on a wide variety of guitar-related MIR
tasks, from synthesis to transcription to playing technique detection.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a prompt-aware framework for optimizing guidance scale in diffusion models, resulting in improved image and audio generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models use a fixed guidance scale during Classifier-Free Guidance, which often leads to oversaturation or weak alignment for varying prompts. The motivation is to address the lack of generalization across prompts.

Method: The authors create a large synthetic dataset by generating samples across multiple scales and scoring them using evaluation metrics. They use a lightweight predictor conditioned on semantic embeddings and linguistic complexity to estimate multi-metric quality curves and select the best scale via a regularized utility function.

Result: The proposed method shows consistent improvements in fidelity, alignment, and perceptual preference over standard Classifier-Free Guidance when tested on MSCOCO~2014 and AudioCaps datasets.

Conclusion: Prompt-aware scale selection significantly boosts the performance of pretrained diffusion models without requiring additional training, allowing for better quality in generated outputs.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in image and audio
generation, largely due to Classifier-Free Guidance. However, the choice of
guidance scale remains underexplored: a fixed scale often fails to generalize
across prompts of varying complexity, leading to oversaturation or weak
alignment. We address this gap by introducing a prompt-aware framework that
predicts scale-dependent quality and selects the optimal guidance at inference.
Specifically, we construct a large synthetic dataset by generating samples
under multiple scales and scoring them with reliable evaluation metrics. A
lightweight predictor, conditioned on semantic embeddings and linguistic
complexity, estimates multi-metric quality curves and determines the best scale
via a utility function with regularization. Experiments on MSCOCO~2014 and
AudioCaps show consistent improvements over vanilla CFG, enhancing fidelity,
alignment, and perceptual preference. This work demonstrates that prompt-aware
scale selection provides an effective, training-free enhancement for pretrained
diffusion backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the difficulty of building TTS systems for dialects due to data scarcity, inconsistent orthographies, and phonological complexity.

Method: Leverages an IPA-based representation, dialect-aware Mixture-of-Experts, and parameter-efficient low-rank and conditioning adapters for adaptability.

Result: Achieves natural and expressive TTS performance, excelling in zero-shot transfer for unseen dialects and specialized domains with minimal data.

Conclusion: DiaMoE-TTS provides an open-data, scalable approach to dialectal TTS synthesis, overcoming conventional resource limitations efficiently.

Abstract: Dialect speech embodies rich cultural and linguistic diversity, yet building
text-to-speech (TTS) systems for dialects remains challenging due to scarce
data, inconsistent orthographies, and complex phonetic variation. To address
these issues, we present DiaMoE-TTS, a unified IPA-based framework that
standardizes phonetic representations and resolves grapheme-to-phoneme
ambiguities. Built upon the F5-TTS architecture, the system introduces a
dialect-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to model phonological differences and
employs parameter-efficient adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptors (LoRA) and
Conditioning Adapters for rapid transfer to new dialects. Unlike approaches
dependent on large-scale or proprietary resources, DiaMoE-TTS enables scalable,
open-data-driven synthesis. Experiments demonstrate natural and expressive
speech generation, achieving zero-shot performance on unseen dialects and
specialized domains such as Peking Opera with only a few hours of data.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: ABC-Eval introduces the first open-source benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on symbolic music tasks using ABC notation. It demonstrates LLMs' current limitations in understanding and reasoning about symbolic music.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and evaluate the largely underexplored capabilities of large language models in understanding and reasoning about symbolic music notation tasks.

Method: The authors created ABC-Eval, a benchmark with 1,086 test samples across 10 sub-tasks. It focuses on evaluating LLMs on musical syntax comprehension and sequence-level reasoning in ABC notation.

Result: Seven state-of-the-art LLMs were tested, revealing significant limitations in their abilities to process symbolic music tasks. Individual baselines showed consistent performance across sub-tasks, validating the benchmark's reliability.

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle with symbolic music processing, highlighting the need for further development in this area. ABC-Eval provides a reliable framework for future evaluations and improvements.

Abstract: As large language models continue to develop, the feasibility and
significance of text-based symbolic music tasks have become increasingly
prominent. While symbolic music has been widely used in generation tasks, LLM
capabilities in understanding and reasoning about symbolic music remain largely
underexplored. To address this gap, we propose ABC-Eval, the first open-source
benchmark dedicated to the understanding and instruction-following capabilities
in text-based ABC notation scores. It comprises 1,086 test samples spanning 10
sub-tasks, covering scenarios from basic musical syntax comprehension to
complex sequence-level reasoning. Such a diverse scope poses substantial
challenges to models' ability to handle symbolic music tasks. We evaluated
seven state-of-the-art LLMs on ABC-Eval, and the results reveal notable
limitations in existing models' symbolic music processing capabilities.
Furthermore, the consistent performance of individual baselines across
different sub-tasks supports the reliability of our benchmark.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AudioRole, a dataset designed for improving audio role-playing in large language models, alongside an evaluation framework demonstrating significant model advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current advances in persona simulation mainly rely on text-based datasets, leaving audio role-playing underexplored due to challenges in semantic and vocal synchronization. The paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The authors developed AudioRole, a dataset with synchronized audio-text pairs alongside annotated metadata, and proposed ARP-Eval, a dual-aspect evaluation framework to test response quality and role fidelity.

Result: Empirical results show that the ARP-Model trained on AudioRole achieves significantly better Acoustic and Content Personalization scores compared to the original GLM-4-Voice and MiniCPM-O-2.6.

Conclusion: AudioRole, coupled with ARP-Eval, represents a notable advancement in audio-grounded role-playing, providing essential tools and methodologies for further research in this domain.

Abstract: The creation of high-quality multimodal datasets remains fundamental for
advancing role-playing capabilities in large language models (LLMs). While
existing works predominantly focus on text-based persona simulation, Audio
Role-Playing (ARP) presents unique challenges due to the need for synchronized
alignment of semantic content and vocal characteristics. To address this gap,
we propose AudioRole, a meticulously curated dataset from 13 TV series spanning
1K+ hours with 1M+ character-grounded dialogues, providing synchronized
audio-text pairs annotated with speaker identities and contextual metadata. In
addition, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the dataset, we introduced
ARP-Eval, a dual-aspect evaluation framework that assesses both response
quality and role fidelity. Empirical validation showing GLM-4-Voice trained on
AudioRole (which we called ARP-Model) achieve an average Acoustic
Personalization score of 0.31, significantly outperforming the original
GLM-4-voice and the more powerful model MiniCPM-O-2.6, which specifically
supports role-playing in one-shot scenarios. The ARP-Model also achieves a
Content Personalization score of 0.36, surpassing the untrained original model
by about 38% and maintaining the same level as MiniCPM-O-2.6.
  AudioRole features dialogues from over 115 main characters, 6 trained
ARP-Models that role-play different characters, and evaluation protocols.
Together, they provide an essential resource for advancing audio-grounded
role-playing research.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: MGM-Omni is a unified framework combining omnimodal understanding with long-horizon speech generation using a dual-track architecture, enabling efficient and expressive speech synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build a unified model that combines omnimodal understanding with controlled, long-duration speech generation by addressing inefficiencies in isolated, cascading pipelines.

Method: MGM-Omni employs a dual-track token-based architecture to separate multimodal reasoning from speech synthesis. It uses a unified training strategy, dual audio encoder for broader audio conditions, and a chunk-based parallel decoding scheme for efficient, zero-shot voice cloning with stable timbre.

Result: MGM-Omni outperformed existing open-source models in timbre preservation, natural speech generation, and omnimodal understanding. It also achieved data efficiency during training.

Conclusion: MGM-Omni sets a new standard for efficient, end-to-end omnimodal systems that excel in personalized and extended speech generation alongside robust multimodal comprehension.

Abstract: We present MGM-Omni, a unified Omni LLM for omni-modal understanding and
expressive, long-horizon speech generation. Unlike cascaded pipelines that
isolate speech synthesis, MGM-Omni adopts a "brain-mouth" design with a
dual-track, token-based architecture that cleanly decouples multimodal
reasoning from real-time speech generation. This design enables efficient
cross-modal interaction and low-latency, streaming speech generation. For
understanding, a unified training strategy coupled with a dual audio encoder
design enables long-form audio perception across diverse acoustic conditions.
For generation, a chunk-based parallel decoding scheme narrows the text speech
token-rate gap, accelerating inference and supporting streaming zero-shot voice
cloning with stable timbre over extended durations. Compared to concurrent
work, MGM-Omni achieves these capabilities with markedly data-efficient
training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGM-Omni outperforms existing
open source models in preserving timbre identity across extended sequences,
producing natural and context-aware speech, and achieving superior long-form
audio and omnimodal understanding. MGM-Omni establishes an efficient,
end-to-end paradigm for omnimodal understanding and controllable, personalised
long-horizon speech generation.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces IB-CAAN, a method for detecting speech deepfakes, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to combat the security risks posed by realistic speech deepfakes and address challenges in detection due to varying spoofing methods and conditions.

Method: The proposed IB-CAAN includes confidence-guided adversarial alignment to adaptively suppress attack artifacts while retaining discriminative cues, and an information bottleneck to eliminate irrelevant variability and enhance transferable features.

Result: IB-CAAN outperforms baseline approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets such as ASVspoof 2019/2021, ASVspoof 5, and In-the-Wild.

Conclusion: IB-CAAN is effective and robust for speech deepfake detection, highlighting its potential in addressing evolving deepfake threats.

Abstract: Neural speech synthesis techniques have enabled highly realistic speech
deepfakes, posing major security risks. Speech deepfake detection is
challenging due to distribution shifts across spoofing methods and variability
in speakers, channels, and recording conditions. We explore learning shared
discriminative features as a path to robust detection and propose Information
Bottleneck enhanced Confidence-Aware Adversarial Network (IB-CAAN).
Confidence-guided adversarial alignment adaptively suppresses attack-specific
artifacts without erasing discriminative cues, while the information bottleneck
removes nuisance variability to preserve transferable features. Experiments on
ASVspoof 2019/2021, ASVspoof 5, and In-the-Wild demonstrate that IB-CAAN
consistently outperforms baseline and achieves state-of-the-art performance on
many benchmarks.

Loss and ArcFace Loss for text-independent speaker identification using a
Convolutional Neural Network architecture based on the VGG16 model, modified to
accommodate mel spectrogram inputs of variable sizes generated from the
Voxceleb1 dataset. Our approach involves implementing both loss functions to
analyze their effects on model accuracy and robustness, where the Softmax loss
function was employed as a comparative baseline. Additionally, we examine how
the sizes of mel spectrograms and their varying time lengths influence model
performance. The experimental results demonstrate superior identification
accuracy compared to traditional Softmax loss methods. Furthermore, we discuss
the implications of these findings for future research.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces AudioMoG, a mixture-of-guidance framework for improving text-to-audio (T2A), video-to-audio (V2A), and other cross-modal audio generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guidance methods either emphasize fidelity (CFG) or diversity (AG), but typically rely on a single guiding principle, leaving untapped potential for combining multiple approaches.

Method: The authors propose AudioMoG, which combines complementary guiding principles, enabling parallel processing or focusing on individual principles under reduced forms, without loss of generality.

Result: AudioMoG outperforms single-guidance methods across tasks and sampling steps in T2A, V2A, text-to-music, and even image generation, achieving better quality without sacrificing inference speed.

Conclusion: Mixed guiding principles in the sampling stage yield better cross-modal generation quality with no additional costs in efficiency, demonstrating untapped potential in current systems.

Abstract: Guidance methods have demonstrated significant improvements in cross-modal
audio generation, including text-to-audio (T2A) and video-to-audio (V2A)
generation. The popularly adopted method, classifier-free guidance (CFG),
steers generation by emphasizing condition alignment, enhancing fidelity but
often at the cost of diversity. Recently, autoguidance (AG) has been explored
for audio generation, encouraging the sampling to faithfully reconstruct the
target distribution and showing increased diversity. Despite these advances,
they usually rely on a single guiding principle, e.g., condition alignment in
CFG or score accuracy in AG, leaving the full potential of guidance for audio
generation untapped. In this work, we explore enriching the composition of the
guidance method and present a mixture-of-guidance framework, AudioMoG. Within
the design space, AudioMoG can exploit the complementary advantages of
distinctive guiding principles by fulfilling their cumulative benefits. With a
reduced form, AudioMoG can consider parallel complements or recover a single
guiding principle, without sacrificing generality. We experimentally show that,
given the same inference speed, AudioMoG approach consistently outperforms
single guidance in T2A generation across sampling steps, concurrently showing
advantages in V2A, text-to-music, and image generation. These results highlight
a "free lunch" in current cross-modal audio generation systems: higher quality
can be achieved through mixed guiding principles at the sampling stage without
sacrificing inference efficiency. Demo samples are available at:

*Wei Zeng,Junchuan Zhao,Ye Wang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for expressive piano performance rendering and transcription, combining score content and performance style representations using a transformer-based model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify the tasks of expressive performance rendering (EPR) and automatic piano transcription (APT), which are fundamentally dual yet traditionally treated separately.

Method: The framework uses score and performance style disentangling methods along a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence architecture, paired with a diffusion-based style recommendation module for generating stylistic embeddings.

Result: Achieves competitive results in both EPR and APT tasks and demonstrates effective style-content disentanglement, style transfer, and rendering.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates score and style for piano tasks, offering a versatile solution for both expressive rendering and transcription with support for stylistic flexibility.

Abstract: Expressive performance rendering (EPR) and automatic piano transcription
(APT) are fundamental yet inverse tasks in music information retrieval: EPR
generates expressive performances from symbolic scores, while APT recovers
scores from performances. Despite their dual nature, prior work has addressed
them independently. In this paper we propose a unified framework that jointly
models EPR and APT by disentangling note-level score content and global
performance style representations from both paired and unpaired data. Our
framework is built on a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence architecture and
is trained using only sequence-aligned data, without requiring fine-grained
note-level alignment. To automate the rendering process while ensuring
stylistic compatibility with the score, we introduce an independent
diffusion-based performance style recommendation module that generates style
embeddings directly from score content. This modular component supports both
style transfer and flexible rendering across a range of expressive styles.
Experimental results from both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate
that our framework achieves competitive performance on EPR and APT tasks, while
enabling effective content-style disentanglement, reliable style transfer, and
stylistically appropriate rendering. Demos are available at

*Kai Li,Kejun Gao,Xiaolin Hu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dolphin, an efficient audio-visual speech separation (AVSS) model, achieving superior separation quality with substantially reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high computational cost and large parameter size of existing AVSS methods, making them unsuitable for applications where they serve as preprocessing steps.

Method: The proposed method, Dolphin, includes DP-LipCoder, a dual-path lightweight video encoder for extracting lip-motion features, and a lightweight audio separator using global-local attention (GLA) blocks to capture multi-scale dependencies.

Result: Dolphin exceeds state-of-the-art models in separation quality while offering significant efficiency improvements: over 50% fewer parameters, more than 2.4x reduction in MACs, and over 6x faster GPU inference.

Conclusion: Dolphin is a high-performance, efficient, and practical AVSS solution suitable for real-world deployment, combining strong separation quality with lightweight computational requirements.

Abstract: Audio-visual speech separation (AVSS) methods leverage visual cues to extract
target speech and have demonstrated strong separation quality in noisy acoustic
environments. However, these methods usually involve a large number of
parameters and require high computational cost, which is unacceptable in many
applications where speech separation serves as only a preprocessing step for
further speech processing. To address this issue, we propose an efficient AVSS
method, named Dolphin. For visual feature extraction, we develop DP-LipCoder, a
dual-path lightweight video encoder that transforms lip-motion into discrete
audio-aligned semantic tokens. For audio separation, we construct a lightweight
encoder-decoder separator, in which each layer incorporates a global-local
attention (GLA) block to efficiently capture multi-scale dependencies.
Experiments on three benchmark datasets showed that Dolphin not only surpassed
the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) model in separation quality but also
achieved remarkable improvements in efficiency: over 50% fewer parameters, more
than 2.4x reduction in MACs, and over 6x faster GPU inference speed. These
results indicate that Dolphin offers a practical and deployable solution for
high-performance AVSS in real-world scenarios. Our code and demo page are

Motivation: Most transcription models lack the capability to capture expressive and instrument-specific nuances like violin playing techniques.

Method: The authors developed VioPTT, an end-to-end model for violin technique-aware transcription, supported by the MOSA-VPT synthetic dataset.

Result: VioPTT shows strong generalization to real-world data and achieves state-of-the-art violin transcription performance.

Conclusion: The work is novel in combining violin transcription and playing technique prediction into a unified framework.

Abstract: While automatic music transcription is well-established in music information
retrieval, most models are limited to transcribing pitch and timing information
from audio, and thus omit crucial expressive and instrument-specific nuances.
One example is playing technique on the violin, which affords its distinct
palette of timbres for maximal emotional impact. Here, we propose
\textbf{VioPTT} (Violin Playing Technique-aware Transcription), a lightweight,
end-to-end model that directly transcribes violin playing technique in addition
to pitch onset and offset. Furthermore, we release \textbf{MOSA-VPT}, a novel,
high-quality synthetic violin playing technique dataset to circumvent the need
for manually labeled annotations. Leveraging this dataset, our model
demonstrated strong generalization to real-world note-level violin technique
recordings in addition to achieving state-of-the-art transcription performance.
To our knowledge, VioPTT is the first to jointly combine violin transcription
and playing technique prediction within a unified framework.

*Tianle Wang,Sirui Zhang,Xinyi Tong,Peiyang Yu,Jishang Chen,Liangke Zhao,Xinpu Gao,Yves Zhu,Tiezheng Ge,Bo Zheng,Duo Xu,Yang Liu,Xin Jin,Feng Yu,Songchun Zhu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces an unsupervised EM-based machine learning approach to identify fundamental recurring patterns ("music-words") in symbolic music data, achieving notable alignment with human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of extracting recurring structural patterns from symbolic music data, which reflect cognitive composition processes but suffer from semantic ambiguity in interpretation.

Method: The approach is a two-stage Expectation-Maximization (EM)-based framework: (1) creation of a music-word dictionary, and (2) reconstruction of the music data to optimize encoding.

Result: The proposed algorithm was evaluated against human expert annotations and achieved an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.61, indicating effective reduction of semantic ambiguity by minimizing code length.

Conclusion: The method successfully facilitates the extraction of basic musical building blocks, enabling structural analysis and applications in both AI music tasks and musicological research by leveraging principles of minimal encoding.

Abstract: This paper presents an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that
identifies recurring patterns -- referred to as ``music-words'' -- from
symbolic music data. These patterns are fundamental to musical structure and
reflect the cognitive processes involved in composition. However, extracting
these patterns remains challenging because of the inherent semantic ambiguity
in musical interpretation. We formulate the task of music-word discovery as a
statistical optimization problem and propose a two-stage
Expectation-Maximization (EM)-based learning framework: 1. Developing a
music-word dictionary; 2. Reconstructing the music data. When evaluated against
human expert annotations, the algorithm achieved an Intersection over Union
(IoU) score of 0.61. Our findings indicate that minimizing code length
effectively addresses semantic ambiguity, suggesting that human optimization of
encoding systems shapes musical semantics. This approach enables computers to
extract ``basic building blocks'' from music data, facilitating structural
analysis and sparse encoding. The method has two primary applications. First,
in AI music, it supports downstream tasks such as music generation,
classification, style transfer, and improvisation. Second, in musicology, it
provides a tool for analyzing compositional patterns and offers insights into
the principle of minimal encoding across diverse musical styles and composers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to streamline the tone-matching process for musicians by developing interpretable tools beyond typical audio replication methods.

Method: The study uses a dataset of piano recordings with varying EQ settings and evaluates both regression models and neural networks for predicting EQ parameter values.

Result: The neural network model demonstrated a high performance with a mean squared error of 0.0216 on tasks involving multiple EQ bands.

Conclusion: The proposed system offers a practical and adaptable solution for automated tone matching, which can be expanded to encompass a broader range of audio effects.

Abstract: This project presents an AI-based system for tone replication in music
production, focusing on predicting EQ parameter settings directly from audio
features. Unlike traditional audio-to-audio methods, our approach outputs
interpretable parameter values (e.g., EQ band gains) that musicians can further
adjust in their workflow. Using a dataset of piano recordings with
systematically varied EQ settings, we evaluate both regression and neural
network models. The neural network achieves a mean squared error of 0.0216 on
multi-band tasks. The system enables practical, flexible, and automated tone
matching for music producers and lays the foundation for extensions to more
complex audio effects.

Motivation: To address the challenge of creating musically coherent and aesthetically pleasing harmonies in algorithmic composition.

Method: Developed a multi-agent system with four specialized agents, including AI models like a Transformer-based Chord-Former and a GAN-based Audio Synthesizer, to perform collaborative composition tasks.

Result: The system generates sophisticated and contextually appropriate harmonic lines for melodies, with robust data processing and high-quality audio synthesis.

Conclusion: This framework mimics the collaborative process of human musicians, enabling effective harmony generation through modular, agent-based AI design.

Abstract: The generation of musically coherent and aesthetically pleasing harmony
remains a significant challenge in the field of algorithmic composition. This
paper introduces an innovative Agentic AI-enabled Higher Harmony Music
Generator, a multi-agent system designed to create harmony in a collaborative
and modular fashion. Our framework comprises four specialized agents: a
Music-Ingestion Agent for parsing and standardizing input musical scores; a
Chord-Knowledge Agent, powered by a Chord-Former (Transformer model), to
interpret and provide the constituent notes of complex chord symbols; a
Harmony-Generation Agent, which utilizes a Harmony-GPT and a Rhythm-Net (RNN)
to compose a melodically and rhythmically complementary harmony line; and an
Audio-Production Agent that employs a GAN-based Symbolic-to-Audio Synthesizer
to render the final symbolic output into high-fidelity audio. By delegating
specific tasks to specialized agents, our system effectively mimics the
collaborative process of human musicians. This modular, agent-based approach
allows for robust data processing, deep theoretical understanding, creative
composition, and realistic audio synthesis, culminating in a system capable of
generating sophisticated and contextually appropriate higher-voice harmonies
for given melodies.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper uses Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze hidden representations of audio pretrained models, specifically studying singing technique classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the unclear representations learned by audio pretrained models and to provide more insight into their internal structure.

Method: The authors used Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze hidden representations and assessed their capacity to retain information from both original representations and class labels.

Result: The study showed that SAEs retain meaningful information and improve disentanglement of vocal attributes, providing insights into self-supervised learning systems.

Conclusion: SAEs are effective tools for analyzing and understanding the underlying factors encoded in audio pretrained models' representations.

Abstract: Audio pretrained models are widely employed to solve various tasks in speech
processing, sound event detection, or music information retrieval. However, the
representations learned by these models are unclear, and their analysis mainly
restricts to linear probing of the hidden representations. In this work, we
explore the use of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze the hidden
representations of pretrained models, focusing on a case study in singing
technique classification. We first demonstrate that SAEs retain both
information about the original representations and class labels, enabling their
internal structure to provide insights into self-supervised learning systems.
Furthermore, we show that SAEs enhance the disentanglement of vocal attributes,
establishing them as an effective tool for identifying the underlying factors
encoded in the representations.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of using global pooling in probing audio self-supervised learning (SSL) models, introducing a lightweight alternative method called binarized prototypical probes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation paradigms for audio SSL models default to fine-tuning due to an information bottleneck in global pooling, which fails to represent dispersed, localized audio events effectively.

Method: The authors propose 'binarized prototypical probes,' a lightweight pooling method that learns prototypes for class-wise information aggregation, as an alternative to traditional linear probes.

Result: The proposed method outperforms linear and attentive probing across 13 datasets and 6 spectrogram-based encoders, demonstrating its efficacy.

Conclusion: The work suggests probing can serve as an efficient and competitive alternative to fine-tuning for evaluating audio SSL models, encouraging wider adoption of probing methods.

Abstract: Although probing frozen models has become a standard evaluation paradigm,
self-supervised learning in audio defaults to fine-tuning. A key reason is that
global pooling creates an information bottleneck causing linear probes to
misrepresent the embedding quality: The $\texttt{cls}$-token discards crucial
token information about dispersed, localized events in multi-label audio. This
weakness is rooted in the mismatch between the pretraining objective (operating
globally) and the downstream task (localized events). Across a comprehensive
benchmark of 13 datasets and 6 spectrogram-based encoders, we first investigate
the global pooling bottleneck. We then introduce binarized prototypical probes:
a lightweight and simple pooling method that learns prototypes to perform
class-wise information aggregation. Despite its simplicity, our method notably
outperforms linear and attentive probing. Our work establishes probing as a
competitive and efficient paradigm for evaluating audio SSL models, challenging
the reliance on costly fine-tuning.

Motivation: The research aims to address the difficulty of designing materials with targeted properties, like high-temperature superconductivity, due to the enormous chemical and structural possibilities.

Method: A DiffCSP foundation model is pretrained and fine-tuned using existing data, followed by guided sampling to generate candidates. A screening workflow using machine learning and DFT calculations evaluates stability and electronic properties.

Conclusion: The framework offers a structured approach to accelerate superconductor discovery but highlights challenges in achieving experimentally viable materials due to sparsely explored chemistries.

Abstract: The inverse design of materials with specific desired properties, such as
high-temperature superconductivity, represents a formidable challenge in
materials science due to the vastness of chemical and structural space. We
present a guided diffusion framework to accelerate the discovery of novel

Database and fine-tuned on 7,183 superconductors with first principles derived
labels. Employing classifier-free guidance, we sample 200,000 structures, which
lead to 34,027 unique candidates. A multistage screening process that combines
machine learning and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to assess
stability and electronic properties, identifies 773 candidates with
DFT-calculated $T_\mathrm{c}>5$ K. Notably, our generative model demonstrates
effective property-driven design. Our computational findings were validated
against experimental synthesis and characterization performed as part of this

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel method called STRAPSim for measuring portfolio similarity by considering semantic similarity, weight dynamics, and residual-aware alignment, outperforming existing measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional portfolio similarity measures rely on static metrics and exact overlaps, failing to capture nuanced relationships in partially overlapping portfolios with diverse weights.

Method: The authors propose STRAPSim, a two-level, residual-aware approach that computes portfolio similarity using semantic matching of constituents, portfolio-weight-based adjustments, and residual-aware greedy aggregation.

Result: STRAPSim outperformed existing methods like Jaccard and BERTScore-inspired variants in predictive accuracy, ranking alignment, and Spearman correlation with return-based similarity across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a scalable and interpretable framework for measuring structured asset basket similarity, with applications in ETF benchmarking, portfolio construction, and systematic execution.

Abstract: Accurately measuring portfolio similarity is critical for a wide range of
financial applications, including Exchange-traded Fund (ETF) recommendation,
portfolio trading, and risk alignment. Existing similarity measures often rely
on exact asset overlap or static distance metrics, which fail to capture
similarities among the constituents (e.g., securities within the portfolio) as
well as nuanced relationships between partially overlapping portfolios with
heterogeneous weights. We introduce STRAPSim (Semantic, Two-level,
Residual-Aware Portfolio Similarity), a novel method that computes portfolio
similarity by matching constituents based on semantic similarity, weighting
them according to their portfolio share, and aggregating results via
residual-aware greedy alignment. We benchmark our approach against Jaccard,
weighted Jaccard, as well as BERTScore-inspired variants across public
classification, regression, and recommendation tasks, as well as on corporate
bond ETF datasets. Empirical results show that our method consistently
outperforms baselines in predictive accuracy and ranking alignment, achieving
the highest Spearman correlation with return-based similarity. By leveraging
constituent-aware matching and dynamic reweighting, portfolio similarity offers
a scalable, interpretable framework for comparing structured asset baskets,
demonstrating its utility in ETF benchmarking, portfolio construction, and
systematic execution.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified deep learning framework that integrates LSTM, GAT, and sentiment analysis to optimize portfolio weights, outperforming benchmark methods on select U.S. stocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current portfolio optimization approaches often rely on a two-step forecasting and optimization process that can produce instability. The authors aim to design an end-to-end model leveraging deep learning to directly learn portfolio weights, improving stability and performance.

Method: The proposed method combines Long Short-Term Memory networks for temporal modeling, Graph Attention Networks for inter-stock relationship mapping, and sentiment analysis of financial news to incorporate market psychology, unified into a single pipeline to generate daily portfolio allocations.

Result: The framework achieves higher cumulative returns and Sharpe ratios compared to equal-weighted and CAPM-based benchmarks in tests conducted on nine U.S. stocks across six sectors.

Conclusion: Integrating temporal, relational, and sentiment information within a unified deep learning-based pipeline enhances portfolio optimization, demonstrating the potential to scale this approach to broader asset sets.

Abstract: Deep learning offers new tools for portfolio optimization. We present an
end-to-end framework that directly learns portfolio weights by combining Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to model temporal patterns, Graph Attention
Networks (GAT) to capture evolving inter-stock relationships, and sentiment
analysis of financial news to reflect market psychology. Unlike prior
approaches, our model unifies these elements in a single pipeline that produces
daily allocations. It avoids the traditional two-step process of forecasting
asset returns and then applying mean--variance optimization (MVO), a sequence
that can introduce instability. We evaluate the framework on nine U.S. stocks
spanning six sectors, chosen to balance sector diversity and news coverage. In
this setting, the model delivers higher cumulative returns and Sharpe ratios
than equal-weighted and CAPM-based MVO benchmarks. Although the stock universe
is limited, the results underscore the value of integrating price, relational,
and sentiment signals for portfolio management and suggest promising directions
for scaling the approach to larger, more diverse asset sets.

TL;DR: A nonlinear guidance law is presented for intercepting stationary targets amidst multiple defenders, utilizing geometric engagement zones rather than explicit strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently intercept a stationary target in a contested environment while addressing limitations in prior methods relying on defender strategies or conservative safety conditions.

Method: Combined repulsive safety and pursuit maneuvers based on engagement zones, using log-sum-exponent approximation for threat aggregation and embedding input saturation within vehicle dynamics.

Result: Numerical simulations confirm the method's effectiveness in avoiding defender interception zones and successfully achieving target interception under various conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed guidance law proves effective in contested scenarios, providing a stable and practical solution for interception while respecting vehicle actuator limits.

Abstract: This paper presents an input-constrained nonlinear guidance law to address
the problem of intercepting a stationary target in contested environments with
multiple defending agents. Contrary to prior approaches that rely on explicit
knowledge of defender strategies or utilize conservative safety conditions
based on a defender's range, our work characterizes defender threats
geometrically through engagement zones that delineate inevitable interception
regions. Outside these engagement zones, the interceptor remains invulnerable.
The proposed guidance law switches between a repulsive safety maneuver near
these zones and a pursuit maneuver outside their influence. To deal with
multiple engagement zones, we employ a smooth minimum function
(log-sum-exponent approximation) that aggregates threats from all the zones
while prioritizing the most critical threats. Input saturation is modeled and
embedded in the non-holonomic vehicle dynamics so the controller respects
actuator limits while maintaining stability. Numerical simulations with several
defenders demonstrate the proposed method's ability to avoid engagement zones
and achieve interception across diverse initial conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current threshold-based policies in NR SL networks lack the optimization capabilities needed for dynamic, coexistence-limited environments.

Method: The authors use DDQN reinforcement learning that incorporates multi-dimensional context, defining capacity-aware and QoS-constrained rewards.

Result: The scheduler outperforms static threshold policies, reducing resource blocking by up to 87.5% without compromising throughput.

Conclusion: The proposed E-agent scheduler provides context-aware, efficient resource allocation at the network edge, ensuring better performance under bandwidth constraints.

Abstract: In this paper, we present an agentic double deep Q-network (DDQN) scheduler
for licensed/unlicensed band allocation in New Radio (NR) sidelink (SL)
networks. Beyond conventional reward-seeking reinforcement learning (RL), the
agent perceives and reasons over a multi-dimensional context that jointly
captures queueing delay, link quality, coexistence intensity, and switching
stability. A capacity-aware, quality of service (QoS)-constrained reward aligns
the agent with goal-oriented scheduling rather than static thresholding. Under
constrained bandwidth, the proposed design reduces blocking by up to 87.5%
versus threshold policies while preserving throughput, highlighting the value
of context-driven decisions in coexistence-limited NR SL networks. The proposed
scheduler is an embodied agent (E-agent) tailored for task-specific,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing power flow analysis methods rely on parameters that may be unavailable or incorrect, and they struggle with evolving network topologies.

Method: A graph attention network (GAT)-based power flow rebuild model is constructed using voltage data, and its performance is compared with two state-of-the-art models.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates higher accuracy and better adaptability to varied network topologies compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The model effectively improves power flow analysis in changing networks with enhanced generalizability and accuracy.

Abstract: A full power flow (PF) model is a complete representation of the physical
power network. Traditional model-based methods rely on the full PF model to
implement power flow analysis. In practice, however, some PF model parameters
can be inaccurate or even unavailable due to the uncertainties or dynamics in
the power systems. Moreover, because the power network keeps evolving with
possibly changing topology, the generalizability of a PF model to different
network sizes and typologies should be considered. In this paper, we propose a
PF rebuild model based on graph attention networks (GAT) by constructing a new
graph based on the real and imaginary parts of voltage at each bus. By
comparing with two state-of-the-art PF rebuild models for different standard
IEEE power system cases and their modified topology variants, we demonstrate
the feasibility of our method. Experimental results show that our proposed
model achieves better accuracy for a changing network and can generalize to
different networks with less accuracy discount.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve energy efficiency, reduce latency, and maintain reliable network connectivity in 6G wireless networks by leveraging semantic awareness and generative AI on the edge.

Method: A lightweight MobileBERT language model is fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and deployed on UAVs to process multi-attribute flight and radio measurements for decision-making in handover scenarios.

Result: The approach achieves high accuracy in predicting handover decisions and strong performance in identifying contextual reasons, with an F1 micro-score of ~0.9 for reason tags on a synthetic dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of integrating generative AI and semantic communication for optimizing UAV handover, combining high decision accuracy with explainability.

Abstract: 6G wireless networks aim to exploit semantic awareness to optimize radio
resources. By optimizing the transmission through the lens of the desired goal,
the energy consumption of transmissions can also be reduced, and the latency
can be improved. To that end, this paper investigates a paradigm in which the
capabilities of generative AI (GenAI) on the edge are harnessed for network
optimization. In particular, we investigate an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
handover framework that takes advantage of GenAI and semantic communication to
maintain reliable connectivity. To that end, we propose a framework in which a
lightweight MobileBERT language model, fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), is deployed on the UAV. This model processes multi-attribute flight and
radio measurements and performs multi-label classification to determine
appropriate handover action. Concurrently, the model identifies an appropriate
set of contextual "Reason Tags" that elucidate the decision's rationale. Our
model, evaluated on a rule-based synthetic dataset of UAV handover scenarios,
demonstrates the model's high efficacy in learning these rules, achieving high
accuracy in predicting the primary handover decision. The model also shows
strong performance in identifying supporting reasons, with an F1 micro-score of
approximately 0.9 for reason tags.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reservoir computing, a machine learning tool for processing temporal data, traditionally employs randomly designed connectivity lacking principled optimization.

Method: The authors introduced a method to decouple RC dynamics into independent modes and optimize them based on eigenvalues of the RC adjacency matrix, enabling a targeted selection of optimal connectivity for specific tasks.

Result: The optimized RCs showed superior performance in training and testing compared to randomly constructed reservoirs and often outperformed nonlinear reservoirs of similar size.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates practical performance improvements and offers theoretical insights into designing efficient, task-specific, and analytically transparent RC architectures.

Abstract: Machine learning has become a fundamental approach for modeling, prediction,
and control, enabling systems to learn from data and perform complex tasks.
Reservoir computing is a machine learning tool that leverages high-dimensional
dynamical systems to efficiently process temporal data for prediction and
observation tasks. Traditionally, the connectivity of a reservoir computer (RC)
is generated at random, lacking a principled design. Here, we focus on
optimizing the topology of a linear RC to improve its performance and
interpretability, which we achieve by decoupling the RC dynamics into a number
of independent modes. We then proceed to optimize each one of these modes to
perform a given task, which corresponds to selecting an optimal RC connectivity
in terms of a given set of eigenvalues of the RC adjacency matrix. Simulations
on networks of varying sizes show that the optimized RC significantly
outperforms randomly constructed reservoirs in both the training and testing
phases and also often surpasses nonlinear reservoirs of comparable size. This
approach provides both practical performance advantages and theoretical
guidelines for designing efficient, task-specific, and analytically transparent
RC architectures.

*Kyung-bin Kwon,Lintao Ye,Vijay Gupta,Hao Zhu*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a risk-constrained framework to address communication delays and uncertainties in wide-area damping control (WADC) for power systems, leveraging reinforcement learning to outperform traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication delays and other uncertainties in power system controls significantly hinder performance and reliability, making existing delay estimation methods insufficient for addressing broader uncertainties and cyber-physical challenges.

Method: A risk-constrained framework was developed that incorporates mean-variance risk into the cost function of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR). Reinforcement learning (RL) using a stochastic gradient-descent with max-oracle (SGDmax) algorithm was applied to optimize performance without delay estimation.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrated effective mitigation of large communication delays and improved worst-case performance through numerical tests on the IEEE 68-bus system. It significantly outperformed traditional delay compensator-based methods, especially under estimation errors.

Conclusion: The risk-constrained framework and RL-based solution are highly effective in improving performance under communication delays, while also addressing broader cyber uncertainties. This novel method shows promise for enhancing the robustness of power system controls.

Abstract: Non-ideal communication links, especially delays, critically affect fast
networked controls in power systems, such as the wide-area damping control
(WADC). Traditionally, a delay estimation and compensation approach is adopted
to address this cyber-physical coupling, but it demands very high accuracy for
the fast WADC and cannot handle other cyber concerns like link failures or
{cyber perturbations}. Hence, we propose a new risk-constrained framework that
can target the communication delays, yet amenable to general uncertainty under
the cyber-physical couplings. Our WADC model includes the synchronous
generators (SGs), and also voltage source converters (VSCs) for additional
damping capabilities. To mitigate uncertainty, a mean-variance risk constraint
is introduced to the classical optimal control cost of the linear quadratic
regulator (LQR). Unlike estimating delays, our approach can effectively
mitigate large communication delays by improving the worst-case performance. A
reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm, namely, stochastic
gradient-descent with max-oracle (SGDmax), is developed to solve the
risk-constrained problem. We further show its guaranteed convergence to
stationarity at a high probability, even using the simple zero-order policy
gradient (ZOPG). Numerical tests on the IEEE 68-bus system not only verify
SGDmax's convergence and VSCs' damping capabilities, but also demonstrate that
our approach outperforms conventional delay compensator-based methods under
estimation error. While focusing on performance improvement under large delays,
our proposed risk-constrained design can effectively mitigate the worst-case
oscillations, making it equally effective for addressing other communication
issues and cyber perturbations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional control methods for DPS are computationally expensive or infeasible when explicit coarse-grained equations or fine-scale black-box simulators are unavailable.

Method: The authors use local neural operators trained on spatiotemporal microscopic/mesoscopic data as surrogates for short-time solution operators. These are integrated with Krylov subspace methods to compute steady/unsteady-states, determine Jacobian information, and approximate eigenspectrums.

Result: The approach enables reduced-order modeling of slow dynamics without requiring explicit Jacobian assembly and facilitates control design using discrete-time Linear Quadratic Regulator (dLQR) and pole-placement (PP) methods.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates an efficient and scalable approach to controlling DPS by leveraging data-driven methods and neural operators, thus bypassing the limitations of traditional computational methods.

Abstract: The control of high-dimensional distributed parameter systems (DPS) remains a
challenge when explicit coarse-grained equations are unavailable. Classical
equation-free (EF) approaches rely on fine-scale simulators treated as
black-box timesteppers. However, repeated simulations for steady-state
computation, linearization, and control design are often computationally
prohibitive, or the microscopic timestepper may not even be available, leaving
us with data as the only resource. We propose a data-driven alternative that
uses local neural operators, trained on spatiotemporal microscopic/mesoscopic
data, to obtain efficient short-time solution operators. These surrogates are
employed within Krylov subspace methods to compute coarse steady and
unsteady-states, while also providing Jacobian information in a matrix-free
manner. Krylov-Arnoldi iterations then approximate the dominant eigenspectrum,
yielding reduced models that capture the open-loop slow dynamics without
explicit Jacobian assembly. Both discrete-time Linear Quadratic Regulator
(dLQR) and pole-placement (PP) controllers are based on this reduced system and
lifted back to the full nonlinear dynamics, thereby closing the feedback loop.

*Vincent Froese,Moritz Grillo,Christoph Hertrich,Moritz Stargalla*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: The paper explores computational complexity in verifying properties of 2-layer and 3-layer ReLU networks, solving open questions and establishing hardness results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the complexity of verifying properties in ReLU neural networks is crucial for advancing theoretical studies and applications in machine learning.

Method: The paper uses parameterized complexity theory, proving W[1] and NP-hardness for network verification tasks and geometrical containment problems.

Result: Key tasks in network verification, including positivity, Lipschitz constant computation, and zonotope containment, are proven to have computational constraints like W[1]-hardness and NP-hardness.

Conclusion: These findings show that current enumeration-based methods are essentially optimal, reinforcing the inherent computational difficulty of these tasks.

Abstract: Neural networks with ReLU activations are a widely used model in machine
learning. It is thus important to have a profound understanding of the
properties of the functions computed by such networks. Recently, there has been
increasing interest in the (parameterized) computational complexity of
determining these properties. In this work, we close several gaps and resolve
an open problem posted by Froese et al. [COLT '25] regarding the parameterized
complexity of various problems related to network verification. In particular,
we prove that deciding positivity (and thus surjectivity) of a function
$f\colon\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ computed by a 2-layer ReLU network is
W[1]-hard when parameterized by $d$. This result also implies that zonotope
(non-)containment is W[1]-hard with respect to $d$, a problem that is of
independent interest in computational geometry, control theory, and robotics.
Moreover, we show that approximating the maximum within any multiplicative
factor in 2-layer ReLU networks, computing the $L_p$-Lipschitz constant for
$p\in(0,\infty]$ in 2-layer networks, and approximating the $L_p$-Lipschitz
constant in 3-layer networks are NP-hard and W[1]-hard with respect to $d$.
Notably, our hardness results are the strongest known so far and imply that the
naive enumeration-based methods for solving these fundamental problems are all
essentially optimal under the Exponential Time Hypothesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding and diagnostic methods for heart recovery dynamics.

Method: Data from polycardiograph biosignals is analyzed using multifractal features and five supervised classification algorithms (LogReg, SVM-RBF, kNN, DT, RF).

Result: Multifractal features and multimodal sensing reliably characterized recovery states. Classification algorithms showed effectiveness on a small, imbalanced dataset.

Conclusion: Combining multifractal analysis with multimodal sensing offers promising nonlinear diagnostic methods for heart conditions.

Abstract: We investigate the recovery dynamics of healthy cardiac activity after
physical exertion using multimodal biosignals recorded with a polycardiograph.
Multifractal features derived from the singularity spectrum capture the
scale-invariant properties of cardiovascular regulation. Five supervised
classification algorithms - Logistic Regression (LogReg), Suport Vector Machine
with RBF kernel (SVM-RBF), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Tree (DT), and
Random Forest (RF) - were evaluated to distinguish recovery states in a small,
imbalanced dataset. Our results show that multifractal analysis, combined with
multimodal sensing, yields reliable features for characterizing recovery and
points toward nonlinear diagnostic methods for heart conditions.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces CPTAC-PROTSTRUCT, the first instruction-tuning dataset for oncology, and KRONOS, a graph-LLM framework for proteomics-driven clinical reasoning, showing potential in precision medicine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding proteomics data is crucial for realizing advancements in oncology-related precision medicine; however, challenges arise from the lack of datasets for clinical interpretation and the inadequacy of current LLM architectures for molecular data.

Method: Creation of CPTAC-PROTSTRUCT, a dataset with over 400k examples based on large-scale cancer proteomics, and development of KRONOS, an innovative graph-LLM framework incorporating molecular interaction topology for patient-specific modeling.

Result: KRONOS demonstrated strong outcomes in clinical tasks like molecular classification, temporal trajectory analysis, and tumor stage prediction, highlighting its capability in processing proteomics data.

Conclusion: The study represents a significant step in integrating multimodal LLMs with proteomics data to enhance patient-level precision medicine, offering potential improvements in diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy optimization.

Abstract: Proteomics data is essential to pathogenic understanding of a disease
phenotype. In cancer, analysis of molecular signatures enables precision
medicine through the identification of biological processes that drive
individualized tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, and clinical
heterogeneity. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capacity to integrate and reason across heterogeneous data
modalities. However, performing multi-modal language modeling for molecular
understanding of patient-specific proteomics remains a significant challenge
due to two barriers: (1) the lack of instruction-tuning datasets that enable
clinical interpretation from proteomics data, and (2) the absence of language
modeling architectures designed to capture the rich heterogeneity of molecular
data. In this work, we introduce CPTAC-PROTSTRUCT, the first instruction tuning
dataset for molecular understanding of oncology, comprising over 400k
open-ended examples derived from individualized proteomic profiles curated from
the largest national proteomics cancer study (CPTAC). Additionally, we propose
KRONOS (Knowledge Representation of patient Omics Networks in Oncology via
Structured tuning), a novel graph-LLM framework that leverages molecular
interaction topology with proteomics to learn patient-specific graph
representations for enhanced clinical reasoning. We show that KRONOS achieves
competitive performance across benchmark clinical tasks, including molecular
classification, temporal trajectory modeling, and tumor stage prediction from
proteomics data. Ultimately, this approach empowers LLMs to understand
patient-level pathogenesis, advancing precision medicine through more accurate
diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment stratification.

*Nimisha Ghosh,Dheeran Sankaran,Rahul Balakrishnan Adhi,Sharath S,Amrut Anand*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This paper introduces LAMP-PRo, a framework using pre-trained protein language models, attention mechanisms, and multi-label learning to improve differentiation between DNA-, RNA-, and dual-binding proteins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to differentiate between similar DNA- and RNA-binding proteins and face challenges in identifying proteins binding to both DNA and RNA.

Method: The framework uses pre-trained protein language models for embedding, CNN for sequence analysis, multi-head and label-aware attention for contextual learning, and a novel cross-label attention mechanism for dependency capture.

Result: In experiments, LAMP-PRo demonstrated superior and consistent prediction accuracy compared to other methods. Model interpretability was provided through sequence relevance visualization.

Conclusion: LAMP-PRo effectively addresses challenges in predicting DNA-, RNA-, and dual-binding proteins, offering a powerful tool for molecular and cellular function analysis.

Abstract: Identifying DNA- (DBPs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is crucial for the
understanding of cell function, molecular interactions as well as regulatory
functions. Owing to their high similarity, most of the existing approaches face
challenges in differentiating between DBPs and RBPs leading to high
cross-prediction errors. Moreover, identifying proteins which bind to both DNA
and RNA (DRBPs) is also quite a challenging task. In this regard, we propose a
novel framework viz. LAMP-PRo which is based on pre-trained protein language
model (PLM), attention mechanisms and multi-label learning to mitigate these
issues. First, pre-trained PLM such ESM-2 is used for embedding the protein
sequences followed by convolutional neural network (CNN). Subsequently
multi-head self-attention mechanism is applied for the contextual information
while label-aware attention is used to compute class-specific representations
by attending to the sequence in a way that is tailored to each label (DBP, RBP
and non-NABP) in a multi-label setup. We have also included a novel cross-label
attention mechanism to explicitly capture dependencies between DNA- and
RNA-binding proteins, enabling more accurate prediction of DRBP. Finally, a
linear layer followed by a sigmoid function are used for the final prediction.
Extensive experiments are carried out to compare LAMP-PRo with the existing
methods wherein the proposed model shows consistent competent performance.
Furthermore, we also provide visualization to showcase model interpretability,
highlighting which parts of the sequence are most relevant for a predicted
label. The original datasets are available at http://bliulab.net/iDRBP\_MMC and
the codes are available at https://github.com/NimishaGhosh/LAMP-PRo.

*Ilari Vallivaara,Katja Poikselkä,Pauli Rikula,Juha Röning*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient sampling method that combines the Alias method and systematic sampling, outperforming traditional methods for discrete distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and accuracy of sampling from discrete distributions, particularly for applications like particle filters.

Method: The method integrates the Alias method with systematic sampling for low-variance resampling and evaluates goodness-of-fit using a modified Cramér-Von Mises statistic.

Result: It shows up to an order of magnitude faster sampling compared to binary search or inversion methods and performs favorably in goodness-of-fit tests for empirical distributions.

Conclusion: The method offers a general and highly efficient approach to discrete sampling, applicable in scenarios such as particle filter proposal distributions in robotics.

Abstract: In this paper we combine the Alias method with the concept of systematic
sampling, a method commonly used in particle filters for efficient low-variance
resampling. The proposed method allows very fast sampling from a discrete
distribution: drawing k samples is up to an order of magnitude faster than
binary search from the cumulative distribution function (cdf) or inversion
methods used in many libraries. The produced empirical distribution function is
evaluated using a modified Cram\'er-Von Mises goodness-of-fit statistic,
showing that the method compares very favourably to multinomial sampling. As
continuous distributions can often be approximated with discrete ones, the
proposed method can be used as a very general way to efficiently produce random
samples for particle filter proposal distributions, e.g. for motion models in
robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational inaccuracies in neural networks, which lead to deviations from predicted mathematical behavior and impact reliability and interpretability.

Method: The authors propose algorithms and data structures integrated into neural network libraries for tracking floating-point precision loss during training and inference.

Result: Numerical experiments reveal how precision loss impacts inference, gradients, and deviations from mathematical predictions in neural networks.

Conclusion: Tracking computational inaccuracies is essential for ensuring reliable inference, effective training, and improved interpretability in neural networks.

Abstract: We describe algorithms and data structures to extend a neural network library
with automatic precision estimation for floating point computations. We also
discuss conditions to make estimations exact and preserve high computation
performance of neural networks training and inference. Numerical experiments
show the consequences of significant precision loss for particular values such
as inference, gradients and deviations from mathematically predicted behavior.
  It turns out that almost any neural network accumulates computational
inaccuracies. As a result, its behavior does not coincide with predicted by the
mathematical model of neural network. This shows that tracking of computational
inaccuracies is important for reliability of inference, training and
interpretability of results.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Seismic,' a novel and efficient algorithm for sparse Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by sparse embeddings in ANNS and encourage further research in this field.

Method: The authors propose new data structures and algorithms: a sketching algorithm to reduce dimensionality while maintaining ranks, a geometric organization of the inverted index, and blending global-local information for better ANNS performance.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves sub-millisecond query latency with high accuracy on benchmark datasets using a single CPU.

Conclusion: The proposed innovations, when combined, lead to a fast and accurate solution for sparse ANNS, encouraging advancements in the domain.

Abstract: Sparse embeddings of data form an attractive class due to their inherent
interpretability: Every dimension is tied to a term in some vocabulary, making
it easy to visually decipher the latent space. Sparsity, however, poses unique
challenges for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) which finds, from a
collection of vectors, the k vectors closest to a query. To encourage research
on this underexplored topic, sparse ANNS featured prominently in a BigANN
Challenge at NeurIPS 2023, where approximate algorithms were evaluated on large
benchmark datasets by throughput and accuracy. In this work, we introduce a set
of novel data structures and algorithmic methods, a combination of which leads
to an elegant, effective, and highly efficient solution to sparse ANNS. Our
contributions range from a theoretically-grounded sketching algorithm for
sparse vectors to reduce their effective dimensionality while preserving inner
product-induced ranks; a geometric organization of the inverted index; and the
blending of local and global information to improve the efficiency and efficacy
of ANNS. Empirically, our final algorithm, dubbed Seismic, reaches
sub-millisecond per-query latency with high accuracy on a large-scale benchmark
dataset using a single CPU.

*Maryam Boubekraoui,Ridwane Tahiri*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper proposes an accelerated Newton-GMRES method for solving multilinear PageRank problems, which enhances efficiency and scalability using Krylov subspace techniques and vector extrapolation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational challenges of solving multilinear PageRank problems, especially due to the inefficiency of classical Newton-based methods in large-scale networks.

Method: The study introduces an accelerated Newton-GMRES approach, incorporating Krylov subspace techniques for approximate Newton steps and vector extrapolation methods (MPE, RRE, AA) to boost convergence and stability.

Result: Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data confirm that the proposed method outperforms traditional Newton-based solvers in terms of efficiency, robustness, and scalability.

Conclusion: The accelerated Newton-GMRES method is an effective and scalable solution for multilinear PageRank problems, demonstrating improved performance over classical methods in practical applications.

Abstract: Modeling complex multiway relationships in large-scale networks is becoming
more and more challenging in data science. The multilinear PageRank problem,
arising naturally in the study of higher-order Markov chains, is a powerful
framework for capturing such interactions, with applications in web ranking,
recommendation systems, and social network analysis. It extends the classical
Google PageRank model to a tensor-based formulation, leading to a nonlinear
system that captures multi-way dependencies between states. Newton-based
methods can achieve local quadratic convergence for this problem, but they
require solving a large linear system at each iteration, which becomes too
costly for large-scale applications. To address this challenge, we present an
accelerated Newton-GMRES method that leverages Krylov subspace techniques to
approximate the Newton step without explicitly forming the large Jacobian
matrix. We further employ vector extrapolation methods, including Minimal
Polynomial Extrapolation (MPE), Reduced Rank Extrapolation (RRE), and Anderson
Acceleration (AA), to improve the convergence rate and enhance numerical
stability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate
that the proposed approach significantly outperforms classical Newton-based
solvers in terms of efficiency, robustness, and scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting optimal network structures for DNNs is crucial but challenging, especially for handling large datasets or problems with many input variables.

Method: The paper proposes DPS, a method using a difference penalty for knot placement and the ECM algorithm for latent variable modeling to optimize DNN structures with theoretical guarantees.

Result: DPS demonstrates improved effectiveness in handling high-dimensional datasets and surpasses traditional nonparametric regression in performance through numerical validation.

Conclusion: DPS provides a robust framework for nonlinear regression tasks, offering computational efficiency and overcoming dimensionality challenges inherent in large-scale problems.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied to solve real-world
regression problems. However, selecting optimal network structures remains a
significant challenge. This study addresses this issue by linking neuron
selection in DNNs to knot placement in basis expansion techniques. We introduce
a difference penalty that automates knot selection, thereby simplifying the
complexities of neuron selection. We name this method Deep P-Spline (DPS). This
approach extends the class of models considered in conventional DNN modeling
and forms the basis for a latent variable modeling framework using the
Expectation-Conditional Maximization (ECM) algorithm for efficient network
structure tuning with theoretical guarantees. From a nonparametric regression
perspective, DPS is proven to overcome the curse of dimensionality, enabling
the effective handling of datasets with a large number of input variable, a
scenario where conventional nonparametric regression methods typically
underperform. This capability motivates the application of the proposed
methodology to computer experiments and image data analyses, where the
associated regression problems involving numerous inputs are common. Numerical
results validate the effectiveness of the model, underscoring its potential for
advanced nonlinear regression tasks.

TL;DR: The paper explores the convergence of graph Dirichlet energies and Laplacians on intersecting manifolds of different dimensions, with implications for machine learning, demonstrating how normalization impacts dimensional sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from challenges in machine learning where real-world data often consists of components with varied intrinsic dimensions, necessitating methods that adapt to this heterogeneity.

Method: The study analyzes both unnormalized and normalized graph Dirichlet energies, proving that the normalized energy adapts to mixed-dimensional manifolds while the unnormalized energy focuses on the highest-dimensional manifold. It establishes spectral convergence and supports findings with numerical experiments.

Result: The unnormalized graph Laplacian only captures variations within the highest-dimensional manifold, whereas the normalized version adapts to multiple dimensions. Related spectral convergence is proven and validated through simulations.

Conclusion: The normalized graph Dirichlet energy is shown to be superior for adapting to datasets with diverse dimensionalities, offering crucial insights for designing adaptable machine learning methods.

Abstract: We study $\Gamma$-convergence of graph Dirichlet energies and spectral
convergence of graph Laplacians on unions of intersecting manifolds of
potentially different dimensions. Our investigation is motivated by problems of
machine learning, as real-world data often consist of parts or classes with
different intrinsic dimensions. An important challenge is to understand which
machine learning methods adapt to such varied dimensionalities. We investigate
the standard unnormalized and the normalized graph Dirichlet energies. We show
that the unnormalized energy and its associated graph Laplacian asymptotically
only sees the variations within the manifold of the highest dimension. On the
other hand, we prove that the normalized Dirichlet energy converges to a
(tensorized) Dirichlet energy on the union of manifolds that adapts to all
dimensions simultaneously. We also establish the related spectral convergence
and present a few numerical experiments to illustrate our findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the rigidity and brittleness of existing LLM-powered multi-agent systems in dynamic, real-world environments, and to enable autonomous adaptation and orchestration of agent systems.

Method: The authors propose a tri-agent architecture (generator-implementer-rectifier) capable of dynamic composition and rectification. They use Collaborative Tree Optimization to train meta-agents and improve adaptability.

Result: MAS$^2$ demonstrated up to 19.6% higher performance in demanding tasks like deep research and code generation, along with up to 15.1% better cross-backbone generalization using unseen LLMs, all while being cost-effective.

Conclusion: MAS$^2$ represents a significant advancement in LLM-powered multi-agent systems, showcasing adaptability, better performance, and generalization without excessive computational cost, thereby broadening its applicability to diverse real-world challenges.

Abstract: The past two years have witnessed the meteoric rise of Large Language Model
(LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS), which harness collective intelligence
and exhibit a remarkable trajectory toward self-evolution. This paradigm has
rapidly progressed from manually engineered systems that require bespoke
configuration of prompts, tools, roles, and communication protocols toward
frameworks capable of automated orchestration. Yet, dominant automatic
multi-agent systems, whether generated by external modules or a single LLM
agent, largely adhere to a rigid ``\textit{generate-once-and-deploy}''
paradigm, rendering the resulting systems brittle and ill-prepared for the
dynamism and uncertainty of real-world environments. To transcend this
limitation, we introduce MAS$^2$, a paradigm predicated on the principle of
recursive self-generation: a multi-agent system that autonomously architects
bespoke multi-agent systems for diverse problems. Technically, we devise a
``\textit{generator-implementer-rectifier}'' tri-agent team capable of
dynamically composing and adaptively rectifying a target agent system in
response to real-time task demands. Collaborative Tree Optimization is proposed
to train and specialize these meta-agents. Extensive evaluation across seven
benchmarks reveals that MAS$^2$ achieves performance gains of up to $19.6\%$
over state-of-the-art MAS in complex scenarios such as deep research and code
generation. Moreover, MAS$^2$ exhibits superior cross-backbone generalization,
effectively leveraging previously unseen LLMs to yield improvements of up to
$15.1\%$. Crucially, these gains are attained without incurring excessive token
costs, as MAS$^2$ consistently resides on the Pareto frontier of
cost-performance trade-offs. The source codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges associated with scalability and consistency in high-dimensional decision-making tasks using heterogeneous data.

Method: The PartnerMAS framework is designed with three hierarchical layers: Planner Agent, Specialized Agents, and a Supervisor Agent. A new benchmark dataset is also introduced to evaluate the framework.

Result: PartnerMAS delivers consistently higher match rates (10--15% improvement) over baseline systems across 140 cases. It also provides explainable reasoning and complementary feature assessments among agents.

Conclusion: Structured collaboration in multi-agent frameworks like PartnerMAS outperforms single-agent scaling in high-dimensional decision-making tasks, making it a promising tool in data-rich domains.

Abstract: High-dimensional decision-making tasks, such as business partner selection,
involve evaluating large candidate pools with heterogeneous numerical,
categorical, and textual features. While large language models (LLMs) offer
strong in-context reasoning capabilities, single-agent or debate-style systems
often struggle with scalability and consistency in such settings. We propose
PartnerMAS, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes evaluation
into three layers: a Planner Agent that designs strategies, Specialized Agents
that perform role-specific assessments, and a Supervisor Agent that integrates
their outputs. To support systematic evaluation, we also introduce a curated
benchmark dataset of venture capital co-investments, featuring diverse firm
attributes and ground-truth syndicates. Across 140 cases, PartnerMAS
consistently outperforms single-agent and debate-based multi-agent baselines,
achieving up to 10--15\% higher match rates. Analysis of agent reasoning shows
that planners are most responsive to domain-informed prompts, specialists
produce complementary feature coverage, and supervisors play an important role
in aggregation. Our findings demonstrate that structured collaboration among
LLM agents can generate more robust outcomes than scaling individual models,
highlighting PartnerMAS as a promising framework for high-dimensional
decision-making in data-rich domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy in existing nonlinear filtering methods.

Method: Develops a power series expansion of the conditional expectation based on system noise level, solved through ordinary differential equations, and includes an Edgeworth-type expansion for complex distribution features.

Result: Improves in capturing multimodality and other complex characteristics of conditional distributions with lower computational cost compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves more efficient and accurate nonlinear filtering than traditional approaches.

Abstract: We propose a new asymptotic expansion method for nonlinear filtering, based
on a small parameter in the system noise. The conditional expectation is
expanded as a power series in the noise level, with each coefficient computed
by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. This approach mitigates
the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy inherent in
existing methods such as Gaussian approximations and particle filters.
Moreover, by incorporating an Edgeworth-type expansion, our method captures
complex features of the conditional distribution, such as multimodality, with
significantly lower computational cost than conventional filtering algorithms.

Abstract: This letter proposes a YOLO-based framework for spatial bearing fault

models to classify fault types. Evaluated on three benchmark datasets,
including Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Paderborn University (PU),
and Intelligent Maintenance System (IMS), the proposed CWT-YOLO pipeline
achieves significantly higher accuracy and generalizability than the baseline

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a green learning (GL)-based precoding framework for STAR-RIS-aided mmWave MIMO broadcasting systems, focusing on energy efficiency with a CSI-free inference design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for environmentally sustainable and energy-efficient solutions in 6G networks, while handling scenarios with identical information broadcasting to multiple users.

Method: The GL framework avoids conventional BCD and DL methods, relying instead on direct processing of received uplink pilot signals without explicit CSI estimation. It uses Saab, RFT, and XGBoost for lightweight yet efficient prediction of STAR-RIS coefficients and transmit precoding.

Result: The GL framework achieves competitive spectral efficiency compared to BCD and DL models, while reducing computational cost (FLOPs) by over four orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: GL's lightweight, CSI-free design makes it apt for real-time, energy-, and hardware-constrained broadcasting, offering a sustainable solution for future 6G networks.

Abstract: In this paper, a green learning (GL)-based precoding framework is proposed
for simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent
surface (STAR-RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO broadcasting systems.
Motivated by the growing emphasis on environmental sustainability in future 6G
networks, this work adopts a broadcasting transmission architecture for
scenarios where multiple users share identical information, improving spectral
efficiency and reducing redundant transmissions and power consumption.
Different from conventional optimization methods, such as block coordinate
descent (BCD) that require perfect channel state information (CSI) and
iterative computation, the proposed GL framework operates directly on received
uplink pilot signals without explicit CSI estimation. Unlike deep learning (DL)
approaches that require CSI-based labels for training, the proposed GL approach
also avoids deep neural networks and backpropagation, leading to a more
lightweight design. Although the proposed GL framework is trained with
supervision generated by BCD under full CSI, inference is performed in a fully
CSI-free manner. The proposed GL integrates subspace approximation with
adjusted bias (Saab), relevant feature test (RFT)-based supervised feature
selection, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based decision learning to
jointly predict the STAR-RIS coefficients and transmit precoder. Simulation
results show that the proposed GL approach achieves competitive spectral
efficiency compared to BCD and DL-based models, while reducing floating-point
operations (FLOPs) by over four orders of magnitude. These advantages make the
proposed GL approach highly suitable for real-time deployment in energy- and
hardware-constrained broadcasting scenarios.

*Po-Heng Chou,Jiun-Jia Wu,Wan-Jen Huang,Ronald Y. Chang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A proposed LSTM-based precoding method for RIS-assisted mmWave MIMO systems achieves high spectral efficiency with low computation time and energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an energy-efficient and practical precoding framework for 6G wireless networks while addressing hardware constraints and reducing complexity.

Method: An LSTM-based framework utilizing uplink pilot sequences to implicitly learn channel characteristics, addressing RIS hardware constraints and employing a multi-label training strategy.

Result: Achieved over 90% spectral efficiency with only 2.2% computation time of exhaustive search, reducing energy consumption significantly and demonstrating scalability and robustness.

Conclusion: The framework is a sustainable and efficient solution for 6G networks, minimizing energy usage and maintaining performance under various conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a sustainable long short-term memory (LSTM)-based
precoding framework for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted
millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems. Instead of explicit channel state
information (CSI) estimation, the framework exploits uplink pilot sequences to
implicitly learn channel characteristics, reducing both pilot overhead and
inference complexity. Practical hardware constraints are addressed by
incorporating the phase-dependent amplitude model of RIS elements, while a
multi-label training strategy improves robustness when multiple near-optimal
codewords yield comparable performance. Simulations show that the proposed
design achieves over 90% of the spectral efficiency of exhaustive search (ES)
with only 2.2% of its computation time, cutting energy consumption by nearly
two orders of magnitude. The method also demonstrates resilience under
distribution mismatch and scalability to larger RIS arrays, making it a
practical and energy-efficient solution for sustainable 6G wireless networks.

### [1303] [Generative Modeling and Decision Fusion for Unknown Event Detection and Classification Using Synchrophasor Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22795)
*Yi Hu,Zheyuan Cheng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework combining generative modeling, sliding window processing, and decision fusion for robust detection and classification of power system events using synchrophasor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance power system event detection and classification by overcoming limitations from small labeled datasets and adapting to rare or unseen disturbances.

Method: The framework uses a variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN) to model normal conditions, slides data through windows for spatiotemporal matrices, and employs decision fusion and rule-based strategies for anomaly detection.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy compared to existing machine learning and deep learning approaches, while effectively identifying both known and previously unseen events.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses the limitations of supervised methods, demonstrating adaptability and high practical value for wide-area event analysis in power systems.

Abstract: Reliable detection and classification of power system events are critical for
maintaining grid stability and situational awareness. Existing approaches often
depend on limited labeled datasets, which restricts their ability to generalize
to rare or unseen disturbances. This paper proposes a novel framework that
integrates generative modeling, sliding-window temporal processing, and
decision fusion to achieve robust event detection and classification using
synchrophasor data. A variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network is
employed to model normal operating conditions, where both reconstruction error
and discriminator error are extracted as anomaly indicators. Two complementary
decision strategies are developed: a threshold-based rule for computational
efficiency and a convex hull-based method for robustness under complex error
distributions. These features are organized into spatiotemporal detection and
classification matrices through a sliding-window mechanism, and an
identification and decision fusion stage integrates the outputs across PMUs.
This design enables the framework to identify known events while systematically
classifying previously unseen disturbances into a new category, addressing a
key limitation of supervised classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art accuracy, surpassing machine learning, deep learning, and
envelope-based baselines. The ability to recognize unknown events further
highlights the adaptability and practical value of the proposed approach for
wide-area event analysis in modern power systems.

### [1304] [Scalable Wi-Fi RSS-Based Indoor Localization via Automatic Vision-Assisted Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22869)
*Abdulkadir Bilge,Erdem Ergen,Burak Soner,Sinem Coleri*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes a lightweight, privacy-preserving Wi-Fi positioning framework using camera-assisted RSS data collection and automated training of localization algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wi-Fi-based positioning in indoor settings faces challenges due to RSS variability and the high cost of obtaining labeled data for supervised learning methods.

Method: A framework automates data collection by using an overhead camera calibrated with ArUco markers, eliminating the need for continuous video monitoring. The synchronized (x, y, RSS) data is then used to train Wi-Fi localization algorithms.

Result: The approach demonstrated improved positioning accuracy and generalization across different signal conditions and device types. Experimental results validated the effectiveness of the vision-assisted data collection process.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective and practical for Wi-Fi-based indoor positioning, and all related tools and datasets are made open source for further research.

Abstract: Wi-Fi-based positioning promises a scalable and privacy-preserving solution
for location-based services in indoor environments such as malls, airports, and
campuses. RSS-based methods are widely deployable as RSS data is available on
all Wi-Fi-capable devices, but RSS is highly sensitive to multipath, channel
variations, and receiver characteristics. While supervised learning methods
offer improved robustness, they require large amounts of labeled data, which is
often costly to obtain. We introduce a lightweight framework that solves this
by automating high-resolution synchronized RSS-location data collection using a
short, camera-assisted calibration phase. An overhead camera is calibrated only
once with ArUco markers and then tracks a device collecting RSS data from
broadcast packets of nearby access points across Wi-Fi channels. The resulting
(x, y, RSS) dataset is used to automatically train mobile-deployable
localization algorithms, avoiding the privacy concerns of continuous video
monitoring. We quantify the accuracy limits of such vision-assisted RSS data
collection under key factors such as tracking precision and label
synchronization. Using the collected experimental data, we benchmark
traditional and supervised learning approaches under varying signal conditions
and device types, demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization,
validating the utility of the proposed framework for practical use. All code,
tools, and datasets are released as open source.

*Runze Dong,Buhong Wang,Cunqian Feng,Jiang Weng,Chen Han,Jiwei Tian*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper presents a secure and efficient ISAC framework for multi-UAV networks, optimizing hybrid beamforming, artificial noise injection, and UAV trajectories to maximize the sum secrecy rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gaps in treating UAVs as ISAC users and using large-scale antenna arrays for security and spectral efficiency, critical for applications like smart cities and autonomous systems.

Method: A two-stage optimization approach is developed: Proximal Policy Optimization optimizes digital beamformers and UAV trajectories in the first stage, and matrix factorization decomposes the digital solution into analog and digital components in the second stage.

Result: Simulation results indicate that the proposed framework surpasses benchmark schemes in effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed ISAC framework successfully enhances security and spectral efficiency in multi-UAV networks, demonstrating its potential for next-gen applications.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) emerges as a key enabler for
next-generation applications such as smart cities and autonomous systems. Its
integration with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) unlocks new potentials for
reliable communication and precise sensing in dynamic aerial environments.
However, existing research predominantly treats UAVs as aerial base stations,
overlooking their role as ISAC users, and fails to leverage large-scale antenna
arrays at terrestrial base stations to enhance security and spectral
efficiency. This paper propose a secure and spectral efficient ISAC framework
for multi-UAV networks, and a two-stage optimization approach is developed to
jointly design hybrid beamforming (HBF), artificial noise (AN) injection, and
UAV trajectories. Aiming at maximizing the sum secrecy rate, the first stage
employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize digital beamformers and
trajectories, and the second stage decomposes the digital solution into analog
and digital components via low-complexity matrix factorization. Simulation
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to
benchmark schemes.

*Jianheng Zhou,Chenyu Liu,Jinan Zhou,Yi Ding,Yang Liu,Haoran Luo,Ziyu Jia,Xinliang Zhou*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A new method for sleep staging converts raw PSG signals into images for use with general-purpose models, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sleep staging methods rely on complex signals and specialized models requiring large datasets, which are not intuitive or widely adaptable.

Method: Raw one-dimensional PSG time-series are transformed into two-dimensional waveform images, and a general-purpose multimodal model is fine-tuned using these images.

Result: The method shows strong staging abilities on public datasets, mimicking human diagnostic workflows, and achieves superior accuracy compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is efficient and robust, offering a practical solution for medical sleep staging applications with plans to release its pipeline and dataset.

Abstract: Sleep staging is essential for diagnosing sleep disorders and assessing
neurological health. Existing automatic methods typically extract features from
complex polysomnography (PSG) signals and train domain-specific models, which
often lack intuitiveness and require large, specialized datasets. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm for sleep staging that leverages
large multimodal general-purpose models to emulate clinical diagnostic
practices. Specifically, we convert raw one-dimensional PSG time-series into
intuitive two-dimensional waveform images and then fine-tune a multimodal large
model to learn from these representations. Experiments on three public datasets
(ISRUC, MASS, SHHS) demonstrate that our approach enables general-purpose
models, without prior exposure to sleep data, to acquire robust staging
capabilities. Moreover, explanation analysis reveals our model learned to mimic
the visual diagnostic workflow of human experts for sleep staging by PSG
images. The proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in accuracy and robustness, highlighting its efficiency and practical value for
medical applications. The code for the signal-to-image pipeline and the PSG
image dataset will be released.

### [1307] [Uni-NTFM: A Unified Foundation Model for EEG Signal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24222)
*Zhisheng Chen,Yingwei Zhang,Qizhen Lan,Tianyu Liu,Huacan Wang,Yi Ding,Ziyu Jia,Ronghao Chen,Kun Wang,Xinliang Zhou*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces Uni-NTFM, a foundation model for EEG data that addresses limitations of prior models by using neuroscience-inspired designs, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models struggle with EEG data due to unique signal properties, including time-frequency features, spatial electrode topology, and complexity in brain-specific patterns, necessitating a specialized approach.

Method: The proposed Uni-NTFM features a decoupled architecture for separate time, frequency, and raw signal processing, a topological embedding for electrode standard unification, and a Mixture-of-Experts neural Transformer for efficient processing.

Result: Uni-NTFM$_{large}$, with 1.9 billion parameters, trained on 28,000 hours of EEG data, outperformed existing methods on nine downstream tasks, showcasing its ability to capture universal and interpretable brain representations.

Conclusion: Uni-NTFM resolves the challenges of modeling EEG data and demonstrates its superiority with neuroscience-driven innovations, contributing significantly to universal brain representation learning.

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on various and unlabeled data have demonstrated
significant success in natural language and vision, but their application to
electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenged due to the signal's unique
properties. Existing brain foundation models that inherit architectures
designed for text or images lead to three limitations in pre-training: 1)
conflating time-domain waveform patterns with frequency-domain rhythmic
features in a single processing stream, 2) ignoring the critical spatial
topology of electrodes with different standards, and 3) reliance on the
inflexible, dense network to process functionally distinct EEG patterns. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Unified Neural Topological
Foundation Model (Uni-NTFM), which is designed based on neuroscience principles
to produce universal and interpretable representations. Uni-NTFM integrates
three core innovations: 1) a decoupled architecture parallelly encodes time,
frequency, and raw signal representations before performing cross-domain
feature integration; 2) a topological embedding mechanism to unify electrodes
from different international standards and generate structured input sequences
for brain regions; and 3) a Mixture-of-Experts neural Transformer that
efficiently scales model capacity by routing signal patterns to specialized
subnetworks. The largest model, Uni-NTFM$_{large}$, has a record-breaking 1.9B
parameters and was pretrained on over 28,000 hours of diverse EEG data via a
dual-domain masked reconstruction objective. Uni-NTFM significantly outperforms
existing task-specific methods and foundation models across nine distinct
downstream tasks under both linear probing and fine-tuning settings,
demonstrating a superior ability to learn universal representations of brain
activity.

*Andriy Enttsel,Alex Marchioni,Andrea Zanellini,Mauro Mangia,Gianluca Setti,Riccardo Rovatti*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper explores a balance between compression effectiveness, distortion levels, and distinguishability of signals in an anomaly detection framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve anomaly detection in compressed data while accounting for the trade-offs in compression effectiveness, distortion, and distinguishability.

Method: The authors extend an information-theoretic framework, introducing a Gaussian model to navigate the trade-offs using a Pareto surface.

Result: Curves are produced that illustrate how the Pareto surface offers improved administration of the trade-offs compared to traditional rate-distortion strategies.

Conclusion: Leveraging the Pareto surface provides better control over the trade-offs in monitoring systems relying on compressed data.

Abstract: Extensive monitoring systems generate data that is usually compressed for
network transmission. This compressed data might then be processed in the cloud
for tasks such as anomaly detection. However, compression can potentially
impair the detector's ability to distinguish between regular and irregular
patterns due to information loss. Here we extend the information-theoretic
framework introduced in [1] to simultaneously address the trade-off between the
three features on which the effectiveness of the system depends: the
effectiveness of compression, the amount of distortion it introduces, and the
distinguishability between compressed normal signals and compressed anomalous
signals. We leverage a Gaussian assumption to draw curves showing how moving on
a Pareto surface helps administer such a trade-off better than simply relying
on optimal rate-distortion compression and hoping that compressed signals can
be distinguished from each other.

*Kunyu Wu,Qiushi Zhao,Zihan Feng,Yunxi Mu,Hao Qin,Xinyu Zhang,Xingqi Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning framework for optimizing access point placements in railway tunnels to enhance CBTC system performance, demonstrating improvements over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing AP placements in tunnels is crucial for maintaining robust wireless communication in CBTC systems, but traditional and machine learning methods face limitations.

Method: The paper integrates parabolic wave equation channel modeling, cGAN-based data augmentation, and a dueling deep Q network for AP placement optimization.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms traditional methods in terms of signal power, coverage, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The integration of electromagnetic simulation, generative modeling, and AI optimization presents a scalable solution for CBTC systems in complex environments.

Abstract: Urban railway systems increasingly rely on communication based train control
(CBTC) systems, where optimal deployment of access points (APs) in tunnels is
critical for robust wireless coverage. Traditional methods, such as empirical
model-based optimization algorithms, are hindered by excessive measurement
requirements and suboptimal solutions, while machine learning (ML) approaches
often struggle with complex tunnel environments. This paper proposes a deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) driven framework that integrates parabolic wave
equation (PWE) channel modeling, conditional generative adversarial network
(cGAN) based data augmentation, and a dueling deep Q network (Dueling DQN) for
AP placement optimization. The PWE method generates high-fidelity path loss
distributions for a subset of AP positions, which are then expanded by the cGAN
to create high resolution path loss maps for all candidate positions,
significantly reducing simulation costs while maintaining physical accuracy. In
the DRL framework, the state space captures AP positions and coverage, the
action space defines AP adjustments, and the reward function encourages signal
improvement while penalizing deployment costs. The dueling DQN enhances
convergence speed and exploration exploitation balance, increasing the
likelihood of reaching optimal configurations. Comparative experiments show
that the proposed method outperforms a conventional Hooke Jeeves optimizer and
traditional DQN, delivering AP configurations with higher average received
power, better worst-case coverage, and improved computational efficiency. This
work integrates high-fidelity electromagnetic simulation, generative modeling,
and AI-driven optimization, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution for
next-generation CBTC systems in complex tunnel environments.

*M A Al-Masud,Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz,Nils Strodthoff*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper evaluates eight ECG foundation models across 26 clinical tasks using 12 datasets and reveals mixed performance for these models in ECG interpretation, with promising results in certain domains but substantial limitations in others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the fragmentation in machine learning for ECG interpretation and evaluate how well foundation models generalize across diverse ECG tasks, exploring their utility and limitations.

Method: The researchers benchmarked eight foundation models for ECG interpretation on 26 clinical tasks using 12 public datasets, analyzing performance under both fine-tuning and frozen settings, and examined scaling behaviors with dataset sizes.

Result: The models showed heterogeneous performance: foundation models generally excelled in adult ECG interpretation but fell short in other areas like outcome prediction and patient characterization. ECG-CPC emerged as a resource-efficient standout in specific domains.

Conclusion: Foundation models hold promise for certain ECG analysis tasks but face significant limitations in broader cardiac applications, highlighting the need for future work to enhance their adaptability and clinical relevance.

Abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a long-standing diagnostic tool. Yet
machine learning for ECG interpretation remains fragmented, often limited to
narrow tasks or datasets. Foundation models promise broader adaptability, but
their generalization across diverse ECG tasks is not well understood. We
benchmarked eight ECG foundation models on 26 clinically relevant tasks using
12 public datasets comprising 1,650 regression and classification targets.
Models were evaluated under fine-tuning and frozen settings, with scaling
analyses across dataset sizes. Results show heterogeneous performance across
domains: in the most widely studied domain, adult ECG interpretation, three
foundation models consistently outperformed strong supervised baselines. In
contrast, ECG-CPC, a compact structured state-space model pretrained on HEEDB,
dominated other categories where most foundation models failed to surpass
supervised learning. Foundation models also displayed distinct scaling
behaviors with dataset size, which are critical for small-scale clinical
applications. Overall, while foundation models show promise for adult ECG
analysis, substantial gaps remain in cardiac structure, outcome prediction, and
patient characterization. Notably, ECG-CPC's strong performance despite being
orders of magnitude smaller and consuming minimal computational resources
highlights untapped opportunities for advancing ECG foundation models.

### [1311] [Bridging the behavior-neural gap: A multimodal AI reveals the brain's geometry of emotion more accurately than human self-reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24298)
*Changde Du,Yizhuo Lu,Zhongyu Huang,Yi Sun,Zisen Zhou,Shaozheng Qin,Huiguang He*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper explores whether AI models can bridge the gap between subjective emotion self-reports and their neural representation by analyzing affective dimensions of emotion using multimodal and language-based embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the 'behavior-neural gap', caused by the limitations of traditional human self-reporting scales for emotion, which struggle to predict brain activity accurately.

Method: AI models (both MLLM and LLM) provided millions of triplet odd-one-out judgments for 2,180 emotionally evocative videos. Emergent 30-dimensional embeddings were analyzed for interpretability and neural prediction capability.

Result: MLLM's embeddings successfully predicted neural activity in human emotion-processing networks more accurately than LLM embeddings and even human-derived behavioral ratings.

Conclusion: Sensory grounding, achieved with rich visual data, is critical for developing neurally-aligned conceptual frameworks for emotion. MLLM shows autonomous capability in generating these representations, bridging subjective experience and neural substrates.

Abstract: The ability to represent emotion plays a significant role in human cognition
and social interaction, yet the high-dimensional geometry of this affective
space and its neural underpinnings remain debated. A key challenge, the
`behavior-neural gap,' is the limited ability of human self-reports to predict
brain activity. Here we test the hypothesis that this gap arises from the
constraints of traditional rating scales and that large-scale similarity
judgments can more faithfully capture the brain's affective geometry. Using AI
models as `cognitive agents,' we collected millions of triplet odd-one-out
judgments from a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and a language-only
model (LLM) in response to 2,180 emotionally evocative videos. We found that
the emergent 30-dimensional embeddings from these models are highly
interpretable and organize emotion primarily along categorical lines, yet in a
blended fashion that incorporates dimensional properties. Most remarkably, the
MLLM's representation predicted neural activity in human emotion-processing
networks with the highest accuracy, outperforming not only the LLM but also,
counterintuitively, representations derived directly from human behavioral
ratings. This result supports our primary hypothesis and suggests that sensory
grounding--learning from rich visual data--is critical for developing a truly
neurally-aligned conceptual framework for emotion. Our findings provide
compelling evidence that MLLMs can autonomously develop rich, neurally-aligned
affective representations, offering a powerful paradigm to bridge the gap
between subjective experience and its neural substrates. Project page:

*Rukhshan Haroon,Kyle Wigdor,Katie Yang,Nicole Toumanios,Eileen T. Crehan,Fahad Dogar*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeuroBridge, an AI-powered platform leveraging large language models (LLMs) to improve understanding of autistic communication styles among neurotypical individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autistic individuals often face communication challenges with neurotypical peers due to differing communication styles and the undue expectation to conform to neurotypical norms.

Method: The authors utilized LLMs to create an AI character mimicking direct and literal autistic communication, integrated into a feedback-driven platform to simulate cross-neurotype interactions.

Result: In a study with 12 neurotypical participants, NeuroBridge enhanced understanding of autistic communication, eliciting positive feedback on its interactive approach and constructive AI feedback.

Conclusion: NeuroBridge demonstrates potential for improving neurotypical understanding of autism, but future efforts must address personalization and limitations in modeling intricate social dynamics.

Abstract: Communication challenges between autistic and neurotypical individuals stem
from a mutual lack of understanding of each other's distinct, and often
contrasting, communication styles. Yet, autistic individuals are expected to
adapt to neurotypical norms, making interactions inauthentic and mentally
exhausting for them. To help redress this imbalance, we build NeuroBridge, an
online platform that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to simulate: (a) an
AI character that is direct and literal, a style common among many autistic
individuals, and (b) four cross-neurotype communication scenarios in a
feedback-driven conversation between this character and a neurotypical user.
Through NeuroBridge, neurotypical individuals gain a firsthand look at autistic
communication, and reflect on their role in shaping cross-neurotype
interactions. In a user study with 12 neurotypical participants, we find that
NeuroBridge improved their understanding of how autistic people may interpret
language differently, with all describing autism as a social difference that
"needs understanding by others" after completing the simulation. Participants
valued its personalized, interactive format and described AI-generated feedback
as "constructive", "logical" and "non-judgmental". Most perceived the portrayal
of autism in the simulation as accurate, suggesting that users may readily
accept AI-generated (mis)representations of disabilities. To conclude, we
discuss design implications for disability representation in AI, the need for
making NeuroBridge more personalized, and LLMs' limitations in modeling complex
social scenarios.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Privy,' a tool designed to help AI practitioners assess privacy risks and propose mitigations, with an LLM-powered version showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners in AI face challenges in identifying and mitigating privacy risks due to a lack of effective resources and structured methodologies.

Method: Researchers developed Privy, informed by a study involving 11 practitioners, and tested two versions—LLM-powered and template-based—through a controlled study with 24 practitioners, whose results were evaluated by 13 privacy experts.

Result: Privy enabled practitioners to produce high-quality privacy assessments by effectively identifying relevant risks and appropriate mitigation strategies. The LLM-powered version showed enhanced effectiveness.

Conclusion: Privy addresses key barriers in privacy work for AI practitioners, offering a user-friendly tool that improves awareness, motivation, and ability to assess and mitigate privacy risks.

Abstract: AI creates and exacerbates privacy risks, yet practitioners lack effective
resources to identify and mitigate these risks. We present Privy, a tool that
guides practitioners through structured privacy impact assessments to: (i)
identify relevant risks in novel AI product concepts, and (ii) propose
appropriate mitigations. Privy was shaped by a formative study with 11
practitioners, which informed two versions -- one LLM-powered, the other
template-based. We evaluated these two versions of Privy through a
between-subjects, controlled study with 24 separate practitioners, whose
assessments were reviewed by 13 independent privacy experts. Results show that
Privy helps practitioners produce privacy assessments that experts deemed high
quality: practitioners identified relevant risks and proposed appropriate
mitigation strategies. These effects were augmented in the LLM-powered version.
Practitioners themselves rated Privy as being useful and usable, and their
feedback illustrates how it helps overcome long-standing awareness, motivation,
and ability barriers in privacy work.

Motivation: The paper aims to address inter-subject variability and limited labeled data in BCIs, which result in lengthy calibration phases.

Method: The authors use lightweight CNNs conditioned on subject identity, with hyperparameter optimization strategies for class imbalance and minimal calibration for new subjects.

Result: The method improves generalization and enables data-efficient calibration for ERP classification tasks, using interpretable metrics and explainable visualizations.

Conclusion: The approach enhances the scalability and practicality of BCIs by effectively adapting to individual subjects with reduced data demands.

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) suffer from high inter-subject variability

work, we present an end-to-end approach that explicitly models the subject
dependency using lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) conditioned
on the subject's identity. Our method integrates hyperparameter optimization
strategies that prioritize class imbalance and evaluates two conditioning
mechanisms to adapt pre-trained models to unseen subjects with minimal
calibration data. We benchmark three lightweight architectures on a
time-modulated Event-Related Potentials (ERP) classification task, providing
interpretable evaluation metrics and explainable visualizations of the learned
representations. Results demonstrate improved generalization and data-efficient
calibration, highlighting the scalability and practicality of subject-adaptive
BCIs.

Motivation: The authors aim to bridge psychology, art, and computational modeling to better understand and support visual creativity.

Method: Using artist interviews, psychological theories, 20k artworks from the SemArt dataset, and GPT 4.1-generated annotations integrated with CLIP embeddings for trait evaluation.

Result: Some traits (e.g., Environmental Dialogicity) can be well-predicted ($R^2 \approx 0.64-0.68$), while others (e.g., Memory Imprint) are challenging.

Conclusion: The study provides interpretable tools for trait-aware creativity exploration, emphasizing collaboration between artists, researchers, and AI systems rather than oversimplifying creativity.

Abstract: We introduce a psychologically grounded and artist-informed framework for
modeling visual creativity across four domains: Inner, Outer, Imaginative, and
Moral Worlds. Drawing on interviews with practicing artists and theories from
psychology, we define 12 traits that capture affective, symbolic, cultural, and
ethical dimensions of creativity.Using 20k artworks from the SemArt dataset, we
annotate images with GPT 4.1 using detailed, theory-aligned prompts, and
evaluate the learnability of these traits from CLIP image embeddings. Traits
such as Environmental Dialogicity and Redemptive Arc are predicted with high
reliability ($R^2 \approx 0.64 - 0.68$), while others like Memory Imprint
remain challenging, highlighting the limits of purely visual encoding. Beyond
technical metrics, we visualize a "creativity trait-space" and illustrate how
it can support interpretable, trait-aware co-creation - e.g., sliding along a
Redemptive Arc axis to explore works of adversity and renewal. By linking
cultural-aesthetic insights with computational modeling, our work aims not to
reduce creativity to numbers, but to offer shared language and interpretable
tools for artists, researchers, and AI systems to collaborate meaningfully.

### [1316] [Understanding Cognitive States from Head & Hand Motion Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24255)
*Kaiang Wen,Mark Roman Miller*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores how head and hand motion data from VR systems can reveal nuanced cognitive states like confusion and hesitation. Researchers introduced a novel annotated dataset, and deep models demonstrated human-like accuracy in decoding these states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to probe how motion kinematics from VR telemetry reflect subtle cognitive states that lack obvious motion correlates.

Method: The researchers created a dataset with head and hand motion telemetry paired with frame-level annotations of cognitive states and employed deep temporal models to analyze these patterns.

Result: Deep temporal models successfully identified cognitive states such as confusion and readiness, achieving accuracy comparable to human observers.

Conclusion: VR telemetry can reveal cognitive states, enabling adaptive virtual environments. The dataset and framework will be publicly shared for further research.

Abstract: As virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) continue to gain
popularity, head and hand motion data captured by consumer VR systems have
become ubiquitous. Prior work shows that such telemetry can be highly
identifying and reflect broad user traits, often aligning with intuitive "folk
theories" of body language. However, it remains unclear to what extent motion
kinematics encode more nuanced cognitive states, such as confusion, hesitation,
and readiness, which lack clear correlates with motion. To investigate this, we
introduce a novel dataset of head and hand motion with frame-level annotations
of these states collected during structured decision-making tasks. Our findings
suggest that deep temporal models can infer subtle cognitive states from motion
alone, achieving comparable performance with human observers. This work
demonstrates that standard VR telemetry contains strong patterns related to
users' internal cognitive processes, which opens the door for a new generation
of adaptive virtual environments. To enhance reproducibility and support future
work, we will make our dataset and modeling framework publicly available.

### [1317] [Cognition Engines: A Row-Scale HVDC Architecture for Computational Continuity of AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22680)
*Paul Churnock*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: The paper presents a new ±400 Vdc architecture to address synchronized energy surges during AI training, offering fast response, bounded power exchange, high efficiency, and seamless scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate destabilizing, step-dominant power surges caused by AI training's energy demands, which challenge constant-power loads and grid stability.

Method: The authors propose a ±400 Vdc architecture featuring fast-reacting DRUs, regulated SSTs, bounded power ramping, and explicit energy contracts (e.g., minimal deviation and recovery standards). Protection is hierarchically time-graded, while scaling aims to preserve operational invariants without re-tuning higher-level infrastructures.

Result: The proposed architecture ensures steady power continuity, avoids reverse power and high-frequency instability, adheres to explicit performance contracts, and scales seamlessly from row to campus level.

Conclusion: By anchoring the architecture to physics and well-defined performance contracts, the system effectively balances AI training surges while ensuring reliable grid integration, facilitating scalable and robust energy management.

Abstract: AI training creates synchronized, step-dominant surges with millisecond edges
that destabilize constant-power loads (Choukse et al., 2025; arXiv:2508.14318).
We propose a physics-anchored row-scale $\pm 400$ Vdc architecture that makes
Computational Continuity a structural property. DRUs supply fast energy via
controlled droop; SSTs regulate average power with bounded ramps and no reverse
power flow and no high-frequency export at the PCC; import is subjected to a
bounded dP/dt envelope; film capacitance and clamps absorb the first edge. The
contract is explicit: $\pm 1\%$ steady-band, $\leq 2\%$ transient deviation,
$\leq 3$ ms recovery, $\geq 45^{\circ}$ margin, reserve floors intact, yields
spine and lowest branches. Recharge is valley-following (admitted only below
Avg with MW headroom; $\leq 5$ kW/s per row ramps). Protection is time-graded
(branch $\mu$s, row ms, MW seconds). Scaling preserves invariants from row to
pod/hall/campus without retuning. Conformance is by waveform evidence
(microsecond branch clears, $2\%/50$ ms holds, FLISR with no reverse power flow
and no high-frequency export at the PCC). The result is not tuning but a
contract for continuity.

### [1318] [Length-Matching Routing for Programmable Photonic Circuits Using Best-First Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23463)
*Xiaoke Wang,Dirk Stroobandt*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: The paper proposes advanced routing strategies for programmable photonic integrated circuits (PICs), focusing on precise wire length matching instead of shortest-path routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photonic components like optical ring resonators and Mach-Zehnder interferometers require exact-length routing to preserve optical properties, which conventional routing algorithms fail to address.

Method: The authors introduce length-matching routing strategies, using modified Best-First search algorithms with a novel heuristic estimator and pruning mechanism. For multi-pin routing, a detour margin-based pin-ordering method is developed.

Result: Evaluations on benchmarks demonstrate the runtime efficiency and improved heuristic accuracy of the proposed methods across diverse layout scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms successfully address the challenges of exact-length routing in PICs, ensuring improved performance and feasibility within different circuit layouts.

Abstract: In the realm of programmable photonic integrated circuits (PICs), precise
wire length control is crucial for the performance of on-chip programmable
components such as optical ring resonators, Mach-Zehnder interferometers, and
optical true time-delay lines. Unlike conventional routing algorithms that
prioritize shortest-path solutions, these photonic components require
exact-length routing to maintain the desired optical properties.
  To address these challenges, this paper presents different length-matching
routing strategies to find exact-length paths while balancing search space and
runtime efficiently. We propose a novel admissible heuristic estimator and a
pruning method, designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the search
process. The algorithms are derived from the Best-First search with modified
evaluation functions. For two-pin length-matching routing, we formally prove
that the proposed algorithms are complete under monotonic heuristics. For
multi-pin length-matching challenges, we introduce a pin-ordering mechanism
based on detour margins to reduce the likelihood of prematurely blocking
feasible routes. Through evaluations on various length-matching benchmarks, we
analyze runtime and heuristic performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of
the proposed approaches across different layout scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To offer a low-power, real-time detection system using natural plant signals as environmental indicators.

Method: Utilization of Hedera helix plant's electric signals, processed on the PhytoNode low-power platform, with onboard embedded deep learning models.

Result: Achieved sensitivity up to 0.98 in detecting temperature and ozone changes, and identified areas of improvement like variability mitigation with expanded training data.

Conclusion: This novel biological sensor system demonstrates strong potential for scalable, continuous environmental monitoring and applications in other fields.

Abstract: We present a bio-hybrid environmental sensor system that integrates natural
plants and embedded deep learning for real-time, on-device detection of
temperature and ozone level changes. Our system, based on the low-power
PhytoNode platform, records electric differential potential signals from Hedera
helix and processes them onboard using an embedded deep learning model. We
demonstrate that our sensing device detects changes in temperature and ozone
with good sensitivity of up to 0.98. Daily and inter-plant variability, as well
as limited precision, could be mitigated by incorporating additional training
data, which is readily integrable in our data-driven framework. Our approach
also has potential to scale to new environmental factors and plant species. By
integrating embedded deep learning onboard our biological sensing device, we
offer a new, low-power solution for continuous environmental monitoring and
potentially other fields of application.

*Jinbae Seo,Hyeongjun Kwon,Kwonyoung Kim,Jiyoung Lee,Kwanghoon Sohn*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper proposes techniques to address limitations in audiovisual instance segmentation (AVIS), improving localization and tracking of sounding objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AVIS methods face issues like uniform additive fusion preventing queries from specializing and visual-only objectives leading to arbitrary salient object identification.

Method: The paper introduces Audio-Centric Query Generation using cross-attention for selective focus on sound sources and Sound-Aware Ordinal Counting (SAOC) loss for supervised object counting.

Result: Experiments on the AVISeg benchmark show improvements including +1.64 mAP, +0.6 HOTA, and +2.06 FSLA.

Conclusion: Specialized query mechanisms and explicit counting supervision are essential for enhancing audiovisual instance segmentation.

Abstract: Audiovisual instance segmentation (AVIS) requires accurately localizing and
tracking sounding objects throughout video sequences. Existing methods suffer
from visual bias stemming from two fundamental issues: uniform additive fusion
prevents queries from specializing to different sound sources, while
visual-only training objectives allow queries to converge to arbitrary salient
objects. We propose Audio-Centric Query Generation using cross-attention,
enabling each query to selectively attend to distinct sound sources and carry
sound-specific priors into visual decoding. Additionally, we introduce
Sound-Aware Ordinal Counting (SAOC) loss that explicitly supervises sounding
object numbers through ordinal regression with monotonic consistency
constraints, preventing visual-only convergence during training. Experiments on
AVISeg benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements: +1.64 mAP, +0.6 HOTA, and
+2.06 FSLA, validating that query specialization and explicit counting
supervision are crucial for accurate audiovisual instance segmentation.

### [1321] [Index-MSR: A high-efficiency multimodal fusion framework for speech recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22744)
*Jinming Chen,Lu Wang,Zheshu Song,Wei Deng*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces Index-MSR, a framework employing multimodal inputs of video-related text to improve speech recognition, achieving reductions in errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in speech recognition for domain-specific terminology and short utterances that lack semantic coherence, and where performance is typically poor.

Method: The authors developed a Multimodal Fusion Decoder (MFD) within the Index-MSR framework that integrates video text cues (e.g., subtitles and presentation slides) to enhance speech recognition.

Result: Extensive evaluation demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy, with substitution errors reduced by up to 50% on both in-house and public datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating video-derived text cues enables more accurate speech recognition and presents strong potential for applications requiring precise synchronization, such as audio translation.

Abstract: Driven by large scale datasets and LLM based architectures, automatic speech
recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable improvements in accuracy.
However, challenges persist for domain-specific terminology, and short
utterances lacking semantic coherence, where recognition performance often
degrades significantly. In this work, we present Index-MSR, an efficient
multimodal speech recognition framework. At its core is a novel Multimodal
Fusion Decoder (MFD), which effectively incorporates text-related information
from videos (e.g., subtitles and presentation slides) into the speech
recognition. This cross-modal integration not only enhances overall ASR
accuracy but also yields substantial reductions in substitution errors.
Extensive evaluations on both an in-house subtitle dataset and a public AVSR
dataset demonstrate that Index-MSR achieves sota accuracy, with substitution
errors reduced by 20,50%. These results demonstrate that our approach
efficiently exploits text-related cues from video to improve speech recognition
accuracy, showing strong potential in applications requiring strict audio text
synchronization, such as audio translation.

*Dominik Klement,Matthew Maciejewski,Sanjeev Khudanpur,Jan Černocký,Lukáš Burget*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel unsupervised speech enhancement model using a dual-branch encoder-decoder architecture and adversarial training, achieving comparable results to existing methods while highlighting data selection biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Paired clean-noisy speech data are challenging to collect in real-world conditions, forcing reliance on synthetic data and creating a gap between training and testing phases.

Method: The authors use a dual-branch encoder-decoder architecture to separate clean speech and residual noise, employing adversarial training with unpaired datasets for priors.

Result: Experimental results show comparable performance to leading unsupervised approaches and emphasize the importance of clean speech data selection.

Conclusion: Their findings disclose potential biases when using in-domain clean speech for prior definition, suggesting caution in future studies to avoid overly optimistic results.

Abstract: The majority of deep learning-based speech enhancement methods require paired
clean-noisy speech data. Collecting such data at scale in real-world conditions
is infeasible, which has led the community to rely on synthetically generated
noisy speech. However, this introduces a gap between the training and testing
phases. In this work, we propose a novel dual-branch encoder-decoder
architecture for unsupervised speech enhancement that separates the input into
clean speech and residual noise. Adversarial training is employed to impose
priors on each branch, defined by unpaired datasets of clean speech and,
optionally, noise. Experimental results show that our method achieves
performance comparable to leading unsupervised speech enhancement approaches.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the critical impact of clean speech data selection
on enhancement performance. In particular, our findings reveal that performance
may appear overly optimistic when in-domain clean speech data are used for
prior definition -- a practice adopted in previous unsupervised speech
enhancement studies.

### [1323] [VSSFlow: Unifying Video-conditioned Sound and Speech Generation via Joint Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24773)
*Xin Cheng,Yuyue Wang,Xihua Wang,Yihan Wu,Kaisi Guan,Yijing Chen,Peng Zhang,Xiaojiang Liu,Meng Cao,Ruihua Song*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: VSSFlow is a unified model for video-conditioned sound and speech generation, effectively addressing both video-to-sound and visual text-to-speech tasks through a novel flow-matching framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat video-to-sound and visual text-to-speech tasks separately, facing challenges in integrating them into a unified framework due to differences in condition types and complex training requirements.

Method: VSSFlow introduces a unified flow-matching framework with a condition aggregation mechanism, leveraging cross-attention for video conditions and self-attention for transcript conditions.

Result: Through end-to-end joint learning, VSSFlow achieves faster convergence, improved conditional generation, and stabilization in the classifier-free guidance process. It outperforms domain-specific models on benchmarks.

Conclusion: VSSFlow successfully integrates V2S and VisualTTS tasks, demonstrating unified generative models' potential to set new standards in these areas.

Abstract: Video-conditioned sound and speech generation, encompassing video-to-sound
(V2S) and visual text-to-speech (VisualTTS) tasks, are conventionally addressed
as separate tasks, with limited exploration to unify them within a signle
framework. Recent attempts to unify V2S and VisualTTS face challenges in
handling distinct condition types (e.g., heterogeneous video and transcript
conditions) and require complex training stages. Unifying these two tasks
remains an open problem. To bridge this gap, we present VSSFlow, which
seamlessly integrates both V2S and VisualTTS tasks into a unified flow-matching
framework. VSSFlow uses a novel condition aggregation mechanism to handle
distinct input signals. We find that cross-attention and self-attention layer
exhibit different inductive biases in the process of introducing condition.
Therefore, VSSFlow leverages these inductive biases to effectively handle
different representations: cross-attention for ambiguous video conditions and
self-attention for more deterministic speech transcripts. Furthermore, contrary
to the prevailing belief that joint training on the two tasks requires complex
training strategies and may degrade performance, we find that VSSFlow benefits
from the end-to-end joint learning process for sound and speech generation
without extra designs on training stages. Detailed analysis attributes it to
the learned general audio prior shared between tasks, which accelerates
convergence, enhances conditional generation, and stabilizes the
classifier-free guidance process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VSSFlow surpasses the state-of-the-art domain-specific baselines on both V2S
and VisualTTS benchmarks, underscoring the critical potential of unified
generative models.

*Md. Saiful Bari Siddiqui,Utsab Saha*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper proposes AudioFuse, a method combining spectral and temporal representations for improved PCG classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome compromises in temporal precision and phase information in traditional spectrogram-based models and improve classification performance for biomedical audio signals.

Method: AudioFuse integrates a custom Vision Transformer (ViT) for spectrograms and a shallow 1D CNN for raw waveforms, specifically designed to mitigate overfitting.

Result: AudioFuse achieved an ROC-AUC of 0.8608 on the PhysioNet 2016 dataset, outperforming individual model baselines. It also demonstrated robustness to domain shifts on the PASCAL dataset.

Conclusion: Fusing spectral and temporal representations enhances classification performance and robustness, enabling reliable and generalizable classifiers without requiring large-scale pre-training.

Abstract: Biomedical audio signals, such as phonocardiograms (PCG), are inherently
rhythmic and contain diagnostic information in both their spectral (tonal) and
temporal domains. Standard 2D spectrograms provide rich spectral features but
compromise the phase information and temporal precision of the 1D waveform. We
propose AudioFuse, an architecture that simultaneously learns from both
complementary representations to classify PCGs. To mitigate the overfitting
risk common in fusion models, we integrate a custom, wide-and-shallow Vision
Transformer (ViT) for spectrograms with a shallow 1D CNN for raw waveforms. On
the PhysioNet 2016 dataset, AudioFuse achieves a state-of-the-art competitive
ROC-AUC of 0.8608 when trained from scratch, outperforming its spectrogram
(0.8066) and waveform (0.8223) baselines. Moreover, it demonstrates superior
robustness to domain shift on the challenging PASCAL dataset, maintaining an
ROC-AUC of 0.7181 while the spectrogram baseline collapses (0.4873). Fusing
complementary representations thus provides a strong inductive bias, enabling
the creation of efficient, generalizable classifiers without requiring
large-scale pre-training.

Motivation: To address the lack of large-scale datasets for Chinese Mandarin audio-visual whisper speech recognition and improve privacy and discrete communication capabilities.

Method: A new dataset, AISHELL6-Whisper, featuring 30 hours of synchronized whisper and normal speech with video, was developed, paired with an AVSR baseline based on the Whisper-Flamingo framework with innovations in training strategies and spectral alignment adjustments.

Result: The proposed model achieved a Character Error Rate (CER) of 4.13% for whisper speech and 1.11% for normal speech on the test set, and set state-of-the-art results on the wTIMIT benchmark.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust dataset and baseline model, setting new benchmarks in whisper speech recognition and facilitating further advancements in this field, with all resources being openly accessible.

Abstract: Whisper speech recognition is crucial not only for ensuring privacy in
sensitive communications but also for providing a critical communication bridge
for patients under vocal restraint and enabling discrete interaction in
noise-sensitive environments. The development of Chinese mandarin audio-visual
whisper speech recognition is hindered by the lack of large-scale datasets. We
present AISHELL6-Whisper, a large-scale open-source audio-visual whisper speech
dataset, featuring 30 hours each of whisper speech and parallel normal speech,
with synchronized frontal facial videos. Moreover, we propose an audio-visual
speech recognition (AVSR) baseline based on the Whisper-Flamingo framework,
which integrates a parallel training strategy to align embeddings across speech
types, and employs a projection layer to adapt to whisper speech's spectral
properties. The model achieves a Character Error Rate (CER) of 4.13% for
whisper speech and 1.11% for normal speech in the test set of our dataset, and
establishes new state-of-the-art results on the wTIMIT benchmark. The dataset

### [1327] [Profit over Proxies: A Scalable Bayesian Decision Framework for Optimizing Multi-Variant Online Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22677)
*Srijesh Pillai,Rajesh Kumar Chandrawat*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: This paper introduces a scalable Bayesian decision framework for profit optimization in A/B/n tests, addressing issues like p-value peeking and reliance on proxy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the flaws in conventional A/B testing practices, such as inflated false positives and proxy metrics harming profitability.

Method: The paper employs a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate both conversion probability and monetary value, combined with a decision-theoretic stopping rule based on Expected Loss.

Result: The approach avoids revenue traps, terminates futile experiments early to save resources, and ensures statistical integrity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables organizations to evolve beyond simple A/B testing towards a profit-driven, strategically valuable experimentation culture.

Abstract: Online controlled experiments (A/B tests) are fundamental to data-driven
decision-making in the digital economy. However, their real-world application
is frequently compromised by two critical shortcomings: the use of
statistically flawed heuristics like "p-value peeking", which inflates false
positive rates, and an over-reliance on proxy metrics like conversion rates,
which can lead to decisions that inadvertently harm core business
profitability. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a
comprehensive and scalable Bayesian decision framework designed for profit
optimization in multi-variant (A/B/n) experiments.
  We propose a hierarchical Bayesian model that simultaneously estimates the
probability of conversion (using a Beta-Bernoulli model) and the monetary value
of that conversion (using a robust Bayesian model for the mean transaction
value). Building on this, we employ a decision-theoretic stopping rule based on
Expected Loss, enabling experiments to be concluded not only when a superior
variant is identified but also when it becomes clear that no variant offers a
practically significant improvement (stopping for futility). The framework
successfully navigates "revenue traps" where a variant with a higher conversion
rate would have resulted in a net financial loss, correctly terminates futile
experiments early to conserve resources, and maintains strict statistical
integrity throughout the monitoring process.
  Ultimately, this work provides a practical and principled methodology for
organizations to move beyond simple A/B testing towards a mature, profit-driven
experimentation culture, ensuring that statistical conclusions translate
directly to strategic business value.

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: A method called PISA is introduced for survival analysis, focused on interpretability by converting models into simple flowcharts, achieving strong results while maintaining clinical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve survival analysis in clinical research by balancing accuracy, interpretability, and risk factor identification, addressing the limitations of both traditional and modern deep learning models.

Method: Proposes PISA, a pipeline combining various survival models with multi-objective feature engineering to produce interpretable survival predictions using flowcharts as outputs.

Result: PISA demonstrated interpretable predictions and achieved state-of-the-art performance on two clinical datasets while automating survival analysis workflows.

Conclusion: PISA effectively balances performance and interpretability by translating complex survival prediction models into actionable clinical tools.

Abstract: Survival analysis is central to clinical research, informing patient
prognoses, guiding treatment decisions, and optimising resource allocation.
Accurate time-to-event predictions not only improve quality of life but also
reveal risk factors that shape clinical practice. For these models to be
relevant in healthcare, interpretability is critical: predictions must be
traceable to patient-specific characteristics, and risk factors should be
identifiable to generate actionable insights for both clinicians and
researchers. Traditional survival models often fail to capture non-linear
interactions, while modern deep learning approaches, though powerful, are
limited by poor interpretability.
  We propose a Pipeline for Interpretable Survival Analysis (PISA) - a pipeline
that provides multiple survival analysis models that trade off complexity and
performance. Using multiple-feature, multi-objective feature engineering, PISA
transforms patient characteristics and time-to-event data into multiple
survival analysis models, providing valuable insights into the survival
prediction task. Crucially, every model is converted into simple patient
stratification flowcharts supported by Kaplan-Meier curves, whilst not
compromising on performance. While PISA is model-agnostic, we illustrate its
flexibility through applications of Cox regression and shallow survival trees,
the latter avoiding proportional hazards assumptions.
  Applied to two clinical benchmark datasets, PISA produced interpretable
survival models and intuitive stratification flowcharts whilst achieving
state-of-the-art performances. Revisiting a prior departmental study further
demonstrated its capacity to automate survival analysis workflows in real-world
clinical research.

comprehensive framework for telecommunications churn prediction leveraging deep
neural networks. Through systematic problem formulation, rigorous dataset
analysis, and careful feature engineering, we develop a model that captures
complex patterns in customer behavior indicative of potential churn. We conduct
extensive empirical evaluations across multiple performance metrics,
demonstrating that our proposed neural architecture achieves significant

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the growing public health risk of WNV in the US by improving forecasting methods without a human vaccine available.

Method: Introduce a new GNN architecture with linearly connected graph attention layers, focusing on local information and utilizing a large dataset of weather, land use, and mosquito trap data.

Result: The proposed model significantly outperformed both classical methods and previous GNN architectures across diverse scenarios and prediction horizons.

Conclusion: The study provides a major enhancement in WNV forecasting capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of the novel GNN architecture combined with the large dataset.

Abstract: West Nile virus is a significant, and growing, public health issue in the
United States. With no human vaccine, mosquito control programs rely on
accurate forecasting to determine when and where WNV will emerge. Recently,
spatial Graph neural networks (GNNs) were shown to be a powerful tool for WNV
forecasting, significantly improving over traditional methods. Building on this
work, we introduce a new GNN variant that linearly connects graph attention
layers, allowing us to train much larger models than previously used for WNV
forecasting. This architecture specializes general densely connected GNNs so
that the model focuses more heavily on local information to prevent over
smoothing. To support training large GNNs we compiled a massive new dataset of
weather data, land use information, and mosquito trap results across Illinois.
Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms both GNN and
classical baselines in both out-of-sample and out-of-graph WNV prediction skill
across a variety of scenarios and over all prediction horizons.

*Josep Lumbreras*

TL;DR: The paper focuses on the trade-off between exploration and exploitation for online quantum state learning using multi-armed bandits, deriving bounds for regret and applications in tomography, recommendation systems, and thermodynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of efficiently learning properties of quantum states while minimizing measurement disturbance in real-time settings.

Method: The approach involves multi-armed bandit algorithms with theoretical bounds on regret, optimal strategies, and a sample-efficient algorithm employing a weighted least squares estimator guided by an optimistic principle.

Result: The findings include regret bounds scaling as the square root of rounds, polylogarithmic regret for specific settings, and an exponential advantage in work dissipation in thermodynamic applications compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The work proposes a novel and efficient framework for learning quantum states online, combining theoretical rigor and practical applications across various quantum systems.

Abstract: This thesis studies the exploration and exploitation trade-off in online
learning of properties of quantum states using multi-armed bandits. Given
streaming access to an unknown quantum state, in each round we select an
observable from a set of actions to maximize its expectation value. Using past
information, we refine actions to minimize regret; the cumulative gap between
current reward and the maximum possible. We derive information-theoretic lower
bounds and optimal strategies with matching upper bounds, showing regret
typically scales as the square root of rounds. As an application, we reframe
quantum state tomography to both learn the state efficiently and minimize
measurement disturbance. For pure states and continuous actions, we achieve
polylogarithmic regret using a sample-optimal algorithm based on a weighted
online least squares estimator. The algorithm relies on the optimistic
principle and controls the eigenvalues of the design matrix. We also apply our
framework to quantum recommender systems and thermodynamic work extraction from
unknown states. In this last setting, our results demonstrate an exponential
advantage in work dissipation over tomography-based protocols.

*Wei Zhou,Guoliang Li,Haoyu Wang,Yuxing Han,Xufei Wu,Fan Wu,Xuanhe Zhou*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: PARROT is a benchmark designed for Cross-System SQL Translation, covering diverse SQL dialects and challenging large language models (LLMs) with low success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-System SQL Translation is crucial for practical adaptability between various database systems but has been understudied due to limitations in existing benchmarks.

Method: The study introduces PARROT, a benchmark consisting of realistic translation pairs, diverse and simplified variants, and evaluations targeting 22 different database systems.

Result: LLMs achieved less than 38.53% average accuracy on PARROT, highlighting the challenge posed by diverse SQL dialects and system-specific syntax.

Conclusion: PARROT Benchmark fills a gap in Cross-System SQL Translation research, enabling evaluation, fostering progress, and supporting community-driven leaderboard and resources.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMS) have shown increasing effectiveness in
Text-to-SQL tasks. However, another closely related problem, Cross-System SQL
Translation (a.k.a., SQL-to-SQL), which adapts a query written for one database
system (e.g., MySQL) into its equivalent one for another system (e.g.,
ClickHouse), is of great practical importance but remains underexplored.
Existing SQL benchmarks are not well-suited for SQL-to-SQL evaluation, which
(1) focus on a limited set of database systems (often just SQLite) and (2)
cannot capture many system-specific SQL dialects (e.g., customized functions,
data types, and syntax rules). Thus, in this paper, we introduce PARROT, a
Practical And Realistic BenchmaRk for CrOss-System SQL Translation. PARROT
comprises 598 translation pairs from 38 open-source benchmarks and real-world
business services, specifically prepared to challenge system-specific SQL
understanding (e.g., LLMS achieve lower than 38.53% accuracy on average). We
also provide multiple benchmark variants, including PARROT-Diverse with 28,003
translations (for extensive syntax testing) and PARROT-Simple with 5,306
representative samples (for focused stress testing), covering 22
production-grade database systems. To promote future research, we release a
public leaderboard and source code at: https://code4db.github.io/parrot-bench/.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) assets, such as models, datasets, and metadata, are
central to modern ML workflows. Despite their explosive growth in practice,
these assets are often underutilized due to fragmented documentation, siloed
storage, inconsistent licensing, and lack of unified discovery mechanisms,
making ML-asset management an urgent challenge. This tutorial offers a
comprehensive overview of ML-asset management activities across its lifecycle,
including curation, discovery, and utilization. We provide a categorization of
ML assets, and major management issues, survey state-of-the-art techniques, and
identify emerging opportunities at each stage. We further highlight
system-level challenges related to scalability, lineage, and unified indexing.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: The paper extends an economic growth model under AGI by addressing Moravec's Paradox, focusing on expensive physical task automation and its implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the economic distribution and growth outcomes when physical tasks are computationally expensive or impossible to automate in the presence of AGI.

Method: The model introduces a partition in task space, distinguishing cognitive and physical tasks with differential automation costs, explicitly accounting for infinite costs in certain physical tasks.

Result: The study finds that with high/computationally infeasible costs for physical tasks, the labor share of income stabilizes at a positive constant, altering income distribution while maintaining cognitive economy growth.

Conclusion: Economic implications of AGI depend on task automation costs; physical task bottlenecks preserve labor's income share in finite compute scenarios.

Abstract: This note extends Restrepo (2025)'s model of economic growth under AGI by
incorporating Moravec's Paradox -the observation that tasks requiring
sensorimotor skills remain computationally expensive relative to cognitive
tasks. We partition the task space into cognitive and physical components with
differential automation costs, allowing infinite costs for some physical
bottlenecks. Our key result shows that when physical tasks constitute economic
bottlenecks with sufficiently high (or infinite) computational requirements,
the labor share of income converges to a positive constant in the
finite-compute regime (rather than zero). This fundamentally alters the
distributional implications of AGI while preserving the growth dynamics for
cognitive-intensive economies.

### [1336] [Unlicensed Band Allocation for Heterogeneous Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23216)
*Po-Heng Chou*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of interference between LAA and Wi-Fi systems in heterogeneous networks sharing unlicensed channels and proposes four allocation schemes to optimize performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize interference and optimize the quality of service (QoS) in heterogeneous networks where LAA and Wi-Fi coexist using unlicensed channels.

Method: The authors propose an analytical model and perform simulations to compare four unlicensed band allocation schemes: UFA, UTA, UFAB, and UTAB.

Result: Performance is evaluated based on the acceptance rate of LAA and Wi-Fi packet data in the LAA buffer queue, offering insights into optimizing channel occupation and buffer design.

Conclusion: The study provides design guidelines and recommendations to enhance bandwidth efficiency and QoS for LAA small cells coexisting with Wi-Fi.

Abstract: Based on the License-Assisted Access (LAA) small cell architecture, the LAA
coexisting with Wi-Fi heterogeneous networks provides LTE mobile users with
high bandwidth efficiency as the unlicensed channels are shared among LAA and
Wi-Fi. However, LAA and Wi-Fi interfere with each other when both systems use
the same unlicensed channel in heterogeneous networks. In such a network,
unlicensed band allocation for LAA and Wi-Fi is an important issue that may
affect the quality of service (QoS) of both systems significantly. In this
paper, we propose an analytical model and conduct simulation experiments to
study four allocations for the unlicensed band: unlicensed full allocation
(UFA), unlicensed time-division allocation (UTA), and UFA/UTA with buffering
mechanism (UFAB and UTAB) for the LAA data packets. We evaluate the performance
of these unlicensed band allocation schemes in terms of the acceptance rate of
both LAA and Wi-Fi packet data in the LAA buffer queue. Our study provides
guidelines for designing the channel occupation phase and the buffer size of
the LAA small cell.

Method: An analytical model combined with simulation experiments to evaluate unlicensed band allocation utilizing buffering mechanisms.

Result: The study quantified the acceptance rate of both LAA and Wi-Fi packets under different unlicensed band allocation strategies.

Conclusion: Guidelines were developed for optimizing channel occupation and buffer thresholds in LAA systems to balance performance for both systems.

Abstract: In this letter, we propose an analytical model and conduct simulation
experiments to study listen-before-talk-based unlicensed band allocation with
the buffering mechanism for the License-Assisted Access (LAA) packets in the
heterogeneous networks. In such a network, unlicensed band allocation for LAA
and Wi-Fi is an important issue, which may affect the quality of service for
both systems significantly. We evaluate the performance of these unlicensed

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an analytical model for resource allocation in D2D-assisted cellular networks, considering both licensed and unlicensed bands, and accounts for interactions with Wi-Fi systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize resource allocation in D2D-assisted cellular networks, improve overlay D2D performance, and ensure quality-of-service for Wi-Fi users.

Method: The model uses a global system state reflecting interactions between D2D, conventional cellular, and Wi-Fi packets. It employs a threshold-based flow control to balance QoS for Wi-Fi and derives packet blockage probability.

Result: Simulation results indicate a small performance sacrifice in conventional cellular systems leads to significant improvement in overlay D2D performance, while maintaining Wi-Fi user performance. The model also offers better flexibility compared to underlay schemes.

Conclusion: The proposed analytical model effectively balances the trade-offs between different network elements, ensuring QoS for Wi-Fi users and improving overlay D2D performance with minimal impact on cellular systems.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel analytical model for resource allocation is proposed
for a device-to-device (D2D) assisted cellular network. The proposed model can
be applied to underlay and overlay D2D systems for sharing licensed bands and
offloading cellular traffic. The developed model also takes into account the
problem of unlicensed band sharing with Wi-Fi systems. In the proposed model, a
global system state reflects the interaction among D2D, conventional cellular,
and Wi-Fi packets. Under the standard traffic model assumptions, a
threshold-based flow control is proposed for guaranteeing the
quality-of-service (QoS) of Wi-Fi. The packet blockage probability is then
derived. Simulation results show the proposed scheme sacrifices conventional
cellular performance slightly to improve overlay D2D performance significantly
while maintaining the performance for Wi-Fi users. Meanwhile, the proposed
scheme has more flexible adjustments between D2D and Wi-Fi than the underlay
scheme.

*Anis Bekri,Amar Abane,Abdella Battou,Saddek Bensalem*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid pipeline combining LLMs, formal methods, and Optical RAG to enhance intent-based networking reliability and correctness for optical networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Translating natural-language intents into optical network topologies is challenging, primarily due to ambiguities in LLMs and the need for rigorous methods.

Method: A hybrid pipeline integrates Large Language Models for intent parsing, formal methods, and Optical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enrich design accuracy with domain-specific standards and symbolic reasoning.

Result: The pipeline produces explainable and verifiable optical network designs that are trustworthy and suitable for mission-critical tasks.

Conclusion: The approach improves Intent-Based Networking by addressing LLM limitations and ensuring the reliability and correctness of optical network designs.

Abstract: Intent-Based Networking (IBN) aims to simplify network management by enabling
users to specify high-level goals that drive automated network design and
configuration. However, translating informal natural-language intents into
formally correct optical network topologies remains challenging due to inherent
ambiguity and lack of rigor in Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this,
we propose a novel hybrid pipeline that integrates LLM-based intent parsing,
formal methods, and Optical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). By enriching
design decisions with domain-specific optical standards and systematically
incorporating symbolic reasoning and verification techniques, our pipeline
generates explainable, verifiable, and trustworthy optical network designs.
This approach significantly advances IBN by ensuring reliability and
correctness, essential for mission-critical networking tasks.

### [1340] [Impact of Environmental Factors on LoRa 2.4 GHz Time of Flight Ranging Outdoors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23125)

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of current localization techniques in WSN/IoT and investigates the impact of environmental factors like temperature and humidity on the accuracy of LoRa 2.4 GHz RF ToF ranging, using a dataset collected in a controlled outdoor setup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Localization is critical for precise monitoring in WSN/IoT applications, but current techniques are limited by low time resolution and environmental factors, necessitating improved methods.

Method: The study collected ranging data using a 2.4 GHz LoRa system in a controlled outdoor setting with variations in temperature and humidity, using a setup involving three LoRa nodes and a base station over a 3x3 grid (400m²) for three weeks.

Result: A preliminary analysis with a simple DNN model revealed that temperature and humidity significantly affect the accuracy of LoRa RF ToF ranging.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for advanced methods to compensate for the environmental impacts on LoRa RF ToF ranging in outdoor scenarios.

Abstract: In WSN/IoT, node localization is essential to long-running applications for
accurate environment monitoring and event detection, often covering a large
area in the field. Due to the lower time resolution of typical WSN/IoT
platforms (e.g., 1 microsecond on ESP32 platforms) and the jitters in
timestamping, packet-level localization techniques cannot provide meter-level
resolution. For high-precision localization as well as world-wide
interoperability via 2.4-GHz ISM band, a new variant of LoRa, called LoRa 2.4
GHz, was proposed by semtech, which provides a radio frequency (RF) time of
flight (ToF) ranging method for meter-level localization. However, the existing
datasets reported in the literature are limited in their coverages and do not
take into account varying environmental factors such as temperature and
humidity. To address these issues, LoRa 2.4 GHz RF ToF ranging data was
collected on a sports field at the XJTLU south campus, where three LoRa nodes
logged samples of ranging with a LoRa base station, together with temperature
and humidity, at reference points arranged as a 3x3 grid covering 400 square
meter over three weeks and uploaded all measurement records to the base station
equipped with an ESP32-based transceiver for machine and user communications.
The results of a preliminary investigation based on a simple deep neural
network (DNN) model demonstrate that the environmental factors, including the
temperature and humidity, significantly affect the accuracy of ranging, which
calls for advanced methods of compensating for the effects of environmental
factors on LoRa RF ToF ranging outdoors.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper addresses generalizability issues in DRL-based forwarding strategies for dynamic mobile networks by proposing a solution that includes designing a generalizable base model and fine-tuning for new scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of existing DRL strategies that are not generalizable to different network scenarios significantly deviating from the training environment.

Method: The authors develop a generalizable base model using diverse mobile network scenarios, create new features for better network characterization, and implement a continual learning approach to train DRL models without catastrophic forgetting.

Result: The approach demonstrates strong generalizability to unseen mobility scenarios with up to 78% reduction in delay, 24% improvement in delivery rate, and comparable or slightly higher number of forwards when compared to a state-of-the-art forwarding strategy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses generalizability in DRL forwarding strategies and shows robust results across diverse and real-world network scenarios.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been successfully used to design
forwarding strategies for multi-hop mobile wireless networks. While such
strategies can be used directly for networks with varied connectivity and
dynamic conditions, developing generalizable approaches that are effective on
scenarios significantly different from the training environment remains largely
unexplored. In this paper, we propose a framework to address the challenge of
generalizability by (i) developing a generalizable base model considering
diverse mobile network scenarios, and (ii) using the generalizable base model
for new scenarios, and when needed, fine-tuning the base model using a small
amount of data from the new scenarios. To support this framework, we first
design new features to characterize network variation and feature quality,
thereby improving the information used in DRL-based forwarding decisions. We
then develop a continual learning (CL) approach able to train DRL models across
diverse network scenarios without ``catastrophic forgetting.'' Using extensive
evaluation, including real-world scenarios in two cities, we show that our
approach is generalizable to unseen mobility scenarios. Compared to a
state-of-the-art heuristic forwarding strategy, it leads to up to 78% reduction
in delay, 24% improvement in delivery rate, and comparable or slightly higher
number of forwards.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-supervised learning method to automatically correlate network incidents using contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Network operators require automated tools to correlate incidents efficiently due to the infeasibility of manual correlation in large-scale networks.

Method: The approach applies contrastive learning to train a deep neural network on an unlabeled dataset of network situations for similarity-based correlation.

Result: Experiments on real-world network monitoring data show high precision in incident correlation using the proposed method.

Conclusion: Contrastive learning demonstrates a strong potential for automating the correlation of network incidents, improving productivity in network monitoring tasks.

Abstract: Internet service providers monitor their networks to detect, triage, and
remediate service impairments. When an incident is detected, it is important to
determine whether similar incidents have occurred in the past or are happening
concurrently elsewhere in the network. Manual correlation of such incidents is
infeasible due to the scale of the networks under observation, making automated
correlation a necessity. This paper presents a self-supervised learning method
for similarity-based correlation of network situations. Using this method, a
deep neural network is trained on a large unlabeled dataset of network
situations using contrastive learning. High precision achieved in experiments
on real-world network monitoring data suggests that contrastive learning is a
promising approach to network incident correlation.

*Ryan Carey,Marina Maciel Ansanelli,Elie Wolfe,Robin J. Evans*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new graphical framework, selected-marginalized directed graphs (smDGs), to better represent indistinguishable causal structures with latent and selected vertices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distinguishing causal graphs in scenarios involving latent factors, selection bias, and interventions remains challenging with existing criteria.

Method: Introduce smDGs as a novel framework, replace d-separation with a new separation criterion, and derive conditions for indistinguishability based on passive observations.

Result: The smDG framework achieves representation equivalence for causal graphs that are experimentally indistinguishable, alongside a sound and complete separation criterion and specific conditions for indistinguishability.

Conclusion: The development of smDGs enhances causal inference approaches, especially in settings with latent variables and selection bias, bridging gaps in experimental indistinguishability.

Abstract: Statistical relationships in observed data can arise for several different
reasons: the observed variables may be causally related, they may share a
latent common cause, or there may be selection bias. Each of these scenarios
can be modelled using different causal graphs. Not all such causal graphs,
however, can be distinguished by experimental data. In this paper, we formulate
the equivalence class of causal graphs as a novel graphical structure, the
selected-marginalized directed graph (smDG). That is, we show that two directed
acyclic graphs with latent and selected vertices have the same smDG if and only
if they are indistinguishable, even when allowing for arbitrary interventions
on the observed variables. As a substitute for the more familiar d-separation
criterion for DAGs, we provide an analogous sound and complete separation
criterion in smDGs for conditional independence relative to passive
observations. Finally, we provide a series of sufficient conditions under which
two causal structures are indistinguishable when there is only access to
passive observations.

Motivation: To improve understanding of learning rates for excess misclassification error and function approximation using shallow ReLU networks.

Method: Examination of convex $\eta$-norm loss functions, error estimation under Tsybakov conditions, and novel Fourier-based $L_p$ approximation analysis.

Result: Learning rates for misclassification error were derived, and $L_p$ function approximation rates for ReLU networks in Korobov spaces were proposed.

Conclusion: The findings advance theoretical understanding of classification error rates and function approximation performance in machine learning.

Abstract: In this paper, the classification algorithm arising from Tikhonov
regularization is discussed. The main intention is to derive learning rates for
the excess misclassification error according to the convex $\eta$-norm loss
function $\phi(v)=(1 - v)_{+}^{\eta}$, $\eta\geq1$. Following the argument, the
estimation of error under Tsybakov noise conditions is studied. In addition, we
propose the rate of $L_p$ approximation of functions from Korobov space $X^{2,

*Yuchen Chen,Yandi Shen*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper studies non-convex optimization and introduces a mathematical framework for analyzing a widely used two-stage algorithm consisting of spectral initialization and gradient descent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-convex optimization problems are central to many machine learning tasks, often challenging due to irregular function landscapes. However, in some contexts (like with random data and large sample sizes), favorable regions exist near the true signal, making optimization feasible.

Method: The authors analyze the two-stage algorithm in single index models under proportional asymptotics. They develop dynamical mean field equations that track the trajectory of spectral-initialized gradient descent in the large system regime.

Result: The derived equations show that when spectral initialization succeeds, the system converges exponentially to a set of long-time fixed points. For phase retrieval, regularized Wirtinger flow is used as an example to validate the theory.

Conclusion: The paper provides a precise mathematical characterization of the two-stage algorithm's dynamics, illustrating how the landscape's benign region can lead to efficient convergence for certain non-convex problems.

Abstract: Non-convex optimization plays a central role in many statistics and machine
learning problems. Despite the landscape irregularities for general non-convex
functions, some recent work showed that for many learning problems with random
data and large enough sample size, there exists a region around the true signal
with benign landscape. Motivated by this observation, a widely used strategy is
a two-stage algorithm, where we first apply a spectral initialization to plunge
into the region, and then run gradient descent for further refinement. While
this two-stage algorithm has been extensively analyzed for many non-convex
problems, the precise distributional property of both its transient and
long-time behavior remains to be understood. In this work, we study this
two-stage algorithm in the context of single index models under the
proportional asymptotics regime. We derive a set of dynamical mean field
equations, which describe the precise behavior of the trajectory of spectral
initialized gradient descent in the large system limit. We further show that
when the spectral initialization successfully lands in a region of benign
landscape, the above equation system is asymptotically time translation
invariant and exponential converging, and thus admits a set of long-time fixed
points that represents the mean field characterization of the limiting point of
the gradient descent dynamic. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate our general
theory in the example of regularized Wirtinger flow for phase retrieval.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a system in Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC) that manages task allocation and revenue-sharing to achieve profitability, low latency, and sustainability, reducing CO2 emissions significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether VCC can be both profitable and sustainable, addressing the lack of quantitative evidence supporting its environmental and economic viability in real-world applications.

Method: A novel management scheme combining energy-aware task allocation and a game-theoretic revenue-sharing mechanism under urban mobility and 5G settings, modeled with latency, energy consumption, monetary incentives, and carbon emissions.

Result: The proposed framework enables effective monetization, low-latency task execution, and a dramatic reduction in CO2 emissions by over 99% compared to traditional edge infrastructures.

Conclusion: The study establishes VCC as a profitable and environmentally sustainable alternative to conventional edge computing through innovative task management and fair resource monetization strategies.

Abstract: Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC) leverages the idle computing capacity of
vehicles to execute end-users' offloaded tasks without requiring new
computation infrastructure. Despite its conceptual appeal, VCC adoption is
hindered by the lack of quantitative evidence demonstrating its profitability
and environmental advantages in real-world scenarios. This paper tackles the
fundamental question: Can VCC be both profitable and sustainable? We address
this problem by proposing a management scheme for VCC that combines
energy-aware task allocation with a game-theoretic revenue-sharing mechanism.
Our framework is the first to jointly model latency, energy consumption,
monetary incentives, and carbon emissions within urban mobility and 5G
communication settings. The task allocation strategy maximizes the aggregate
stakeholder utility while satisfying deadlines and minimizing energy costs. The
payoffs are distributed via a coalitional game theory adapted to dynamic
vehicular environments, to prevent disincentivizing participants with
potentially negative contributions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our
approach supports low-latency task execution, enables effective monetization of
vehicular resources, and reduces CO2 emissions by more than 99% compared to
conventional edge infrastructures, making VCC a practical and sustainable
alternative to edge computing.

*SeungHyun Yi,Seungjun Yi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper develops a model that surpasses traditional Game-Theory-Optimal (GTO) strategies by leveraging exploitation techniques to maximize profit in poker, specifically in No Limit Holdem whether heads-up or multi-way.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While GTO strategies prevent losses in poker, they do not achieve maximal profitability. The paper aims to address this limitation by enhancing strategies to exploit opponents effectively and increase profit.

Method: The model combines the GTO baseline established via iterative simulations using Monte-Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) and adds adaptive capabilities to exploit opponents based on observed behaviors.

Result: Monte-Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) performs optimally in heads-up scenarios and remains strong in multi-way situations, demonstrating its superiority in both foundational and adaptive strategic layers.

Conclusion: By merging GTO strategies with adaptive exploitation, the proposed model successfully transitions poker agents from merely avoiding losses to consistently winning against diverse opponents.

Abstract: Game theory has grown into a major field over the past few decades, and poker
has long served as one of its key case studies. Game-Theory-Optimal (GTO)
provides strategies to avoid loss in poker, but pure GTO does not guarantee
maximum profit. To this end, we aim to develop a model that outperforms GTO
strategies to maximize profit in No Limit Holdem, in heads-up (two-player) and
multi-way (more than two-player) situations. Our model finds the GTO foundation
and goes further to exploit opponents. The model first navigates toward many
simulated poker hands against itself and keeps adjusting its decisions until no
action can reliably beat it, creating a strong baseline that is close to the
theoretical best strategy. Then, it adapts by observing opponent behavior and
adjusting its strategy to capture extra value accordingly. Our results indicate
that Monte-Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) performs best in
heads-up situations and CFR remains the strongest method in most multi-way
situations. By combining the defensive strength of GTO with real-time
exploitation, our approach aims to show how poker agents can move from merely
not losing to consistently winning against diverse opponents.

### [1348] [Grouped Satisficing Paths in Pure Strategy Games: a Topological Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23157)
*Yanqing Fu,Chao Huang,Chenrun Wang,Zhuping Wang*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the conditions under which a sequence of joint strategies, emerging from the "win-stay, lose-shift" principle in MARL, can reliably converge to equilibrium.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address a fundamental question in MARL: identifying conditions where all initial strategies lead to a finite-length path that achieves equilibrium.

Method: A sufficient condition is established guaranteeing in finite-state Markov games and $N$-player games that a satisficing path exists from any initial strategy to equilibrium.

Result: The study shows that both finite-state Markov games and $N$-player games possess the required properties for a satisficing path, reinforcing the theoretical understanding of MARL designs.

Conclusion: The findings solidify the theoretical basis for MARL algorithm design by proving that satisficing paths reliably lead to equilibrium in studied games.

Abstract: In game theory and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), each agent
selects a strategy, interacts with the environment and other agents, and
subsequently updates its strategy based on the received payoff. This process
generates a sequence of joint strategies $(s^t)_{t \geq 0}$, where $s^t$
represents the strategy profile of all agents at time step $t$. A widely
adopted principle in MARL algorithms is "win-stay, lose-shift", which dictates
that an agent retains its current strategy if it achieves the best response.
This principle exhibits a fixed-point property when the joint strategy has
become an equilibrium. The sequence of joint strategies under this principle is
referred to as a satisficing path, a concept first introduced in [40] and
explored in the context of $N$-player games in [39]. A fundamental question
arises regarding this principle: Under what conditions does every initial joint
strategy $s$ admit a finite-length satisficing path $(s^t)_{0 \leq t \leq T}$
where $s^0=s$ and $s^T$ is an equilibrium? This paper establishes a sufficient
condition for such a property, and demonstrates that any finite-state Markov
game, as well as any $N$-player game, guarantees the existence of a
finite-length satisficing path from an arbitrary initial strategy to some
equilibrium. These results provide a stronger theoretical foundation for the
design of MARL algorithms.

*Merve Gülle,Junno Yun,Yaşar Utku Alçalar,Mehmet Akçakaya*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PnP-CM, a method leveraging consistency models in plug-and-play frameworks for solving inverse problems efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the sampling efficiency for inverse problems using diffusion models and bridging the gap between CM applications and real-world efficiency challenges.

Method: PnP-CM integrates consistency models with plug-and-play ADMM frameworks, enhanced by noise injection and momentum to accelerate convergence and maintain robustness.

Result: PnP-CM demonstrated high-quality results for inverse problems like inpainting, super-resolution, and MRI reconstruction, achieving accurate outputs in as few as 4 NFEs.

Conclusion: PnP-CM is effective for real-world inverse problem applications, offering faster and higher-quality solutions compared to existing CM-based approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion models have found extensive use in solving numerous inverse
problems. Such diffusion inverse problem solvers aim to sample from the
posterior distribution of data given the measurements, using a combination of
the unconditional score function and an approximation of the posterior related
to the forward process. Recently, consistency models (CMs) have been proposed
to directly predict the final output from any point on the diffusion ODE
trajectory, enabling high-quality sampling in just a few NFEs. CMs have also
been utilized for inverse problems, but existing CM-based solvers either
require additional task-specific training or utilize data fidelity operations
with slow convergence, not amenable to large-scale problems. In this work, we
reinterpret CMs as proximal operators of a prior, enabling their integration
into plug-and-play (PnP) frameworks. We propose a solver based on PnP-ADMM,
which enables us to leverage the fast convergence of conjugate gradient method.
We further accelerate this with noise injection and momentum, dubbed PnP-CM,
and show it maintains the convergence properties of the baseline PnP-ADMM. We
evaluate our approach on a variety of inverse problems, including inpainting,
super-resolution, Gaussian deblurring, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CM trained for
MRI datasets. Our results show that PnP-CM achieves high-quality
reconstructions in as few as 4 NFEs, and can produce meaningful results in 2
steps, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world inverse problems while
outperforming comparable CM-based approaches.

*Raghavv Goel,Cecilia Morales,Manpreet Singh,Artur Dubrawski,John Galeotti,Howie Choset*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach combining Kalman Filter techniques with CNN for enhanced needle segmentation in 2D ultrasound images, achieving improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Needle segmentation in ultrasound images is difficult due to artifacts, noise, occlusion, and limited data. Addressing these challenges is necessary for better medical imaging applications.

Method: The authors integrate classical Kalman Filter techniques with data-driven CNN learning into encoder-decoder architectures. They also introduce a learnable filter to account for non-linear needle motion.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models, reducing needle tip error by 15% and length error by 8%.

Conclusion: Their framework improves the accuracy of needle segmentation, especially in challenging conditions, and advances the integration of motion features in learnable CNN models.

Abstract: Segmenting a moving needle in ultrasound images is challenging due to the
presence of artifacts, noise, and needle occlusion. This task becomes even more
demanding in scenarios where data availability is limited. In this paper, we
present a novel approach for needle segmentation for 2D ultrasound that
combines classical Kalman Filter (KF) techniques with data-driven learning,
incorporating both needle features and needle motion. Our method offers three
key contributions. First, we propose a compatible framework that seamlessly
integrates into commonly used encoder-decoder style architectures. Second, we
demonstrate superior performance compared to recent state-of-the-art needle
segmentation models using our novel convolutional neural network (CNN) based
KF-inspired block, achieving a 15\% reduction in pixel-wise needle tip error
and an 8\% reduction in length error. Third, to our knowledge we are the first
to implement a learnable filter to incorporate non-linear needle motion for
improving needle segmentation.

*Md. Saiful Bari Siddiqui,Mohammed Imamul Hassan Bhuiyan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Spatial-Spectral Summarizer Fusion Network (S$^3$F-Net), a dual-domain framework combining spatial CNNs with spectral encoding for enhanced medical image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in capturing global patterns and frequency-domain characteristics of medical images motivates the development of a dual-domain approach.

Method: A dual-branch framework is proposed, integrating spatial CNNs with SpectraNet, which uses the novel SpectralFilter layer for Fourier spectrum-based global feature extraction combined with a lightweight summarizer network.

Result: The proposed S$^3$F-Net demonstrates significant accuracy improvements, achieving up to 98.76% on BRISC2025 and 93.11% on Chest X-Ray Pneumonia datasets.

Conclusion: The S$^3$F-Net successfully combines spatial and spectral representations, proving its efficacy and generalizability for medical image analysis while dynamically adapting to pathologies.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks have become a cornerstone of medical image
analysis due to their proficiency in learning hierarchical spatial features.
However, this focus on a single domain is inefficient at capturing global,
holistic patterns and fails to explicitly model an image's frequency-domain
characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Spectral
Summarizer Fusion Network (S$^3$F-Net), a dual-branch framework that learns
from both spatial and spectral representations simultaneously. The S$^3$F-Net
performs a fusion of a deep spatial CNN with our proposed shallow spectral
encoder, SpectraNet. SpectraNet features the proposed SpectralFilter layer,
which leverages the Convolution Theorem by applying a bank of learnable filters
directly to an image's full Fourier spectrum via a computation-efficient
element-wise multiplication. This allows the SpectralFilter layer to attain a
global receptive field instantaneously, with its output being distilled by a
lightweight summarizer network. We evaluate S$^3$F-Net across four medical
imaging datasets spanning different modalities to validate its efficacy and
generalizability. Our framework consistently and significantly outperforms its
strong spatial-only baseline in all cases, with accuracy improvements of up to
5.13%. With a powerful Bilinear Fusion, S$^3$F-Net achieves a SOTA competitive
accuracy of 98.76% on the BRISC2025 dataset. Concatenation Fusion performs
better on the texture-dominant Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset, achieving 93.11%
accuracy, surpassing many top-performing, much deeper models. Our
explainability analysis also reveals that the S$^3$F-Net learns to dynamically
adjust its reliance on each branch based on the input pathology. These results
verify that our dual-domain approach is a powerful and generalizable paradigm
for medical image analysis.

TL;DR: VIRTUS-FPP offers a virtual modeling framework for Fringe Projection Profilometry (FPP), reducing calibration burdens and enabling digital twin capabilities through physics-based simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of FPP, including complex calibration, large system footprint, and environmental sensitivities.

Method: Developed VIRTUS-FPP framework in NVIDIA Isaac Sim with end-to-end physics-based modeling for structured light principles.

Result: Accurate virtual reconstruction and validation against real-world measurements with enhanced system flexibility.

Conclusion: VIRTUS-FPP accelerates FPP system development via virtual prototyping, providing comparable accuracy to physical implementations and new possibilities for environmental and configuration controls.

Abstract: Fringe projection profilometry (FPP) has been established as a high-accuracy
3D reconstruction method capable of achieving sub-pixel accuracy. However, this
technique faces significant constraints due to complex calibration
requirements, bulky system footprint, and sensitivity to environmental
conditions. To address these limitations, we present VIRTUS-FPP, the first
comprehensive physics-based virtual sensor modeling framework for FPP built in
NVIDIA Isaac Sim. By leveraging the physics-based rendering and programmable
sensing capabilities of simulation, our framework enables end-to-end modeling
from calibration to reconstruction with full mathematical fidelity to the
underlying principles of structured light. We conduct comprehensive virtual
calibration and validate our system's reconstruction accuracy through
quantitative comparison against ground truth geometry. Additionally, we
demonstrate the ability to model the virtual system as a digital twin by
replicating a physical FPP system in simulation and validating correspondence
between virtual and real-world measurements. Experimental results demonstrate
that VIRTUS-FPP accurately models optical phenomena critical to FPP and
achieves results comparable to real-world systems while offering unprecedented
flexibility for system configuration, sensor prototyping, and environmental
control. This framework significantly accelerates the development of real-world
FPP systems by enabling rapid virtual prototyping before physical
implementation.

*MohammadReza Abbaszadeh Bavil Soflaei,Karim SamadZamini*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study introduces a deep learning framework for cataract detection via retinal imaging, achieving high accuracy with various model architectures, including Swin-Base Transformer and lightweight MobileNetV3 models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cataracts are a major global issue causing visual impairment, necessitating efficient and early detection methods using retinal imaging for timely treatment.

Method: The study utilized the Ocular Disease Recognition dataset with 5000 patients' retinal images to train and evaluate different deep learning models, including CNNs, transformers, and knowledge-distilled models, with a focus on balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.

Result: The Swin-Base Transformer performed best with 98.58% accuracy, while a distilled MobileNetV3 model achieved 98.42% accuracy with lower computational costs. A Siamese variant combining information from both eyes attained 98.21% accuracy.

Conclusion: Highly accurate and interpretable cataract detection can be achieved, even with lightweight models, making them suitable for clinical use in low-resource environments.

Abstract: Cataract remains a leading cause of visual impairment worldwide, and early
detection from retinal imaging is critical for timely intervention. We present
a deep learning pipeline for cataract classification using the Ocular Disease
Recognition dataset, containing left and right fundus photographs from 5000
patients. We evaluated CNNs, transformers, lightweight architectures, and
knowledge-distilled models. The top-performing model, Swin-Base Transformer,
achieved 98.58% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9836. A distilled MobileNetV3,
trained with Swin-Base knowledge, reached 98.42% accuracy and a 0.9787 F1-score
with greatly reduced computational cost. The proposed dual-eye Siamese variant
of the distilled MobileNet, integrating information from both eyes, achieved an
accuracy of 98.21%. Explainability analysis using Grad-CAM demonstrated that
the CNNs concentrated on medically significant features, such as lens opacity
and central blur. These results show that accurate, interpretable cataract
detection is achievable even with lightweight models, supporting potential
clinical integration in resource-limited settings

### [1354] [Achieving Fair Skin Lesion Detection through Skin Tone Normalization and Channel Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22712)
*Zihan Wei,Tapabrata Chakraborti*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Individual Typology Angle (ITA) Loss-based skin tone normalization and data augmentation method integrated with a meta learning-based joint channel pruning framework to mitigate biases in skin lesion classification without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biases in deep-learning-based skin lesion classification models arise due to unbalanced datasets, leading to unfairness concerning demographic attributes such as race, age, and gender. Current solutions either sacrifice accuracy for fairness, address fairness only for a single attribute, or lack integration within model learning.

Method: The proposed method consists of ITA Loss-based skin tone normalization to balance datasets by estimating and adjusting skin tones and a joint channel pruning framework using nested optimization loops. The inner loop prunes local critical channels with weighted nearest neighbor loss, while the outer loop updates attribute weights using group-wise variance loss.

Result: Experimental results on the ISIC2019 dataset show that the method improves fairness across multiple sensitive attributes without significant accuracy degradation. However, the additional training computation cost is manageable as training is performed offline.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively mitigates bias in skin lesion classification models, balances multiple sensitive attributes, and maintains accuracy, making it practical despite added training complexity.

Abstract: Recent works have shown that deep learning based skin lesion image
classification models trained on unbalanced dataset can exhibit bias toward
protected demographic attributes such as race, age,and gender. Current bias
mitigation methods usually either achieve high level of fairness with the
degradation of accuracy, or only improve the model fairness on a single
attribute. Additionally usually most bias mitigation strategies are either pre
hoc through data processing or post hoc through fairness evaluation, instead of
being integrated into the model learning itself. To solve these existing
drawbacks, we propose a new Individual Typology Angle (ITA) Loss-based skin
tone normalization and data augmentation method that directly feeds into an
adaptable meta learning-based joint channel pruning framework. In skin tone
normalization, ITA is used to estimate skin tone type and adjust automatically
to target tones for dataset balancing. In the joint channel pruning framework,
two nested optimization loops are used to find critical channels.The inner
optimization loop finds and prunes the local critical channels by weighted soft
nearest neighbor loss, and the outer optimization loop updates the weight of
each attribute using group wise variance loss on meta-set. Experiments
conducted in the ISIC2019 dataset validate the effectiveness of our method in
simultaneously improving the fairness of the model on multiple sensitive
attributes without significant degradation of accuracy. Finally, although the
pruning mechanism adds some computational cost during training phase, usually
training is done off line. More importantly,

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: UTMB collaborated with Zauron Labs, Inc. to use AI tools for detecting and coding aortic calcifications in chest radiographs, uncovering miscodes and missed diagnoses to enhance patient care and recover lost revenue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve detection and coding accuracy of aortic calcifications, which are often underreported despite their importance in cardiovascular disease prognosis.

Method: Applied advanced AI tools, including a high-performing image model and a fine-tuned language model, to retrospectively analyze data and identify underreported cases.

Result: Detected 12.4% coding errors and 2.1% misdiagnosis rate in the analysis of 3,988 patients, enabling UTMB to potentially recover $314k in annual revenue.

Conclusion: Adoption of AI-enhanced peer review and coding system-wide improves clinical care and financial outcomes.

Abstract: This case study details The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB)'s
partnership with Zauron Labs, Inc. to enhance detection and coding of aortic
calcifications (ACs) using chest radiographs. ACs are often underreported
despite their significant prognostic value for cardiovascular disease, and UTMB
partnered with Zauron to apply its advanced AI tools, including a
high-performing image model (AUC = 0.938) and a fine-tuned language model based
on Meta's Llama 3.2, to retrospectively analyze imaging and report data. The
effort identified 495 patients out of 3,988 unique patients assessed (5,000
total exams) whose reports contained indications of aortic calcifications that
were not properly coded for reimbursement (12.4% miscode rate) as well as an
additional 84 patients who had aortic calcifications that were missed during
initial review (2.1% misdiagnosis rate). Identification of these patients
provided UTMB with the potential to impact clinical care for these patients and
pursue $314k in missed annual revenue. These findings informed UTMB's decision
to adopt Zauron's Guardian Pro software system-wide to ensure accurate,
AI-enhanced peer review and coding, improving both patient care and financial
solvency. This study is covered under University of Texas Health San Antonio's

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores the potential of AI-enhanced Time-Dependent Diffusion MRI (TDD-MRI) for accurate diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer, addressing the limitations of mpMRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diagnostic approaches for prostate cancer, such as mpMRI, are limited due to false positives, negatives, and interobserver variability, necessitating improved methods.

Method: This study combines TDD-MRI-derived metrics with machine learning through the PROSTDAI software to enhance diagnostic accuracy, assess zone-specific risk, and compare with PI-RADS and biopsy results.

Result: The paper proposes a framework for evaluating PROSTDAI’s accuracy and practical diagnostic value against existing methods in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer.

Conclusion: AI-enhanced TDD-MRI could provide a more precise diagnostic tool for prostate cancer, reducing dependency on reader expertise and improving overall detection and risk assessment.

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in men and
the eighth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI)
has become central to the diagnostic pathway for men at intermediate risk,
improving de-tection of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) while reducing
unnecessary biopsies and over-diagnosis. However, mpMRI remains limited by
false positives, false negatives, and moderate to substantial interobserver
agreement. Time-dependent diffusion (TDD) MRI, a novel sequence that enables
tissue microstructure characterization, has shown encouraging preclinical
performance in distinguishing clinically significant from insignificant PCa.
Combining TDD-derived metrics with machine learning may provide robust,
zone-specific risk prediction with less dependence on reader training and
improved accuracy compared to current standard-of-care. This study protocol
out-lines the rationale and describes the prospective evaluation of a
home-developed AI-enhanced TDD-MRI software (PROSTDAI) in routine diagnostic
care, assessing its added value against PI-RADS v2.1 and validating results
against MRI-guided prostate biopsy.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ReCon-GS is a new framework for efficient free-viewpoint video reconstruction, addressing optimization speed, motion consistency, and storage demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Free-viewpoint video reconstruction is constrained by slow processing, inconsistent motion estimation, and excessive storage needs.

Method: ReCon-GS uses a dynamic Anchor Gaussians hierarchy and reconfiguration strategy to represent geometric deformations accurately while balancing fidelity and memory.

Result: ReCon-GS improves training efficiency by 15%, enhances synthesis quality and stability, and cuts memory usage by over 50% at equivalent rendering quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a highly resource-efficient solution for FVV systems, combining speed, fidelity, and reduced storage costs.

Abstract: Online free-viewpoint video (FVV) reconstruction is challenged by slow
per-frame optimization, inconsistent motion estimation, and unsustainable
storage demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Reconfigurable
Continuum Gaussian Stream, dubbed ReCon-GS, a novel storage-aware framework
that enables high fidelity online dynamic scene reconstruction and real-time
rendering. Specifically, we dynamically allocate multi-level Anchor Gaussians
in a density-adaptive fashion to capture inter-frame geometric deformations,
thereby decomposing scene motion into compact coarse-to-fine representations.
Then, we design a dynamic hierarchy reconfiguration strategy that preserves
localized motion expressiveness through on-demand anchor re-hierarchization,
while ensuring temporal consistency through intra-hierarchical deformation
inheritance that confines transformation priors to their respective hierarchy
levels. Furthermore, we introduce a storage-aware optimization mechanism that
flexibly adjusts the density of Anchor Gaussians at different hierarchy levels,
enabling a controllable trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and memory
usage. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that,
compared to state-of-the-art methods, ReCon-GS improves training efficiency by
approximately 15% and achieves superior FVV synthesis quality with enhanced
robustness and stability. Moreover, at equivalent rendering quality, ReCon-GS
slashes memory requirements by over 50% compared to leading state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study introduces WMSR framework leveraging Wavelet-assisted Mamba Super-Resolution for enhancing SST data accuracy by combining LFSSM for low-frequency and HFEM for high-frequency modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the resolution of SST data, a crucial climate indicator, remains challenging due to imaging limitations and unexplored super-resolution potentials.

Method: The approach integrates 2D State Space Models in the LFSSM for global information and HFEM for enhancing high-frequency details via pixel difference convolution.

Result: Experiments on three SST datasets validate WMSR's superior performance over existing methods.

Conclusion: The WMSR framework offers promising advancement in SST data resolution, leveraging novel modules for balanced low and high-frequency comprehensive enhancement.

Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) is an essential indicator of global climate
change and one of the most intuitive factors reflecting ocean conditions.
Obtaining high-resolution SST data remains challenging due to limitations in
physical imaging, and super-resolution via deep neural networks is a promising
solution. Recently, Mamba-based approaches leveraging State Space Models (SSM)
have demonstrated significant potential for long-range dependency modeling with
linear complexity. However, their application to SST data super-resolution
remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the Wavelet-assisted Mamba
Super-Resolution (WMSR) framework for satellite-derived SST data. The WMSR
includes two key components: the Low-Frequency State Space Module (LFSSM) and
High-Frequency Enhancement Module (HFEM). The LFSSM uses 2D-SSM to capture
global information of the input data, and the robust global modeling
capabilities of SSM are exploited to preserve the critical temperature
information in the low-frequency component. The HFEM employs the pixel
difference convolution to match and correct the high-frequency feature,
achieving accurate and clear textures. Through comprehensive experiments on
three SST datasets, our WMSR demonstrated superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods. Our codes and datasets will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/oucailab/WMSR.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for early detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) involving preprocessing, segmentation, and classification stages using advanced filtering and deep learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable early detection and timely intervention of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and macular edema (DME), preventing vision loss and effectively managing diabetic complications.

Method: The proposed framework includes three main stages: (1) Preprocessing with fuzzy/non-linear diffusion filtering and a novel AVDS filter adapting four distance methods to improve data quality, (2) Segmentation via Improved Mask RCNN, and (3) Feature extraction and classification using SSA-VGG-16 to enhance accuracy.

Result: Analysis indicated that the Hamming distance method in the AVDS filter produced better contrast, while Euclidean distance showed less error with high PSNR. The overall approach demonstrated efficacy on the IDRiD and MESSIDOR datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively detects and grades diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) by integrating innovative preprocessing filters, segmentation, and robust feature classification methodologies.

Abstract: Early detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is crucial as it allows for
timely intervention, preventing vision loss and enabling effective management
of diabetic complications. This research performs detection of DR and DME at an
early stage through the proposed framework which includes three stages:
preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. In the
preprocessing stage, noise filtering is performed by fuzzy filtering, artefact
removal is performed by non-linear diffusion filtering, and the contrast
improvement is performed by a novel filter called Adaptive Variable Distance
Speckle (AVDS) filter. The AVDS filter employs four distance calculation
methods such as Euclidean, Bhattacharya, Manhattan, and Hamming. The filter
adaptively chooses a distance method which produces the highest contrast value
amongst all 3 methods. From the analysis, hamming distance method was found to
achieve better results for contrast and Euclidean distance showing less error
value with high PSNR. The segmentation stage is performed using Improved
Mask-Regional Convolutional Neural Networks (Mask RCNN). In the final stage,
feature extraction and classification using novel Self-Spatial Attention
infused VGG-16 (SSA-VGG-16), which effectively captures both global contextual
relationships and critical spatial regions within retinal images, thereby
improving the accuracy and robustness of DR and DME detection and grading. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is assessed using two distinct datasets:
IDRiD and MESSIDOR.

and semantics guide the production of gestures by determining their timing
(WHEN) and style (HOW), while the spatial locations of interactive objects
dictate their directional execution (WHERE). Existing approaches either rely
solely on descriptive language to generate motions or utilize audio to produce
non-interactive gestures, thereby lacking the characterization of interactive
timing and spatial intent. This significantly limits the applicability of
conversational gesture generation, whether in robotics or in the fields of game
and animation production. To address this gap, we present a full-stack
solution. We first established a unique data collection method to
simultaneously capture high-precision human motion and spatial intent. We then
developed a generation model driven by audio, language, and spatial data,
alongside dedicated metrics for evaluating interaction timing and spatial
accuracy. Finally, we deployed the solution on a humanoid robot, enabling rich,
context-aware physical interactions.

*Weidan Xiong,Yongli Wu,Bochuan Zeng,Jianwei Guo,Dani Lischinski,Daniel Cohen-Or,Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated method to generate realistic texture maps for architectural proxy models using unordered registered photographs, optimizing for visual and structural detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Architectural proxy models simplify geometric structures but lose fine details, necessitating advanced texture generation to preserve original reconstruction fidelity.

Method: The method establishes correspondences between texels and image pixels for texture mapping, leveraging weighted blending and differentiable rendering for optimization and consistency.

Result: The approach effectively generates high-quality textures, demonstrating robustness across different architectural models and photographic conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully provides detailed and seamless textures for architectural proxies, ensuring fidelity and utility in representing original structures.

Abstract: Simplified proxy models are commonly used to represent architectural
structures, reducing storage requirements and enabling real-time rendering.
However, the geometric simplifications inherent in proxies result in a loss of
fine color and geometric details, making it essential for textures to
compensate for the loss. Preserving the rich texture information from the
original dense architectural reconstructions remains a daunting task,
particularly when working with unordered RGB photographs. We propose an
automated method for generating realistic texture maps for architectural proxy
models at the texel level from an unordered collection of registered
photographs. Our approach establishes correspondences between texels on a UV
map and pixels in the input images, with each texel's color computed as a
weighted blend of associated pixel values. Using differentiable rendering, we
optimize blending parameters to ensure photometric and perspective consistency,
while maintaining seamless texture coherence. Experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness and robustness of our method across diverse architectural
models and varying photographic conditions, enabling the creation of
high-quality textures that preserve visual fidelity and structural detail.

*Arjun Teh,Delio Vicini,Bernd Bickel,Ioannis Gkioulekas,Matthew O'Toole*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The study presents a method for jointly optimizing both continuous and discrete parameters of compound lens designs, improving their speed, sharpness, or both.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated compound lens design is typically limited to optimizing continuous parameters, leaving topology changes and broader design exploration dependent on extensive expert intervention.

Method: The method combines gradient-based optimization for continuous parameters and a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm for discrete parameters, utilizing transdimensional mutation and paraxial projection for efficient exploration.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved lens designs compared to previous methods, achieving superior balance in speed-sharpness tradeoffs.

Conclusion: The approach expands the design space of compound lenses, providing automated tools for better and faster lens design optimization.

Abstract: We introduce a method that automatically and jointly updates both continuous
and discrete parameters of a compound lens design, to improve its performance
in terms of sharpness, speed, or both. Previous methods for compound lens
design use gradient-based optimization to update continuous parameters (e.g.,
curvature of individual lens elements) of a given lens topology, requiring
extensive expert intervention to realize topology changes. By contrast, our
method can additionally optimize discrete parameters such as number and type
(e.g., singlet or doublet) of lens elements. Our method achieves this
capability by combining gradient-based optimization with a tailored Markov
chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm, using transdimensional mutation and
paraxial projection operations for efficient global exploration. We show
experimentally on a variety of lens design tasks that our method effectively
explores an expanded design space of compound lenses, producing better designs
than previous methods and pushing the envelope of speed-sharpness tradeoffs
achievable by automated lens design.

*Xiang Tang,Ruotong Li,Xiaopeng Fan*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ZeroScene introduces a zero-shot method for 3D scene reconstruction and texture editing by leveraging vision models, ensuring coherence, accuracy, and texture consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges in 3D scene reconstruction (ensuring individual asset quality and scene coherence) and texture editing (maintaining local continuity and multi-view consistency).

Method: ZeroScene leverages vision models to extract 2D segmentation and depth, optimizes 3D and 2D projection losses, and introduces a mask-guided progressive image generation strategy for texture consistency.

Result: Experimental results show that ZeroScene produces geometrically accurate assets, coherent scene layouts, and detailed textures aligned with text prompts.

Conclusion: ZeroScene offers a significant improvement in 3D content generation, achieving high-quality asset reconstruction and texture continuity with strong multi-view consistency.

Abstract: In the field of 3D content generation, single image scene reconstruction
methods still struggle to simultaneously ensure the quality of individual
assets and the coherence of the overall scene in complex environments, while
texture editing techniques often fail to maintain both local continuity and
multi-view consistency. In this paper, we propose a novel system ZeroScene,
which leverages the prior knowledge of large vision models to accomplish both
single image-to-3D scene reconstruction and texture editing in a zero-shot
manner. ZeroScene extracts object-level 2D segmentation and depth information
from input images to infer spatial relationships within the scene. It then
jointly optimizes 3D and 2D projection losses of the point cloud to update
object poses for precise scene alignment, ultimately constructing a coherent
and complete 3D scene that encompasses both foreground and background.
Moreover, ZeroScene supports texture editing of objects in the scene. By
imposing constraints on the diffusion model and introducing a mask-guided
progressive image generation strategy, we effectively maintain texture
consistency across multiple viewpoints and further enhance the realism of
rendered results through Physically Based Rendering (PBR) material estimation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only ensures the
geometric and appearance accuracy of generated assets, but also faithfully
reconstructs scene layouts and produces highly detailed textures that closely
align with text prompts.

*Zhenyu Shu,Jian Yao,Shiqing Xin*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a point cloud completion method using a novel framework (DFG-PCN) for better 3D reconstruction by adapting to geometric complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome inefficiencies and suboptimal reconstruction in traditional point cloud methods caused by their inability to adapt to varying geometric complexity.

Method: The DFG-PCN framework adaptively assigns node degrees based on a detail-aware metric combining feature variation and curvature. It also includes a geometry-aware graph integration module for better representation.

Result: Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that DFG-PCN consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach delivers superior performance in reconstructing complete point clouds by focusing on structurally important regions and enhancing feature representation.

Abstract: Point cloud completion is a vital task focused on reconstructing complete
point clouds and addressing the incompleteness caused by occlusion and limited
sensor resolution. Traditional methods relying on fixed local region
partitioning, such as k-nearest neighbors, which fail to account for the highly
uneven distribution of geometric complexity across different regions of a
shape. This limitation leads to inefficient representation and suboptimal
reconstruction, especially in areas with fine-grained details or structural
discontinuities. This paper proposes a point cloud completion framework called
Degree-Flexible Point Graph Completion Network (DFG-PCN). It adaptively assigns
node degrees using a detail-aware metric that combines feature variation and
curvature, focusing on structurally important regions. We further introduce a
geometry-aware graph integration module that uses Manhattan distance for edge
aggregation and detail-guided fusion of local and global features to enhance
representation. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches.

*Zhenyu Shu,Jiajun Shen,Zhongui Chen,Xiaoguang Han,Shiqing Xin*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces StrucADT, the first method enabling controllable 3D point cloud generation based on user-specified shape structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing 3D point cloud generation methods lack the ability to generate shapes based on user-specified control over shape structures, which limits their real-world applicability.

Method: The authors propose a StructureGraph representation to encode part existence and adjacency relationships, and use StrucADT. StrucADT includes three components: StructureGraphNet for extracting structure-aware latent features, cCNF Prior for learning part-adjacency-controlled distributions, and a Diffusion Transformer to generate 3D shapes.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art results in controllable 3D point cloud generation on the ShapeNet dataset, generating diverse, high-quality, and controllable 3D point cloud shapes.

Conclusion: The proposed method allows 3D point cloud generation under user-given structural controls, significantly advancing the controllability and applicability of 3D shape generation techniques.

Abstract: In the field of 3D point cloud generation, numerous 3D generative models have
demonstrated the ability to generate diverse and realistic 3D shapes. However,
the majority of these approaches struggle to generate controllable 3D point
cloud shapes that meet user-specific requirements, hindering the large-scale
application of 3D point cloud generation. To address the challenge of lacking
control in 3D point cloud generation, we are the first to propose controlling
the generation of point clouds by shape structures that comprise part
existences and part adjacency relationships. We manually annotate the adjacency
relationships between the segmented parts of point cloud shapes, thereby
constructing a StructureGraph representation. Based on this StructureGraph
representation, we introduce StrucADT, a novel structure-controllable point
cloud generation model, which consists of StructureGraphNet module to extract
structure-aware latent features, cCNF Prior module to learn the distribution of
the latent features controlled by the part adjacency, and Diffusion Transformer
module conditioned on the latent features and part adjacency to generate
structure-consistent point cloud shapes. Experimental results demonstrate that
our structure-controllable 3D point cloud generation method produces
high-quality and diverse point cloud shapes, enabling the generation of
controllable point clouds based on user-specified shape structures and
achieving state-of-the-art performance in controllable point cloud generation
on the ShapeNet dataset.

*Zhenyu Shu,Jiawei Wen,Shiyang Li,Shiqing Xin,Ligang Liu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diff-3DCap, a method for 3D shape captioning using a diffusion model and projected views rather than voxel representations or object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches to 3D captioning depend on costly voxel representations or object detection methods, often yielding suboptimal results. The study aims to address these limitations.

Method: The proposed method, Diff-3DCap, uses a sequence of projected 3D object views and a continuous diffusion model to generate captions. Captions are perturbed with Gaussian noise in the forward phase and reconstructed in the reverse phase, using embeddings from a pre-trained visual-language model.

Result: Experimental results show that Diff-3DCap achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in 3D shape captioning.

Conclusion: Diff-3DCap provides an effective alternative to traditional approaches by leveraging diffusion models and pre-trained embeddings, simplifying the process and maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: The task of 3D shape captioning occupies a significant place within the
domain of computer graphics and has garnered considerable interest in recent
years. Traditional approaches to this challenge frequently depend on the
utilization of costly voxel representations or object detection techniques, yet
often fail to deliver satisfactory outcomes. To address the above challenges,
in this paper, we introduce Diff-3DCap, which employs a sequence of projected
views to represent a 3D object and a continuous diffusion model to facilitate
the captioning process. More precisely, our approach utilizes the continuous
diffusion model to perturb the embedded captions during the forward phase by
introducing Gaussian noise and then predicts the reconstructed annotation
during the reverse phase. Embedded within the diffusion framework is a
commitment to leveraging a visual embedding obtained from a pre-trained
visual-language model, which naturally allows the embedding to serve as a
guiding signal, eliminating the need for an additional classifier. Extensive
results of our experiments indicate that Diff-3DCap can achieve performance
comparable to that of the current state-of-the-art methods.

### [1367] [ReLumix: Extending Image Relighting to Video via Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23769)
*Lezhong Wang,Shutong Jin,Ruiqi Cui,Anders Bjorholm Dahl,Jeppe Revall Frisvad,Siavash Bigdeli*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ReLumix is a framework enabling flexible and seamless video relighting by applying any image relighting technique to a reference frame and propagating it through a sequence using a temporal synthesis model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video relighting methods are inflexible, constraining users to specific relighting models, and lack effective adaptation to dynamic lighting control.

Method: The process involves a two-stage framework: relighting a single reference frame using any image-based technique, followed by applying the fine-tuned stable video diffusion model to propagate changes through the video. Enhancements like a gated cross-attention mechanism and temporal bootstrapping ensure coherence and prevent artifacts.

Result: ReLumix achieves competitive performance on both synthetic and real-world videos, significantly improving visual fidelity and temporal coherence.

Conclusion: ReLumix offers a scalable, versatile solution for video relighting, allowing seamless incorporation of diverse relighting techniques while ensuring quality and adaptability.

Abstract: Controlling illumination during video post-production is a crucial yet
elusive goal in computational photography. Existing methods often lack
flexibility, restricting users to certain relighting models. This paper
introduces ReLumix, a novel framework that decouples the relighting algorithm
from temporal synthesis, thereby enabling any image relighting technique to be
seamlessly applied to video. Our approach reformulates video relighting into a
simple yet effective two-stage process: (1) an artist relights a single
reference frame using any preferred image-based technique (e.g., Diffusion
Models, physics-based renderers); and (2) a fine-tuned stable video diffusion
(SVD) model seamlessly propagates this target illumination throughout the
sequence. To ensure temporal coherence and prevent artifacts, we introduce a
gated cross-attention mechanism for smooth feature blending and a temporal
bootstrapping strategy that harnesses SVD's powerful motion priors. Although
trained on synthetic data, ReLumix shows competitive generalization to
real-world videos. The method demonstrates significant improvements in visual
fidelity, offering a scalable and versatile solution for dynamic lighting
control.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper presents a new method for determining point visibility in 3D point clouds using a combination of 3D U-Net and MLP, significantly surpassing traditional approaches like HPR in efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in visibility determination of sparse point clouds due to their lack of explicit connectivity and the limitations of existing methods like HPR.

Method: A 3D U-Net extracts view-independent point-wise features, and an MLP predicts point visibility using these features and view direction. The network is trained using ground-truth visibility labels from rendered 3D models.

Result: The proposed method achieves up to 126x speedup compared to HPR, improved visibility accuracy, and showcases robustness to noise, varying point densities, and unseen shapes.

Conclusion: The method is highly effective, generalizing well across datasets and proving versatile in applications like visualization, surface reconstruction, and viewpoint optimization. The code is publicly available for further use.

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used representations of 3D data, but determining the
visibility of points from a given viewpoint remains a challenging problem due
to their sparse nature and lack of explicit connectivity. Traditional methods,
such as Hidden Point Removal (HPR), face limitations in computational
efficiency, robustness to noise, and handling concave regions or low-density
point clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to visibility
determination in point clouds by formulating it as a binary classification
task. The core of our network consists of a 3D U-Net that extracts
view-independent point-wise features and a shared multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
that predicts point visibility using the extracted features and view direction
as inputs. The network is trained end-to-end with ground-truth visibility
labels generated from rendered 3D models. Our method significantly outperforms
HPR in both accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving up to 126 times
speedup on large point clouds. Additionally, our network demonstrates
robustness to noise and varying point cloud densities and generalizes well to
unseen shapes. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive
experiments on the ShapeNet, ABC Dataset and real-world datasets, showing
substantial improvements in visibility accuracy. We also demonstrate the
versatility of our method in various applications, including point cloud
visualization, surface reconstruction, normal estimation, shadow rendering, and
viewpoint optimization. Our code and models are available at

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Light-SQ, an optimization framework for compact, editable 3D shape abstraction using superquadrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in user-generated-content applications where non-expert users rely on generative models for creating 3D assets. The work aims to provide structure-aware shape abstraction suitable for these users.

Method: Light-SQ employs three main strategies: SDF carving to reduce primitive overlap, a block-regrow-fill method for part-aware alignment, and adaptive residual pruning to avoid over-segmentation. Additionally, it supports multiscale fitting for preserving geometric details.

Result: The Light-SQ framework was tested using the 3DGen-Prim benchmark, demonstrating its ability to efficiently and accurately abstract complex 3D shapes into editable representations.

Conclusion: Light-SQ advances the practicality of 3D UGC creation, offering efficient, high-fidelity editable shape abstractions suitable for non-expert usage.

Abstract: In user-generated-content (UGC) applications, non-expert users often rely on
image-to-3D generative models to create 3D assets. In this context,
primitive-based shape abstraction offers a promising solution for UGC scenarios
by compressing high-resolution meshes into compact, editable representations.
Towards this end, effective shape abstraction must therefore be
structure-aware, characterized by low overlap between primitives, part-aware
alignment, and primitive compactness. We present Light-SQ, a novel
superquadric-based optimization framework that explicitly emphasizes
structure-awareness from three aspects. (a) We introduce SDF carving to
iteratively udpate the target signed distance field, discouraging overlap
between primitives. (b) We propose a block-regrow-fill strategy guided by
structure-aware volumetric decomposition, enabling structural partitioning to
drive primitive placement. (c) We implement adaptive residual pruning based on
SDF update history to surpress over-segmentation and ensure compact results. In
addition, Light-SQ supports multiscale fitting, enabling localized refinement
to preserve fine geometric details. To evaluate our method, we introduce
3DGen-Prim, a benchmark extending 3DGen-Bench with new metrics for both
reconstruction quality and primitive-level editability. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Light-SQ enables efficient, high-fidelity, and editable shape
abstraction with superquadrics for complex generated geometry, advancing the
feasibility of 3D UGC creation.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: CharGen is a system for editing character images that balances control, speed, and visual quality through Concept Sliders and a novel sampling and repair method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of balancing control, speed, and image fidelity when interactively editing character images with diffusion models.

Method: The method combines Concept Sliders for attribute-specific editing with the StreamDiffusion pipeline for quick generation, incorporating a Repair Step to maintain texture and structural consistency.

Result: CharGen outperforms alternatives like InstructPix2Pix and Google Gemini in speed (2-4x faster), editing precision, and maintaining character identity, as demonstrated through ablation and user studies.

Conclusion: CharGen offers effective, fast, and precise control for interactive character image editing, improving on existing methodologies.

Abstract: Interactive editing of character images with diffusion models remains
challenging due to the inherent trade-off between fine-grained control,
generation speed, and visual fidelity. We introduce CharGen, a
character-focused editor that combines attribute-specific Concept Sliders,
trained to isolate and manipulate attributes such as facial feature size,
expression, and decoration with the StreamDiffusion sampling pipeline for more
interactive performance. To counteract the loss of detail that often
accompanies accelerated sampling, we propose a lightweight Repair Step that
reinstates fine textures without compromising structural consistency.
Throughout extensive ablation studies and in comparison to open-source
InstructPix2Pix and closed-source Google Gemini, and a comprehensive user
study, CharGen achieves two-to-four-fold faster edit turnaround with precise
editing control and identity-consistent results. Project page:

*AmirHossein Zamani,Bruno Roy,Arianna Rampini*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper presents an unsupervised framework for automating 3D mesh parameterization that incorporates semantic and visibility awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional UV mapping requires manual work, creating a bottleneck for asset creation in 3D generative modeling, especially lacking semantic and visibility considerations.

Method: The method segments 3D meshes into parts, applies unsupervised per-part UV parameterization, aggregates them into a unified UV atlas, and uses ambient occlusion for visibility-aware seam cutting.

Result: The proposed framework creates UV atlases that improve texture generation quality and minimize visible seam artifacts better than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The method effectively automates UV mapping, addressing semantic and visibility awareness issues while outperforming existing approaches in generating high-quality texture-ready 3D mesh UV atlases.

Abstract: Recent 3D generative models produce high-quality textures for 3D mesh
objects. However, they commonly rely on the heavy assumption that input 3D
meshes are accompanied by manual mesh parameterization (UV mapping), a manual
task that requires both technical precision and artistic judgment. Industry
surveys show that this process often accounts for a significant share of asset
creation, creating a major bottleneck for 3D content creators. Moreover,
existing automatic methods often ignore two perceptually important criteria:
(1) semantic awareness (UV charts should align semantically similar 3D parts
across shapes) and (2) visibility awareness (cutting seams should lie in
regions unlikely to be seen). To overcome these shortcomings and to automate
the mesh parameterization process, we present an unsupervised differentiable
framework that augments standard geometry-preserving UV learning with semantic-
and visibility-aware objectives. For semantic-awareness, our pipeline (i)
segments the mesh into semantic 3D parts, (ii) applies an unsupervised learned
per-part UV-parameterization backbone, and (iii) aggregates per-part charts
into a unified UV atlas. For visibility-awareness, we use ambient occlusion
(AO) as an exposure proxy and back-propagate a soft differentiable AO-weighted
seam objective to steer cutting seams toward occluded regions. By conducting
qualitative and quantitative evaluations against state-of-the-art methods, we
show that the proposed method produces UV atlases that better support texture
generation and reduce perceptible seam artifacts compared to recent baselines.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces LayerD, a method to decompose raster images into editable layers for graphic design workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designers need re-editable workflows in graphic design, but raster images lack the layer-based editing functionality.

Method: LayerD iteratively extracts unoccluded foreground layers and employs a refinement strategy based on the uniform appearance of layers. It also introduces a quality metric for evaluation since ground truth is unreliable.

Result: Experiments show LayerD achieves high-quality layer decomposition and outperforms baseline methods.

Conclusion: LayerD enables re-editable creative workflows by successfully decomposing raster images into layers, supporting modern image generation and editing techniques.

Abstract: Designers craft and edit graphic designs in a layer representation, but
layer-based editing becomes impossible once composited into a raster image. In
this work, we propose LayerD, a method to decompose raster graphic designs into
layers for re-editable creative workflow. LayerD addresses the decomposition
task by iteratively extracting unoccluded foreground layers. We propose a
simple yet effective refinement approach taking advantage of the assumption
that layers often exhibit uniform appearance in graphic designs. As
decomposition is ill-posed and the ground-truth layer structure may not be
reliable, we develop a quality metric that addresses the difficulty. In
experiments, we show that LayerD successfully achieves high-quality
decomposition and outperforms baselines. We also demonstrate the use of LayerD
with state-of-the-art image generators and layer-based editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackling online misinformation, which is exacerbated by open internet platforms and advanced large language models (LLMs), often fails to consider the holistic interplay of site content and hyperlinks.

Method: CrediBench constructs temporal web graphs combining textual content and hyperlink structures, enabling dynamic evaluation of misinformation through a large-scale dataset.

Result: CrediBench processed December 2024's Common Crawl data into a dataset with 45 million nodes and 1 billion edges, showcasing the importance of combined structural and content signals in measuring credibility.

Conclusion: This work sets a foundation for advanced misinformation detection by fusing webpage content with network structure and offers valuable public resources to further research.

Abstract: Online misinformation poses an escalating threat, amplified by the Internet's
open nature and increasingly capable LLMs that generate persuasive yet
deceptive content. Existing misinformation detection methods typically focus on
either textual content or network structure in isolation, failing to leverage
the rich, dynamic interplay between website content and hyperlink relationships
that characterizes real-world misinformation ecosystems. We introduce
CrediBench: a large-scale data processing pipeline for constructing temporal
web graphs that jointly model textual content and hyperlink structure for
misinformation detection. Unlike prior work, our approach captures the dynamic
evolution of general misinformation domains, including changes in both content
and inter-site references over time. Our processed one-month snapshot extracted
from the Common Crawl archive in December 2024 contains 45 million nodes and 1
billion edges, representing the largest web graph dataset made publicly
available for misinformation research to date. From our experiments on this
graph snapshot, we demonstrate the strength of both structural and webpage
content signals for learning credibility scores, which measure source
reliability. The pipeline and experimentation code are all available here, and

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the robustness of six GNN architectures against node attribute manipulations, edge distortions, and adversarial attacks in community detection, showing trade-offs between accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the robustness of GNNs in community detection tasks under different perturbations and targeted attacks.

Method: Systematic computational evaluation was performed on six GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, Graph-SAGE, DiffPool, MinCUT, and DMoN), using synthetic and real-world datasets, with three categories of perturbations analyzed.

Result: Supervised GNNs show high baseline accuracy, but unsupervised models like DMoN demonstrate stronger resilience to perturbations. Community strength influences robustness, with targeted attribute and edge perturbations causing the most degradation.

Conclusion: There exists a trade-off between accuracy and robustness in GNN-based community detection, and the study offers insights into selecting architectures for improved resilience.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly widely used for community
detection in attributed networks. They combine structural topology with node
attributes through message passing and pooling. However, their robustness or
lack of thereof with respect to different perturbations and targeted attacks in
conjunction with community detection tasks is not well understood. To shed
light into latent mechanisms behind GNN sensitivity on community detection
tasks, we conduct a systematic computational evaluation of six widely adopted
GNN architectures: GCN, GAT, Graph-SAGE, DiffPool, MinCUT, and DMoN. The
analysis covers three perturbation categories: node attribute manipulations,
edge topology distortions, and adversarial attacks. We use element-centric
similarity as the evaluation metric on synthetic benchmarks and real-world
citation networks. Our findings indicate that supervised GNNs tend to achieve
higher baseline accuracy, while unsupervised methods, particularly DMoN,
maintain stronger resilience under targeted and adversarial perturbations.
Furthermore, robustness appears to be strongly influenced by community
strength, with well-defined communities reducing performance loss. Across all
models, node attribute perturbations associated with targeted edge deletions
and shift in attribute distributions tend to cause the largest degradation in
community recovery. These findings highlight important trade-offs between
accuracy and robustness in GNN-based community detection and offer new insights
into selecting architectures resilient to noise and adversarial attacks.

Result: Empirical tests on real-world datasets confirmed higher detection accuracy and dynamic adjustment of community count compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The study successfully improves the Louvain algorithm through GNN integration, offering a novel and effective approach to community detection.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel community detection method that integrates the
Louvain algorithm with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), enabling the discovery of
communities without prior knowledge. Compared to most existing solutions, the
proposed method does not require prior knowledge of the number of communities.
It enhances the Louvain algorithm using node embeddings generated by a GNN to
capture richer structural and feature information. Furthermore, it introduces a
merging algorithm to refine the results of the enhanced Louvain algorithm,
reducing the number of detected communities. To the best of our knowledge, this
work is the first one that improves the Louvain algorithm using GNNs for
community detection. The improvement of the proposed method was empirically
confirmed through an evaluation on real-world datasets. The results demonstrate
its ability to dynamically adjust the number of detected communities and
increase the detection accuracy in comparison with the benchmark solutions.

### [1376] [Node Classification via Simplicial Interaction with Augmented Maximal Clique Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23568)
*Eunho Koo,Tongseok Lim*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an augmented maximal clique strategy to address inefficiencies and imbalances in using maximal cliques for modeling higher-order network interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods leveraging pairwise interactions or all cliques in networks face computational and imbalance issues, necessitating more efficient yet comprehensive approaches.

Method: The authors developed an augmented maximal clique approach, selectively including non-maximal cliques to balance node representation while maintaining computational efficiency.

Result: The proposed method outperformed traditional techniques on synthetic and real-world datasets in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Augmented maximal cliques provide an effective and scalable solution for incorporating higher-order structures in network-based learning, enhancing GNN performance.

Abstract: Considering higher-order interactions allows for a more comprehensive
understanding of network structures beyond simple pairwise connections. While
leveraging all cliques in a network to handle higher-order interactions is
intuitive, it often leads to computational inefficiencies due to overlapping
information between higher-order and lower-order cliques. To address this
issue, we propose an augmented maximal clique strategy. Although using only
maximal cliques can reduce unnecessary overlap and provide a concise
representation of the network, certain nodes may still appear in multiple
maximal cliques, resulting in imbalanced training data. Therefore, our
augmented maximal clique approach selectively includes some non-maximal cliques
to mitigate the overrepresentation of specific nodes and promote more balanced
learning across the network. Comparative analyses on synthetic networks and
real-world citation datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms approaches
based on pairwise interactions, all cliques, or only maximal cliques. Finally,
by integrating this strategy into GNN-based semi-supervised learning, we
establish a link between maximal clique-based methods and GNNs, showing that
incorporating higher-order structures improves predictive accuracy. As a
result, the augmented maximal clique strategy offers a computationally
efficient and effective solution for higher-order network learning.

*Keisuke Otaki,Akihisa Okada,Tadayoshi Matsumori,Hiroaki Yoshida*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving geofence design by using arbitrary shapes derived from human mobility data, replacing traditional circular geofences for better accuracy and alignment with urban layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of circular geofences, which lack flexibility and alignment with urban features, and to explore automated geofence design using human mobility data.

Method: The authors reformulated the geofence design problem as a 0-1 integer programming challenge and solved it efficiently by converting it into quadratic binary optimization problems, leveraging specialized solvers like quantum annealing.

Result: The proposed modeling approach allowed for the creation of geofences with arbitrary shapes, demonstrating enhanced flexibility and adaptability for high-resolution or urban regions.

Conclusion: Through advanced formulations and novel optimization techniques, flexible and accurate geofence designs can replace traditional methods, enabling better alignment with diverse requirements.

Abstract: Geofences have attracted significant attention in the design of spatial and
virtual regions for managing and engaging spatiotemporal events. By using
geofences to monitor human activity across their boundaries, content providers
can create spatially triggered events that include notifications about points
of interest within a geofence by pushing spatial information to the devices of
users. Traditionally, geofences were hand-crafted by providers. In addition to
the hand-crafted approach, recent advances in collecting human mobility data
through mobile devices can accelerate the automatic and data-driven design of
geofences, also known as the geofence design problem. Previous approaches
assume circular shapes; thus, their flexibility is insufficient, and they can
only handle geofence-based applications for large areas with coarse
resolutions. A challenge with using circular geofences in urban and
high-resolution areas is that they often overlap and fail to align with
political district boundaries and road segments, such as one-way streets and
median barriers. In this study, we address the problem of extracting arbitrary
shapes as geofences from human mobility data to mitigate this problem. In our
formulation, we cast the existing optimization problems for circular geofences
to 0-1 integer programming problems to represent arbitrary shapes. Although 0-1
integer programming problems are computationally hard, formulating them as
quadratic (unconstrained) binary optimization problems enables efficient
approximation of optimal solutions, because this allows the use of specialized
quadratic solvers, such as the quantum annealing, and other state-of-the-art
algorithms. We then develop and compare different formulation methods to
extract discrete geofences. We confirmed that our new modeling approach enables
flexible geofence design.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: This paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN) model to improve the efficiency and accuracy of non-Newtonian fluid simulations, leveraging smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional algorithms struggle with non-Newtonian fluids due to dynamic viscosity changes and free surface flow complexities, creating a need for efficient computational methods.

Method: A GNN-based numerical model is trained on SPH simulation data to predict flow behavior in non-Newtonian power-law fluids, focusing on parameters affecting particle accelerations and interactions.

Result: The GNN model significantly speeds up computations while maintaining high accuracy, validated through benchmark tests like dam-break and droplet impact simulations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of GNN-based frameworks for advancing non-Newtonian fluid simulations, highlighting efficient and reliable methodologies for future applications.

Abstract: In this study, we propose a graph neural network (GNN) model for efficiently
predicting the flow behavior of non-Newtonian fluids with free surface
dynamics. The numerical analysis of non-Newtonian fluids presents significant
challenges, as traditional algorithms designed for Newtonian fluids with
constant viscosity often struggle to converge when applied to non-Newtonian
cases, where rheological properties vary dynamically with flow conditions.
Among these, power-law fluids exhibit viscosity that decreases exponentially as
the shear rate increases, making numerical simulations particularly difficult.
The complexity further escalates in free surface flow scenarios, where
computational challenges intensify. In such cases, particle-based methods like
smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) provide advantages over traditional
grid-based techniques, such as the finite element method (FEM). Building on
this approach, we introduce a novel GNN-based numerical model to enhance the
computational efficiency of non-Newtonian power-law fluid flow simulations. Our
model is trained on SPH simulation data, learning the effects of particle
accelerations in the presence of SPH interactions based on the fluid's
power-law parameters. The GNN significantly accelerates computations while
maintaining reliable accuracy in benchmark tests, including dam-break and
droplet impact simulations. The results underscore the potential of GNN-based
simulation frameworks for efficiently modeling non-Newtonian fluid behavior,
paving the way for future advancements in data-driven fluid simulations.

Main category: physics.hist-ph

TL;DR: The paper formalizes scientific concept formation using type theory, focusing on Einstein's discoveries to establish cognitive typing rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and formalize how scientific concepts are created during theoretical physics breakthroughs using computational models.

Method: Introduces type theory as a framework and applies cognitive typing rules to analyze Einstein's reasoning on physical phenomena.

Result: Developed compositional typing rules for scientific discovery mechanisms and computationally modeled Einstein's concept of relativity of time.

Conclusion: Scientific concept discovery can be formalized effectively using type theory, opening pathways for computational representation of scientific reasoning.

Abstract: This work aims to formalize some of the ways scientific concepts are formed
in the process of theoretical physics discovery. Since this may at first seem
like a task beyond the scope of the exact sciences (natural and formal
sciences), we begin by presenting arguments for why scientific concept
formation can be formalized. Then, we introduce type theory as a natural and
well-suited framework for this formalization. We formalize what we call "ways
of discovering new concepts" including concept distinction, property
preservation, and concept change, as cognitive typing rules. Next, we apply
these cognitive typing rules to two case studies of conceptual discovery in the
history of physics: Einstein's reasoning leading to the impossibility of frozen
waves, and his conceptual path to the relativity of time. In these historical
episodes, we recast what a physicist might informally call "ways of discovering
new scientific concepts" as compositional typing rules built from cognitive
typing rules - thus formalizing them as scientific discovery mechanisms.
Lastly, we computationally model the type-theoretic reconstruction of
Einstein's conceptual path to the relativity of time as a program synthesis
task.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper explores prediction-powered communication in 6G wireless systems using AI-based predictors to achieve zero-delay data transmission with strict distortion guarantees, introducing new compression algorithms for robust, task-oriented communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The emergence of 6G wireless systems and AI-equipped devices necessitate a rethinking of traditional Shannon information theory to support semantic and task-oriented communication paradigms under stringent technological demands.

Method: The paper introduces two zero-delay compression algorithms based on online conformal prediction to ensure sequence-level distortion guarantees for both error-free and erasure channels, with adaptations to handle channel-induced errors.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrate significant reductions in bit rates while maintaining strict distortion guarantees in experiments on semantic text compression, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The work presents a promising approach for enabling reliable, efficient, and task-specific communication in next-generation wireless systems.

Abstract: The development of 6G wireless systems is taking place alongside the
development of increasingly intelligent wireless devices and network nodes. The
changing technological landscape is motivating a rethinking of classical
Shannon information theory that emphasizes semantic and task-oriented
paradigms. In this paper, we study a prediction-powered communication setting,
in which devices, equipped with artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictors,
communicate under zero-delay constraints with strict distortion guarantees. Two
classes of distortion measures are considered: (i) outage-based metrics,
suitable for tasks tolerating occasional packet losses, such as real-time
control or monitoring; and (ii) bounded distortion metrics, relevant to
semantic-rich tasks like text or video transmission. We propose two zero-delay
compression algorithms leveraging online conformal prediction to provide
per-sequence guarantees on the distortion of reconstructed sequences over
error-free and packet-erasure channels with feedback. For erasure channels, we
introduce a doubly-adaptive conformal update to compensate for channel-induced
errors and derive sufficient conditions on erasure statistics to ensure
distortion constraints. Experiments on semantic text compression validate the
approach, showing significant bit rate reductions while strictly meeting
distortion guarantees compared to state-of-the-art prediction-powered
compression methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces spatially parallel all-optical neural networks (SP-AONNs) as a new strategy, overcoming the limitations of traditional series architecture in energy-efficient neural computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address issues in traditional series-based all-optical neural networks, such as signal degradation and the need for additional nonlinear components, thereby enhancing ultrafast and energy-efficient computing.

Method: They propose spatially parallel architectures (SP-AONNs) that divide input signals into identical copies fed into parallel optical layers, utilizing coherent interference for intrinsic nonlinear computation.

Result: The SP-AONNs showed improved performance in image classification tasks, demonstrating enhanced accuracy, noise robustness, and model expressivity as the number of parallel sub-networks increased.

Conclusion: Spatial parallelism is a scalable and practical approach, capable of advancing all-optical neural networks by addressing the limitations of existing spatially series architectures.

Abstract: All-optical neural networks (AONNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for
ultrafast and energy-efficient computation. These networks typically consist of
multiple serially connected layers between input and output layers--a
configuration we term spatially series AONNs, with deep neural networks (DNNs)
being the most prominent examples. However, such series architectures suffer
from progressive signal degradation during information propagation and
critically require additional nonlinearity designs to model complex
relationships effectively. Here we propose a spatially parallel architecture
for all-optical neural networks (SP-AONNs). Unlike series architecture that
sequentially processes information through consecutively connected optical
layers, SP-AONNs divide the input signal into identical copies fed
simultaneously into separate optical layers. Through coherent interference
between these parallel linear sub-networks, SP-AONNs inherently enable
nonlinear computation without relying on active nonlinear components or
iterative updates. We implemented a modular 4F optical system for SP-AONNs and
evaluated its performance across multiple image classification benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that increasing the number of parallel
sub-networks consistently enhances accuracy, improves noise robustness, and
expands model expressivity. Our findings highlight spatial parallelism as a
practical and scalable strategy for advancing the capabilities of optical
neural computing.

TL;DR: This paper explores using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for metasurface design, offering a faster and more user-friendly alternative to traditional simulation-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing metasurfaces is computationally challenging due to the need for in-depth simulations, which limits the exploration of complex configurations. A simpler, rapid approach is needed.

Method: The authors utilized pre-trained LLMs fine-tuned to predict spectral outputs and enable inverse metasurface design, using descriptive inputs about geometry.

Result: The study successfully applied LLMs for fast and accurate spectral predictions and design of 2D arbitrarily shaped metasurfaces, benchmarking multiple LLMs for performance across different model sizes.

Conclusion: Pre-trained LLMs offer a promising, practical tool for metasurface design, enabling easier and faster workflows through natural language interaction with electromagnetic modeling.

Abstract: Traditional metasurface design is limited by the computational cost of
full-wave simulations, preventing thorough exploration of complex
configurations. Data-driven approaches have emerged as a solution to this
bottleneck, replacing costly simulations with rapid neural network evaluations
and enabling near-instant design for meta-atoms. Despite advances, implementing
a new optical function still requires building and training a task-specific
network, along with exhaustive searches for suitable architectures and
hyperparameters. Pre-trained large language models (LLMs), by contrast,
sidestep this laborious process with a simple fine-tuning technique. However,
applying LLMs to the design of nanophotonic devices, particularly for
arbitrarily shaped metasurfaces, is still in its early stages; as such tasks
often require graphical networks. Here, we show that an LLM, fed with
descriptive inputs of arbitrarily shaped metasurface geometries, can learn the
physical relationships needed for spectral prediction and inverse design. We
further benchmarked a range of open-weight LLMs and identified relationships
between accuracy and model size at the billion-parameter level. We demonstrated
that 1-D token-wise LLMs provide a practical tool to designing 2-D arbitrarily
shaped metasurfaces. Linking natural-language interaction to electromagnetic
modelling, this "chat-to-chip" workflow represents a step toward more
user-friendly data-driven nanophotonics.

*Artavazd Maranjyan,Peter Richtárik*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ringleader ASGD, an asynchronous stochastic gradient descent method optimized for heterogeneous device speeds and data distributions in federated learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current asynchronous SGD methods are challenged by heterogeneous settings, such as diverse data distributions and varying computation speeds, which are common in federated learning contexts.

Method: The authors propose Ringleader ASGD, an algorithm designed to eliminate restrictive assumptions about worker data similarity and ensure optimal time complexity under nonconvex smooth settings.

Result: Ringleader ASGD meets theoretical lower bounds for time complexity in asynchronous optimization and performs optimally even with arbitrary or varying worker speeds.

Conclusion: Ringleader ASGD bridges theoretical gaps in asynchronous SGD, making it suitable for real-world federated learning scenarios with heterogeneous devices and data.

Abstract: Asynchronous stochastic gradient methods are central to scalable distributed
optimization, particularly when devices differ in computational capabilities.
Such settings arise naturally in federated learning, where training takes place
on smartphones and other heterogeneous edge devices. In addition to varying
computation speeds, these devices often hold data from different distributions.
However, existing asynchronous SGD methods struggle in such heterogeneous
settings and face two key limitations. First, many rely on unrealistic
assumptions of similarity across workers' data distributions. Second, methods
that relax this assumption still fail to achieve theoretically optimal
performance under heterogeneous computation times. We introduce Ringleader
ASGD, the first asynchronous SGD algorithm that attains the theoretical lower
bounds for parallel first-order stochastic methods in the smooth nonconvex
regime, thereby achieving optimal time complexity under data heterogeneity and
without restrictive similarity assumptions. Our analysis further establishes
that Ringleader ASGD remains optimal under arbitrary and even time-varying
worker computation speeds, closing a fundamental gap in the theory of
asynchronous optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Normalization methods in MCDM significantly influence the reliability of rankings, with current practice relying on ad-hoc selections without systematic evaluations.

Method: The authors propose a framework using Scikit-Criteria infrastructure to automate exploration of scaling transformations and generate all possible method combinations for robust analysis.

Result: The automated framework enables systematic evaluation and comparative analysis of various normalization methods in MCDM, potentially addressing methodological uncertainties.

Conclusion: This framework provides an automated and robust solution to enhance reliability in MCDM rankings by resolving uncertainties related to normalization techniques.

Abstract: Multicriteria decision-making methods exhibit critical dependence on the
choice of normalization techniques, where different selections can alter 20-40%
of the final rankings. Current practice is characterized by the ad-hoc
selection of methods without systematic robustness evaluation. We present a
framework that addresses this methodological uncertainty through automated

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks in MIP optimization studies, which has resulted in data leakage, over-optimistic claims, and inconsistent results.

Method: The authors propose BenLOC, an open-source toolkit that provides a comprehensive pipeline for learning instance-wise MIP configurations. It standardizes key aspects of evaluation such as dataset selection, train-test splits, feature engineering, and baselines.

Result: Using BenLOC, the authors perform empirical analysis on five MIP datasets and compare classical machine learning models with state-of-the-art deep-learning techniques. Their findings highlight the significance of standardized datasets, features, and baseline criteria.

Conclusion: BenLOC is effective in delivering unbiased and thorough evaluations for MIP optimizers, addressing prior shortcomings in the field.

Abstract: The automatic configuration of Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) optimizers has
become increasingly critical as the large number of configurations can
significantly affect solver performance. Yet the lack of standardized
evaluation frameworks has led to data leakage and over-optimistic claims, as
prior studies often rely on homogeneous datasets and inconsistent experimental
setups. To promote a fair evaluation process, we present BenLOC, a
comprehensive benchmark and open-source toolkit, which not only offers an
end-to-end pipeline for learning instance-wise MIP optimizer configurations,
but also standardizes dataset selection, train-test splits, feature engineering
and baseline choice for unbiased and comprehensive evaluations. Leveraging this
framework, we conduct an empirical analysis on five well-established MIP
datasets and compare classical machine learning models with handcrafted
features against state-of-the-art deep-learning techniques. The results
demonstrate the importance of datasets, features and baseline criteria proposed
by BenLOC and the effectiveness of BenLOC in providing unbiased and

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for approximating data distributions using mixtures modeled as a semi-algebraic set, introducing semidefinite relaxations for improved solution accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in determining the mixture order and estimating parameters in high-dimensional mixture models, especially for complex data distributions.

Method: A hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations is introduced, enabling optimal parameter approximation without assuming a finite parameter set, modeled as a compact semi-algebraic set.

Result: The proposed approach ensures asymptotic convergence and even finite convergence under certain rank conditions, while providing applications in clustering.

Conclusion: The framework is both accurate and versatile, offering tools for clustering tasks that improve initial estimates and speed up convergence for conventional algorithms.

Abstract: Mixture models, such as Gaussian mixture models, are widely used in machine
learning to represent complex data distributions. A key challenge, especially
in high-dimensional settings, is to determine the mixture order and estimate
the mixture parameters. We study the problem of approximating a target measure,
available only through finitely many of its moments, by a mixture of
distributions from a parametric family (e.g., Gaussian, exponential, Poisson),
with approximation quality measured by the 2-Wasserstein or the total variation
distance. Unlike many existing approaches, the parameter set is not assumed to
be finite; it is modeled as a compact basic semi-algebraic set. We introduce a
hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations with asymptotic convergence to the
desired optimal value. In addition, when a certain rank condition is satisfied,
the convergence is even finite and recovery of an optimal mixing measure is
obtained. We also present an application to clustering, where our framework
serves either as a stand-alone method or as a preprocessing step that yields
both the number of clusters and strong initial parameter estimates, thereby
accelerating convergence of standard (local) clustering algorithms.

TL;DR: The paper discusses optimal diagonal preconditioning approaches to improve optimization tasks and condition numbers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently minimize condition numbers in optimization tasks using diagonal preconditioning.

Method: They reformulate optimization problems into affine-based pseudoconvex forms and introduce competitive subgradient methods.

Result: Better scaling, efficiency, and performance for PCG methods compared to SDP-based approaches.

Conclusion: Proposed methods improve preconditioning efficiency and PCG results.

Abstract: Preconditioning (scaling) is essential in many areas of mathematics, and in
particular in optimization. In this work, we study the problem of finding an
optimal diagonal preconditioner. We focus on minimizing two different notions
of condition number: the classical, worst-case type, $\kappa$-condition number,
and the more averaging motivated $\omega$-condition number. We provide affine
based pseudoconvex reformulations of both optimization problems. The advantage
of our formulations is that the gradient of the objective is inexpensive to
compute and the optimization variable is just an $n\times 1$ vector. We also
provide elegant characterizations of the optimality conditions of both
problems.
  We develop a competitive subgradient method, with convergence guarantees, for
$\kappa$-optimal diagonal preconditioning that scales much better and is more
efficient than existing SDP-based approaches. We also show that the
preconditioners found by our subgradient method leads to better PCG performance
for solving linear systems than other approaches. Finally, we show the
interesting phenomenon that we can apply the $\omega$-optimal preconditioner to
the exact $\kappa$-optimally diagonally preconditioned matrix $A$ and get
consistent, significantly improved convergence results for PCG methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of the traditional Bundle Method in convex non-smooth minimization, specifically its reliance on heuristic tuning of parameters and iterative optimizations.

Method: The method involves replacing standard optimization techniques with a recurrent neural network incorporating attention mechanisms and training the resulting Bundle Network end-to-end via automatic differentiation.

Result: Experiments on Lagrangian dual relaxations for specific problems showed the Bundle Network outperforms traditional tuning methods and generalizes well across datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed Bundle Network provides an effective and automated alternative to traditional methods in solving convex non-smooth problems, eliminating manual parameter tuning and improving performance.

Abstract: This paper presents Bundle Network, a learning-based algorithm inspired by
the Bundle Method for convex non-smooth minimization problems. Unlike classical
approaches that rely on heuristic tuning of a regularization parameter, our
method automatically learns to adjust it from data. Furthermore, we replace the
iterative resolution of the optimization problem that provides the search
direction-traditionally computed as a convex combination of gradients at
visited points-with a recurrent neural model equipped with an attention
mechanism. By leveraging the unrolled graph of computation, our Bundle Network
can be trained end-to-end via automatic differentiation. Experiments on
Lagrangian dual relaxations of the Multi-Commodity Network Design and
Generalized Assignment problems demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms traditional methods relying on grid search for parameter tuning,

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approximation for the LogSumExp function that is computationally efficient and preserves convexity, addressing challenges in optimization problems like DRO and optimal transport.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in overcoming computational challenges posed by the large number of exponential terms in the LogSumExp function, which can make gradient evaluation intractable while avoiding biases introduced by existing stochastic approximation methods.

Method: The authors developed a new $f$-divergence called the safe KL divergence by modifying the KL divergence in the dual space. The resulting approximation maintains convexity, allows tunable accuracy, and scales well with smoothness constants.

Result: The proposed approximation demonstrated computational efficiency, scalability, and improved numerical stability in experiments on DRO and continuous optimal transport when compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: This novel approximation enables efficient and accurate optimization in problems involving LogSumExp, addressing both computational and numerical issues while preserving the underlying mathematical structure.

Abstract: The LogSumExp function, also known as the free energy, plays a central role
in many important optimization problems, including entropy-regularized optimal
transport and distributionally robust optimization (DRO). It is also the dual
to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which is widely used in machine
learning. In practice, when the number of exponential terms inside the
logarithm is large or infinite, optimization becomes challenging since
computing the gradient requires differentiating every term. Previous approaches
that replace the full sum with a small batch introduce significant bias. We
propose a novel approximation to LogSumExp that can be efficiently optimized
using stochastic gradient methods. This approximation is rooted in a sound
modification of the KL divergence in the dual, resulting in a new
$f$-divergence called the safe KL divergence. The accuracy of the approximation
is controlled by a tunable parameter and can be made arbitrarily small. Like
the LogSumExp, our approximation preserves convexity. Moreover, when applied to
an $L$-smooth function bounded from below, the smoothness constant of the
resulting objective scales linearly with $L$. Experiments in DRO and continuous
optimal transport demonstrate the advantages of our approach over
state-of-the-art baselines and the effective treatment of numerical issues
associated with the standard LogSumExp and KL.

TL;DR: Traditional search engines in the environmental science domain struggle with multi-intent queries. This paper introduces an automated evaluation dataset and incorporates a Retrieval of Augmented Generation (RAG) approach using Large Language Models (LLMs), resulting in improved query precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current search engines, including those powered by knowledge bases like Elasticsearch, often fail to understand user intent, especially for multi-intent queries, leading to incomplete or inaccurate results. This gap is notably significant in environmental and earth sciences due to the vast and complex datasets involved.

Method: The study introduced an automated method to curate a domain-specific evaluation dataset for analyzing search systems. It also incorporated Retrieval of Augmented Generation (RAG) using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable high-quality, natural language-based data retrieval.

Result: The analysis demonstrated that LLM-based retrieval systems show higher precision in generating results for complex queries with multiple intents, outperforming Elasticsearch in this domain.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves the precision and understanding of environmental domain-specific queries, offering a significant advancement over traditional Elasticsearch systems.

Abstract: Classical search engines using indexing methods in data infrastructures
primarily allow keyword-based queries to retrieve content. While these
indexing-based methods are highly scalable and efficient, due to a lack of an
appropriate evaluation dataset and a limited understanding of semantics, they
often fail to capture the user's intent and generate incomplete responses
during evaluation. This problem also extends to domain-specific search systems
that utilize a Knowledge Base (KB) to access data from various research
infrastructures. Research infrastructures (RIs) from the environmental and
earth science domain, which encompass the study of ecosystems, biodiversity,
oceanography, and climate change, generate, share, and reuse large volumes of
data. While there are attempts to provide a centralized search service using
Elasticsearch as a knowledge base, they also face similar challenges in
understanding queries with multiple intents. To address these challenges, we
proposed an automated method to curate a domain-specific evaluation dataset to
analyze the capability of a search system. Furthermore, we incorporate the
Retrieval of Augmented Generation (RAG), powered by Large Language Models
(LLMs), for high-quality retrieval of environmental domain data using natural
language queries. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis of the evaluation
dataset shows that LLM-based systems for information retrieval return results
with higher precision when understanding queries with multiple intents,
compared to Elasticsearch-based systems.

### [1391] [Fairness for niche users and providers: algorithmic choice and profile portability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22660)
*Elizabeth McKinnie,Anas Buhayh,Clement Canel,Robin Burke*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper studies the impact of allowing users to choose algorithms in recommender systems, and how user profile handling policies affect fairness for consumers and providers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most fairness studies in recommender systems focus on algorithmic solutions, but there is limited research on structural changes, such as user choice in algorithms.

Method: A simulation approach is used to investigate how different policies regarding user profile portability influence fairness for both consumers and providers.

Result: Simulations reveal insights into how profile portability policies impact fairness outcomes, particularly for niche consumers and providers.

Conclusion: Algorithmic pluralism and user profile portability should be considered important factors in promoting fairness in recommender systems.

Abstract: Ensuring fair outcomes for multiple stakeholders in recommender systems has
been studied mostly in terms of algorithmic interventions: building new models
with better fairness properties, or using reranking to improve outcomes from an
existing algorithm. What has rarely been studied is structural changes in the
recommendation ecosystem itself. Our work explores the fairness impact of
algorithmic pluralism, the idea that the recommendation algorithm is decoupled
from the platform through which users access content, enabling user choice in
algorithms. Prior work using a simulation approach has shown that niche
consumers and (especially) niche providers benefit from algorithmic choice. In
this paper, we use simulation to explore the question of profile portability,
to understand how different policies regarding the handling of user profiles
interact with fairness outcomes for consumers and providers.

### [1392] [Next Point-of-interest (POI) Recommendation Model Based on Multi-modal Spatio-temporal Context Feature Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22661)
*Lingyu Zhang,Guobin Wu,Yan Wang,Pengfei Xu,Jian Liang,Xuan Song,Yunhai Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a POI recommendation model using multimodal spatiotemporal context features and weighted dynamic fusion, achieving superior accuracy compared to existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional POI prediction models often neglect long-term and short-term user preferences along with spatiotemporal context features, which limits prediction accuracy.

Method: The approach involves multimodal spatiotemporal feature embedding, self-attention aggregation, and weighted dynamic fusion to balance long- and short-term preferences, followed by attention-based matching to calculate location probabilities.

Result: Experiments across multiple transportation datasets validate that the proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art POI prediction methods in accuracy.

Conclusion: Incorporating multimodal features and user preference data significantly improves POI prediction accuracy, presenting a promising direction for intelligent transportation applications.

Abstract: The next Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is mainly based on sequential
traffic information to predict the user's next boarding point location. This is
a highly regarded and widely applied research task in the field of intelligent
transportation, and there have been many research results to date. Traditional
POI prediction models primarily rely on short-term traffic sequence
information, often neglecting both long-term and short-term preference data, as
well as crucial spatiotemporal context features in user behavior. To address
this issue, this paper introduces user long-term preference information and key
spatiotemporal context information, and proposes a POI recommendation model
based on multimodal spatiotemporal context feature embedding. The model
extracts long-term preference features and key spatiotemporal context features
from traffic data through modules such as spatiotemporal feature processing,
multimodal embedding, and self-attention aggregation. It then uses a weighted
fusion method to dynamically adjust the weights of long-term and short-term
features based on users' historical behavior patterns and the current context.
Finally, the fused features are matched using attention, and the probability of
each location candidate becoming the next location is calculated. This paper
conducts experimental verification on multiple transportation datasets, and the
results show that the POI prediction model combining multiple types of features
has higher prediction accuracy than existing SOTA models and methods.

*Mengchen Zhao,Yifan Gao,Yaqing Hou,Xiangyang Li,Pengjie Gu,Zhenhua Dong,Ruiming Tang,Yi Cai*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MTRec, a sequential recommendation framework, aligns with user preferences by modeling implicit feedback and mental satisfaction, resulting in better performance and increased user engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of implicit feedback in recommendation systems, where clicks may not reflect actual user preferences.

Method: Introduce a mental reward model using distributional inverse reinforcement learning to align recommendations with user satisfaction.

Result: MTRec improves performance across recommendation models and boosts user engagement on a short video platform, with a 7% increase in viewing time.

Conclusion: MTRec effectively enhances the alignment of recommendations with real user preferences through its innovative mental reward modeling approach.

Abstract: Recommendation models are predominantly trained using implicit user feedback,
since explicit feedback is often costly to obtain. However, implicit feedback,
such as clicks, does not always reflect users' real preferences. For example, a
user might click on a news article because of its attractive headline, but end
up feeling uncomfortable after reading the content. In the absence of explicit
feedback, such erroneous implicit signals may severely mislead recommender
systems. In this paper, we propose MTRec, a novel sequential recommendation
framework designed to align with real user preferences by uncovering their
internal satisfaction on recommended items. Specifically, we introduce a mental
reward model to quantify user satisfaction and propose a distributional inverse
reinforcement learning approach to learn it. The learned mental reward model is
then used to guide recommendation models to better align with users' real
preferences. Our experiments show that MTRec brings significant improvements to
a variety of recommendation models. We also deploy MTRec on an industrial short
video platform and observe a 7 percent increase in average user viewing time.

### [1394] [From Past To Path: Masked History Learning for Next-Item Prediction in Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23649)
*KaiWen Wei,Kejun He,Xiaomian Kang,Jie Zhang,Yuming Yang,Jiang Zhong,He Bai,Junnan Zhu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Masked History Learning (MHL), a generative recommendation approach that improves item prediction by comprehending user interaction history using a masking and reconstruction framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of autoregressive training in generative recommendation systems, which fail to grasp the intent behind a user’s interaction history.

Method: The paper introduces MHL, which augments autoregressive objectives with masked history reconstruction. It uses an entropy-guided masking policy to select key items and a curriculum learning scheduler to transition from history comprehension to future prediction.

Result: MHL outperforms state-of-the-art generative models in experiments conducted on three public datasets, demonstrating the importance of understanding user history for better prediction.

Conclusion: The proposed MHL framework achieves a deeper understanding of user intent and interaction history, leading to more accurate prediction in generative recommendation systems.

Abstract: Generative recommendation, which directly generates item identifiers, has
emerged as a promising paradigm for recommendation systems. However, its
potential is fundamentally constrained by the reliance on purely autoregressive
training. This approach focuses solely on predicting the next item while
ignoring the rich internal structure of a user's interaction history, thus
failing to grasp the underlying intent. To address this limitation, we propose
Masked History Learning (MHL), a novel training framework that shifts the
objective from simple next-step prediction to deep comprehension of history.
MHL augments the standard autoregressive objective with an auxiliary task of
reconstructing masked historical items, compelling the model to understand
``why'' an item path is formed from the user's past behaviors, rather than just
``what'' item comes next. We introduce two key contributions to enhance this
framework: (1) an entropy-guided masking policy that intelligently targets the
most informative historical items for reconstruction, and (2) a curriculum
learning scheduler that progressively transitions from history reconstruction
to future prediction. Experiments on three public datasets show that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generative models, highlighting that
a comprehensive understanding of the past is crucial for accurately predicting
a user's future path. The code will be released to the public.

### [1395] [WARBERT: A Hierarchical BERT-based Model for Web API Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23175)
*Zishuo Xu,Yuhong Gu,Dezhong Yao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces WARBERT, a hierarchical BERT-based model for efficient Web API recommendation, addressing semantic ambiguity and inefficiency challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient Web API recommendation due to the growing number of APIs, along with the limitations of existing methods in terms of semantic clarity, detailed comparison, and time efficiency.

Method: The proposed WARBERT model uses hierarchical BERT-based architecture with dual-component feature fusion and attention comparison. It includes two components: WARBERT(R) for initial filtering and category judgment, and WARBERT(M) for refined similarity matching.

Result: Experimental results on the ProgrammableWeb dataset show that WARBERT significantly outperforms most existing solutions, achieving up to 11.7% improvement compared to the MTFM model.

Conclusion: WARBERT delivers notable improvements in accuracy and efficiency for Web API recommendation by effectively addressing semantic and time inefficiency challenges.

Abstract: With the emergence of Web 2.0 and microservices architecture, the number of
Web APIs has increased dramatically, further intensifying the demand for
efficient Web API recommendation. Existing solutions typically fall into two
categories: recommendation-type methods, which treat each API as a label for
classification, and match-type methods, which focus on matching mashups through
API retrieval. However, three critical challenges persist: 1) the semantic
ambiguities in comparing API and mashup descriptions, 2) the lack of detailed
comparisons between the individual API and the mashup in recommendation-type
methods, and 3) time inefficiencies for API retrieval in match-type methods. To
address these challenges, we propose WARBERT, a hierarchical BERT-based model
for Web API recommendation. WARBERT leverages dual-component feature fusion and
attention comparison to extract precise semantic representations of API and
mashup descriptions. WARBERT consists of two main components: WARBERT(R) for
Recommendation and WARBERT(M) for Matching. Specifically, WAR-BERT(R) serves as
an initial filter, narrowing down the candidate APIs, while WARBERT(M) refines
the matching process by calculating the similarity between candidate APIs and
mashup. The final likelihood of a mashup being matched with an API is
determined by combining the predictions from WARBERT(R) and WARBERT(M).
Additionally, WARBERT(R) incorporates an auxiliary task of mashup category
judgment, which enhances its effectiveness in candidate selection. Experimental
results on the ProgrammableWeb dataset demonstrate that WARBERT outperforms
most existing solutions and achieves improvements of up to 11.7% compared to
the model MTFM (Multi-Task Fusion Model), delivering significant enhancements
in accuracy and effiency.

*Junwei Lan,Jianlyu Chen,Zheng Liu,Chaofan Li,Siqi Bao,Defu Lian*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Retro* introduces a reasoning-based document retrieval model using rubric-based scoring and scoring integration, outperforming other methods on the BRIGHT benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of retrieving indirectly or implicitly relevant documents essential for solving a task, a limitation in current information retrieval (IR) techniques.

Method: Retro* uses a rubric-based scoring mechanism for reasoning-intensive relevance assessment and implements reinforcement learning with composite rewards to enhance retrieval capabilities.

Result: Retro* achieves state-of-the-art performance in document retrieval on the BRIGHT benchmark, demonstrating superiority over existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques in Retro*, including fine-grained reasoning and relevance scoring, improve document retrieval effectiveness and interpretability, resolving key challenges in existing IR systems.

Abstract: With the growing popularity of LLM agents and RAG, it has become increasingly
important to retrieve documents that are essential for solving a task, even
when their connection to the task is indirect or implicit. Addressing this
problem requires fine-grained reasoning to accurately assess the relevance
between the task and each candidate document. This capability, however, poses a
significant challenge for existing IR techniques. Despite recent progress in
reasoning-enhanced IR, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
applicability, scalability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose Retro*, a
novel approach for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our method
introduces a rubric-based relevance scoring mechanism, enabling the model to
reason about the relationship between a task and a document based on explicitly
defined criteria, whereby producing a fine-grained, interpretable relevance
score. Retro* also supports test-time scaling by combining multiple reasoning
trajectories via score integration, which produces more reliable relevance
estimates. To optimize Retro*'s reasoning capabilities, we introduce a novel
reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for its relevance scoring mechanism,
which employs two composite rewards to fully exploit the trajectories of each
training sample. Our experiments show that Retro* outperforms existing document
retrieval methods with notable advantages, leading to state-of-the-art
performance on the BRIGHT benchmark.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces GSID, a data-driven approach for creating structured product representations to improve e-commerce efficiency, particularly on second-hand platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency of current approaches in organizing product information, especially for long-tail products and buyer preferences on second-hand e-commerce platforms.

Method: GSID utilizes pre-training on unstructured metadata for semantic embeddings and generates semantic codes tailored for product-centric applications.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate GSID's effectiveness, and its deployment on real-world e-commerce platforms has shown promising improvements in product understanding and related tasks.

Conclusion: GSID provides a significant advancement in organizing product information, aligning representations better with buyer preferences and improving e-commerce efficiency.

Abstract: Structured representation of product information is a major bottleneck for
the efficiency of e-commerce platforms, especially in second-hand ecommerce
platforms. Currently, most product information are organized based on manually
curated product categories and attributes, which often fail to adequately cover
long-tail products and do not align well with buyer preference. To address
these problems, we propose \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{S}emantic
\textbf{I}n\textbf{D}exings (GSID), a data-driven approach to generate product
structured representations. GSID consists of two key components: (1)
Pre-training on unstructured product metadata to learn in-domain semantic
embeddings, and (2) Generating more effective semantic codes tailored for
downstream product-centric applications. Extensive experiments are conducted to
validate the effectiveness of GSID, and it has been successfully deployed on
the real-world e-commerce platform, achieving promising results on product
understanding and other downstream tasks.

*Huike Zou,Haiyang Yang,Yindu Su,Liyu Chen,Chengbao Lian,Qingheng Zhang,Shuguang Han,Jufeng Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel method, MVP-RAG, for Product Attribute Value Identification (PAVI) using a combination of retrieval, generation, and classification, showcasing superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the identification of product attributes for various applications in e-commerce faces challenges such as cascading errors, handling out-of-distribution values, and poor generalization capability.

Method: The MVP-RAG model treats PAVI as a retrieval-generation problem, involving a multi-level retrieval scheme to fetch similar products and attribute values followed by generation of standardized values using a large language model.

Result: The MVP-RAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines as demonstrated in comprehensive experiments, and is successfully deployed in industrial setups.

Conclusion: The proposed MVP-RAG method shows strong potential for addressing major PAVI challenges and improving practical applications in e-commerce.

Abstract: Identifying attribute values from product profiles is a key task for
improving product search, recommendation, and business analytics on e-commerce
platforms, which we called Product Attribute Value Identification (PAVI) .
However, existing PAVI methods face critical challenges, such as cascading
errors, inability to handle out-of-distribution (OOD) attribute values, and
lack of generalization capability. To address these limitations, we introduce
Multi-Value-Product Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MVP-RAG), combining the
strengths of retrieval, generation, and classification paradigms. MVP-RAG
defines PAVI as a retrieval-generation task, where the product title
description serves as the query, and products and attribute values act as the
corpus. It first retrieves similar products of the same category and candidate
attribute values, and then generates the standardized attribute values. The key
advantages of this work are: (1) the proposal of a multi-level retrieval
scheme, with products and attribute values as distinct hierarchical levels in
PAVI domain (2) attribute value generation of large language model to
significantly alleviate the OOD problem and (3) its successful deployment in a
real-world industrial environment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that MVP-RAG performs better than the state-of-the-art baselines.

*Mingshi Xu,Haoren Zhu,Wilfred Siu Hung Ng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIQ-Attn, a new attention mechanism that uses multiple query vectors to reduce noise and improve performance in sequential recommendation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequential recommendation systems struggle with instability and noise in user interaction data, and existing models dependent on single-query attention are especially vulnerable.

Method: The authors developed the Multi-Item-Query attention mechanism (MIQ-Attn), which generates diverse query vectors from user interactions to better handle noise and inconsistencies.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that MIQ-Attn enhances performance significantly on benchmark datasets compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: MIQ-Attn is a viable and effective alternative to single-query attention mechanisms for improving stability and accuracy in recommendation systems.

Abstract: The inherent instability and noise in user interaction data challenge
sequential recommendation systems. Prevailing masked attention models, relying
on a single query from the most recent item, are sensitive to this noise,
reducing prediction reliability. We propose the Multi-Item-Query attention
mechanism (MIQ-Attn) to enhance model stability and accuracy. MIQ-Attn
constructs multiple diverse query vectors from user interactions, effectively
mitigating noise and improving consistency. It is designed for easy adoption as
a drop-in replacement for existing single-query attention. Experiments show
MIQ-Attn significantly improves performance on benchmark datasets.
